# Data

This folder contains all the data that we will use in the course, as well as the
scripts that I used to get the data.

**Overview**

* Linguistlist is a collection of messages from the Linguist List. They were
    downloaded from [here](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/)
    using [get_linguist_data.py](./scripts/get_linguist_data.py).
