# Data

This folder contains all the data that we will use in the course, as well as the
scripts that I used to get the data.

**Overview**

* `linguistlist` is a collection of messages from the Linguist List. They were
    downloaded from [here](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/linglite/)
    using [get_linguist_data.py](./scripts/get_linguist_data.py). All data is
    gzipped, except for [this example](./linguistlist/example/2015-August.txt).
* `MSCOCO` contains image annotations, provided by Microsoft Research. These were
    downloadeded from [here](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download).
* The `concreteness` folder contains concreteness ratings downloaded from [here](http://crr.ugent.be/archives/1330).
