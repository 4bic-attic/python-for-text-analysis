# Exam

In week 8 of this course, we will have an exam that tests your knowledge of the Python programming language. For the BA students, this is the final exam that will enable you to show what you have learnt and that you are familiar with the basics of programming. For the MA students, it is primarily meant as a check to assure that your knowledge of the language is sufficient to tackle the final assignment.

This folder contains sample exams from previous years. Note that these **may not be completely representative for the exam you will have** because the course material has slightly changed over the years. But we will discuss everything you need to know for the exam in class, and we will provide you with a representative dummy exam so that you know exactly what will be expected from you.

At the moment there are two sample exams (and one dummy exam). As the course develops over the year, this collection will grow.

Note that this concerns an exam **on paper**. In previous years, some of the students felt a bit uncomfortable with this form. We want to emphasize that as long as you keep up with the course material and weekly assignments, this exam should not be too hard.
