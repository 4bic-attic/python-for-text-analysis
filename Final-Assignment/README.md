# Final assignment

The exact details of the final assignment are to be determined. If you come up with
an interesting task of your own, we are happy to turn that into an assignment as well.

You can expect a project in which you are asked to:

1. process a number of files;
2. extract relevant information from those files;
3. present that information to the user;
4. store the information in a useful format

## 5-minute presentation

You'll also have to present your work in the last session of the course. This is
useful for several reasons. First, we want you to reflect on the way you've handled
your project. Second, it's useful to see how other people tackle similar problems.
Third, your fellow students' work may be useful to you in the future as well. We'd
like to encourage you to check out what your classmates did.

## Preparation for the presentation

Here are some questions to help you reflect on your project. You don't need to
address all of these points in your presentation (5 minutes is *really* short!).
Just highlight the points that are most important for you.

* What did you do?
* How did you do it?
    - What modules did you use? What are they useful for?
    - What kind of data did you use? How did you get it?
    - How did you manage your project? What did your workflow look like?
* How can others use or build on your project?
* What was the greatest challenge for you?
* What took the largest amount of time? (try to keep track of this)
* What would you do differently next time?

In terms of format, you can choose any kind of presentation that you like (powerpoint, notebook, web demo, ...).

## Grading

We will consider the following questions (along with the core principles) to evaluate your final assignment:

* Does the code work?
* Does the code fulfill the requirements?
* Is the code well-documented?
* Is the code clear and understandable?
* Is the code modular?
* Is the code easily extensible?
* How scalable is the solution?
* Is the code written in accordance with [the community standards](http://pep8.org/)? (That is: PEP8)
* Are there tests to ensure that the code works?
