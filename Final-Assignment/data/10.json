Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nPublic complaints about a \" command and control \" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. \n\nIn February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for\u00a0political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. \n\nMs Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. \n \nBrian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nBut Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he\u00a0singled out his chief of staff \u00a0\"who has been unfairly maligned by people who\u00a0should've\u00a0known better\". \n\nAnd now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. \n\nMr\u00a0Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. \n\nOne veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader,\u00a0and that a change in director was not \"necessary or inevitable\". \n\nThat veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of \"competitive tension\" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \n\n\"It depends on the relationship between the two of them;\u00a0[Mr Loughnane] has served every\u00a0leader\u00a0since Howard.     \u00a0But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director \u2013 you can't have a situation like [former prime minister]\u00a0Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].\" \n\nA second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was \"very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on.\u00a0The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.\" \n\nFairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. \n\nThe former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department,\u00a0Drew Clarke, will serve as his\u00a0acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt,\u00a0who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos\u00a0in the office of John Howard,\u00a0will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. \n\nSenator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude\u00a0of Mr\u00a0Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach,\u00a0\"and\u00a0have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,\" he told Sky News. \n\n\"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off;\u00a0the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \n\n\"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.\" \n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook . \n\nFollow us on Twitter", "source": "Brisbane Times"}
