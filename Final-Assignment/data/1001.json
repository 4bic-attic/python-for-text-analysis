I\u2019m massively excited about this episode and want to let you jump right in, so I\u2019ll make this summary brief; today I have the huge honor of talking with Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, on the podcast. \n \nSecretary Duncan\u2019s main message throughout our conversation? Graduate, graduate, graduate . He is laser-focused on improving graduation rates all over the country, both through initiatives to increase student aid and programs to help students perform better academically. \n \nBeyond graduations rates, though, the conversation touches on picking a college, paying for school and dealing with student debt, and we also talk a bit about Secretary Duncan\u2019s journey to becoming a member of the President\u2019s Cabinet (which included a few years as a professional basketball player). \n \nI\u2019m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to conduct this interview; seriously, even as I\u2019m writing this, it\u2019s still hard to believe this episode is a reality when this podcast started with me rambling\u00a0about exercise from my tiny apartment in the middle of Iowa. \n \nEnjoy the episode! \n \nThings mentioned in this episode: \n  U.S. Dept. of Education  Information on Federal student loans  FAFSA  Don\u2019t pay for student loan debt relief  Secretary Duncan\u2019s recent article on improving graduation rates   \nWant more cool stuff?
