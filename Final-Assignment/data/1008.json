Latausha Nedd, who goes by the pseudonym Eye Empress Sekhmet online,\u00a0was arrestedThursday by the FBI and U.S. Marshals over threats she posted on YouTube against whites and police. Nedd was reportedly watching a news report about herself when authorities arrived at her house. A news crew from WSB Channel 2 was at the scene during the arrest. \u201cYou really want people to kill cops?\u201d Nedd was asked as she was escorted to a waiting police cruiser. Neddreplied, \u201cI never said that.\u201d From inside the police cruiser she added, \u201cAll I said was defend yourself against people who want to kill us. That\u2019s all. I never said anything more than that.\u201d The video in which Nedd made the threats appears to have been taken down, but copies are available online. In one segment, Nedd holds a machete in one hand and points a handgun at the camera with the other as\u00a0she says, \u201cRight now we declare, it\u2019s open season on a motherf\u2013king cracker. All you motherf\u2013king crackers y\u2019all need to watch your motherf\u2013king heads.\u201d Elsewhere in the video, Nedd suggests taking action against police. \u201cI say let\u2019s have a take a gun day, and start walking up on these untrained and stealing their weapons,\u201d\u00a0she says. She also suggests trying to take over a police station. Nedd lives less than two miles from the Clayton County police headquarters. Local residents interviewed by WSB Channel 2 were disturbed by Nedd\u2019s call for violence. \u201cThis is alarming. It really is,\u201d one black gentleman told WSB. Sometime yesterday, before her arrest, Nedd uploaded another clip in which she says, \u201cAll you motherf\u2013kers got me f\u2013ked up!\u201d The description beneath the video reads, \u201cSending me death threats really???? But you have no problem with the systematic killing of blacks really? Stop your madness white supremacy and white privilege got you thinking you still own slaves well you don\u2019t Stop killing blacks!\u201d Nedd\u00a0appeared in court\u00a0Friday morning and was denied bond by a judge. http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/09/black-lives-matter-f-yo-flag-activist-arrested-for-video-threats-to-kill-white-people-police/ http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/25/georgia-woman-arrested-threats-police-white-people/", "source": "Central-Illinoisand_beyond"}
