Rafael Fernandez with Metro police spoke to the church at Woodbine\u2019s Joy Club on Tuesday about the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to everybody about the bump and rob,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cHas everybody heard of the bump and rob?\u201d\n\nPolice said the bump and rob is when criminals purposely run into the back of a victim\u2019s car. When it\u2019s time to exchange information, the thieves then rob them and often take their car.\n\n\u201cAnother situation is where they pull out in front of you really quickly, hit the brakes and then you hit them,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nPolice don\u2019t want to alarm people. At the South Precinct, they have had two or three victims of the technique, but not enough to send out an email warning the public.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already upset and you\u2019re already like \u2026 I hope they have insurance,\u201d said Akeylah Robinson, a victim of bump and rob. \u201cBut then you have to worry about is this person going to rob my car? Which is really scary.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, Robinson left her car running when it was stolen and used in a bump and rob.\n\n\u201cHe actually used my car to hit another family, a husband and wife and two small children, in the back,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what I heard, at gunpoint told them to get out of the car, fired the gun and took their vehicle. And used it in another wreck.\u201d\n\nFernandez said drivers should be aware of their surroundings.\n\n\u201cLower the window a little bit. Lock your doors,\u201d he said. \u201cEvaluate, see if these people are quick to rush to your car. If they have something in their hands, like a weapon, then you want to leave there right away.\u201d\n\nIf there are children in the car, let the other driver know.\n\n\u201cAt least put it out there and let them know,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a child in the car. You take my child, you\u2019re talking kidnapping.\u201d\n\nPolice said most importantly, do what the thieves ask. Chances are good police will find the stolen vehicle.\n\nPolice have already solved a bump and rob that happened last week on Bell Road.\n\n\u201cWe want people to keep things in perspective,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cWe want everybody to be safe. It\u2019s property, you can get that replaced.\u201d\n\nPolice said as soon as they are in a fender bender, drivers should write down the license plate number and a few things about the occupants of the other vehicle. If they are approached by someone with a weapon who appears agitated, police said drivers should leave their keys and purse in the car, get out quickly, and leave the area immediately.", "source": "WMCTV.com"}
