You can?t put up ropes,? Redgranite Fire Chief Jim Angelo said of efforts to keep the quarry safe.\nYoung people gather at the quarry Tuesday, August 18, 2015, in Redgranite, Wis. \nDan Powers/Post-Crescent Media (Photo: Dan Powers/Post-Crescent Media, Dan Powers/Post-Crescent Media) Buy Photo \n\nThe Redgranite Village Board resolved\u00a0Tuesday to keep Redgranite Quarry Park open after discussing the matter at a special meeting prompted by recent calls to close the park after\u00a0three people died there this summer. \n\nAfter emerging from\u00a0closed session, board members said the quarry would remain open, with increased fines for violations and more signs warning of the\u00a0danger of swimming in the quarry. The board did not vote to keep the quarry open, but will decide on specific measures at a future meeting. \n\n\u201cThe city has committed to keeping this open for people to swim in,\u201d said board member Paul Wertz. \n\nThe village went into closed session for nearly an hour, citing protection from an exemption in Wisconsin Open Meetings law that allows municipalities to meet to discuss ongoing or likely lawsuits. \n\nPersonal Injury Attorney Mike Siddall\u00a0of Fox Valley firm Herring Clark has\u00a0requested police reports and other documents related to the death of Alaya HauChee Lo, who drowned at the quarry in June.\u00a0Siddall did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday. Wertz said the board isn\u2019t aware of any\u00a0litigation in progress. \n\nBoard President Jerry Sieg said a committee will be created next spring\u00a0to draft safety\u00a0measures such\u00a0as\u00a0new signs, Facebook calls for safety and a beefed-up police presence. \n\nSieg said the board took into account requests from\u00a0Redgranite residents, who want\u00a0the quarry to remain open. \n\n\u201cPeople enjoy it and the majority of people that live in Redgranite are for it,\u201d Sieg said. \u201cAnd we kind of go by our constituents.\u201d \n\nAbout 20 people attended a village board meeting Sept. 15 to voice concerns about the quarry\u2019s safety after a Post-Crescent Media editorial called for the\u00a0closure of\u00a0the quarry. An earlier Post-Crescent Media story found that 19 people have\u00a0died there since 1979. \n\nDuring the meeting,\u00a0Sieg said police have issued more than 125 citations at the quarry between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, including\u00a0more than 50 tickets for possessing alcohol on quarry grounds, and another 24 citations for underage drinking. \n\nMost recently, Illinois resident\u00a0Marquis Hough\u00a0drowned at the quarry over Labor Day weekend. Redgranite officials cleared the quarry after he went missing on Sept. 6. His body was recovered the next morning. \n\nRedgranite Police Chief Kyle Tarr said police have not yet received Hough\u2019s toxicology results from the Fond du Lac County Medical Examiner, or results from this year\u2019s second victim, Daniel Whitmore of Green Bay, who drowned at the\u00a0quarry on Aug. 12. \n\nJohn Kroll, a lifelong Redgranite resident, attended Tuesday's\u00a0meeting\u00a0and said he\u2019s \u201csatisfied\u00a0with the board\u2019s decision to keep the quarry open. \n\n\u201cI grew up here,\u201d Kroll said. \u201cI hear everybody saying, they\u2019re making money on (the quarry). Nobody\u2019s making money on it. And the alcohol\u2019s coming from outside.\u201d \n\nNate Beck writes for Oshkosh Northwestern Media.\u00a0 \n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1FCzZ1Y", "source": "Post Crescent"}
