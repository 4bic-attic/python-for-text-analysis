Turns out in practice, that\u2019s harder to execute. I don\u2019t know about you, but as a working mom who is also trying to complete the first draft of her novel, I juggle so many balls, it\u2019s hard to execute that protection order.\u00a0\nBut, sometimes? Sometimes I am my own worst enemy. I could protect the work, but I don\u2019t, not because I don\u2019t want to, but because I don\u2019t believe in the value of what I\u2019m doing. That\u2019s PAID work, it MUST come first. Surely that non-profit organization needs my time and efforts more than my silly little story. My brain is a manipulative witch sometimes. I know my strengths and when a client, or group I belong to needs me to fill a role that plays to my strengths instead of protecting the work, I say yes. It\u2019s the path of least resistance and it\u2019s instant gratification. I\u2019ve got a decent track record in marketing, communications and event planning. So I\u2019ll do those for the positive strokes rather than toil on my writing where it\u2019s a long, lonely and uncertain road.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have lots of support but no one can get THIS story down on paper but me.\u00a0\nThis all came to a head recently. I feel strongly that non-profits are can be only truly successful when all members contribute. This particular commitment had changed in a way I hadn't anticipated.\u00a0As I planned out my\u00a0day in my head, I realized that in order to address this change, I was going to have to sacrifice my writing time. That stopped me in my tracks. I\u2019ve been on a roll lately, adding on average 1,000 words a day to my WIP 4-5 days a week. To some that seems a paltry sum, but to me, it\u2019s a fantastic amount. More important to me was the consistency. I was loathe to break that streak.\u00a0\nIt was a weird feeling to put MY work first, but I did it and in the end, it was the right decision for me. You know what? The world won\u2019t end and my novel is one step closer to getting finished.\u00a0\nI realized that as often as I\u2019ve heard \u201cprotect the work\u201d, I was still waiting for some magical superhero to come in and guard my writing time, or for someone else to say \"no you can't do that, you have to write\". Heh, turns out, *I* have the super powers. *I* protected the work.\u00a0\nI did it this time, but I\u2019m not naive.\u00a0 There will be other times and other challenges. Knowing my personality, I\u2019m always going to need to suck it up and say \u201cbut this matters to ME.\u201d\u00a0 As a matter of fact, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some words to write.\n\nIs protecting the work easy for you, or is it a challenge?", "source": "Live to Write - Write to Live"}
