It was an adorable moment where Mowry-Housley called for her husband, who was backstage, to bring their 3-month-old daughter, Ariah, front and center. Ariah was asleep at first, but all the handling and chit chat woke her up. She didn\u2019t even cry, and Mowry-Housley\u2019s co-hosts gushed about how chill of a baby she was. Aaaaaw!
