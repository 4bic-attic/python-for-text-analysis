Less than 30 percent of SMB organizations leverage any type of accounts payable automation and only 36 percent have automated expense management processes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, only 21 percent of SMB organizations cite their visibility into total spending as \u201cVery Strong,\u201d and according to Ardent Partners, this factor speaks directly to the need for not only managing company spend, but also automation of key spending processes. \n\n\u201cThere should be a new line of thinking among SMBs in terms of managing organizational spend: There is no company too small for holistic, automated spend management,\u201d said Christopher J. Dwyer, research director for Ardent Partners. \u201cIncreasing automation levels across spend management processes (purchasing, accounts payable, and expense management, in particular) is an effective, long-term approach towards not only driving superior cost control, but also greatly enhancing visibility into all facets of organizational spend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new research underscores the value ExpenseWatch provides for small-and-midsized organizations,\u201d said Bill Vergantino, president and CEO of ExpenseWatch. \u201cAs organizations grow, more employees spend money while nearly every position can impact how much money is ultimately spent. With ExpenseWatch, organizations are empowered to automate spending processes and gain visibility and control, while driving cost savings which frees money to be reinvested to grow the business.\u201d\n\nTo download a free copy of How SMBs Can Manage Company Spending, visit http://www.expensewatch.com/?p=5074\n\nAbout ExpenseWatch (http://www.ExpenseWatch.com) \n\nExpenseWatch automates manual, time consuming paper-based processes, for visibility and control over organizational spending, empowering customers to spend with confidence.
