Sales were down 12.5% in Europe and 13.3% in Japan, in part due to currency devaluation. \n \nOn a month-to-month basis, sales increased 2.7% in Japan, 0.6% in China and 0.4% in Europe while falling 0.3% in the Americas and 2.5% in Asia Pacific/other. \n \nSIA also announced a joint release with the Semiconductor Research Corp. of a report highlighting the urgent need for research investments to advance the burgeoning Internet of Things and develop other cutting-edge, semiconductor-driven innovations. \"Implementing the recommendations in the report will help the United States harness new technologies and remain the world\u2019s top innovator,\u201d Neuffer said. \n \nAll monthly sales numbers are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization and represent a three-month moving average. \n \nRegister for PCB West, the Silicon Valley's largest printed circuit trade show, Sept. 15-17 at the Santa Clara Convention Center:\u00a0 pcbwest.com .", "source": "Printed Circuit Design & Manufacture"}
