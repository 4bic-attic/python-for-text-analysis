Through these resources, Continental Mitsubishi intends to better inform car shoppers who are curious about the safety rating process.\n\nToday there are two main agencies conducting crash test research that include the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. While the two are independent of the other and conduct different tests, Continental Mitsubishi tells readers it's important to look at all safety ratings.\n\nIn addition to its blog, Continental Mitsubishi shares industry news and information through model research pages. These pages compare and contrast new models and are a quick reference for car shoppers conducting research.\n\nThe 2016 Outlander is the newest addition to the Continental Mitsubishi family and is currently available for purchase and to test drive. New vehicles coming soon include the 2016 Lancer and the special-edition 2015 Mirage with Rockford-Fosgate technology. Continental Mitsubishi is located at 5800 S. La Grange Road, Countryside, Illinois \n\nMedia Contact: Shannon Bachar \n\nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com\n\nSOURCE Continental Mitsubishi", "source": "Stock Nod"}
