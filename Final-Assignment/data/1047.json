Laura currently suffers from dementia. \n \n\u201cWe knew that this was probably the last time, so we wanted to capture that moment,\u201d Solari told ABC News on Monday. \u201cIt was really loving. \n \n\u201cFor me, right after the video, I was so overcome,\u201d Solari added. \u201cI broke down and started crying. I was so happy that I\u2019d captured this moment for my family. It touched me, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that it touched other people as well.\u201d \n \nThe Gainesville, Florida, couple have nine children and 18 grandchildren. They\u2019ve been married for 73 years. \n \n\u201cThis video is pretty awesome because she\u2019s almost completely blind and he\u2019s fairly deaf, so it\u2019s difficult for them to communicate,\u201d Solari said. \u201cThis kind of thing between them, singing to each other, wasn\u2019t uncommon in our family. They were always singing and dancing and they\u2019d be very vibrant in that way.\u201d \n \nIn the video, Howard strokes his wife\u2019s face as he sings. Laura looks at her husband and mouths the lyrics. \n \nSolari\u2019s heart-warming video was a hit on social media. \n \n\u201cIt [the video] was posted minutes after it happened on Facebook and it had over three million views,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it seems private, but my family is very proud and happy to share this love with the world. As for the feedback, all the love and support we\u2019ve gotten, being around my grandmother, I believe it maybe it had a little bit of an impact of her feeling better. She\u2019s been able to go home and we are very appreciative of that as well.\u201d \n \nAfter being told the video had gone viral, Laura remarked: \u201cI told you Howard that I\u2019d make you famous.\u201d \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2015, ABC Radio.
