The organization's vision is every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, and computer science should be part of core curriculum, alongside other courses such as biology, chemistry or algebra. \n\nAs part of Schafer's outreach projects, this fall he is teaching a course for Lifelong University at UNI called \"Overview of Computer Science Programming with Scratch\" for adult learners to learn about computer programming. For more information on this Lifelong University course, go to www.uni.llu. Schafer also helped start the Cedar Valley CoderDojo program offered in the Waterloo and Cedar Falls public libraries to get kids ages 7 to 17 interested in computer programing.
