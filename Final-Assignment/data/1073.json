Driving west on Main Street in Centralia a week or so ago I noticed a spray-painted gang logo on the building that old-timers \u2014 really old old-timers \u2014 will remember as Centralia Junk Co. It may be my imagination, but it seems to me that there are fewer of those desecrations being painted these days. I\u2019m assuming it may be because owners of facilities that have been hit are repainting those misguided cries for attention quicker than they used to, and that makes them less worthwhile painting in the first place. As I drove past the recent addition I wondered if anyone who paints such things will ever be inclined to feel the least little bit of remorse, some time in the future.", "source": "Lewis County Chronicle"}
