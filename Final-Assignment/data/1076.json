Celebrity chef George Calombaris is on his way. George Calombaris is gearing up for a major assault on the harbour city.\n\nCalombaris and his Made Establishment business partner George Sykiotis have bought a second building to go with the hot dog-thin site they snapped up earlier this year on the corner of Albion and Mary streets, in Surry Hills.\n\n\"We did a site visit a few weeks ago and noticed next door was for sale so purchased [it],\" a spokeswoman for the pair confirmed.\n\nWhile the sale price hasn't been confirmed, it had an asking price close to $2 million through Steffan Ippolito from Oxford Agency. Add in a similar price for the original purchase, plus renovation costs, and the MasterChef host is clearly confident about his Sydney prospects.\n\nMade Establishment is planning a combination of two popular brands, Jimmy Grants and Gazi, in Surry Hills.\n\n\"It will be an entirely new concept that we bring to Sydney,\" the spokeswoman says. \"We're still defining what that will be, but it will be new and it will be Greek.\" The story first appeared on Good Food.", "source": "Busselton Mail"}
