Boldly contemporary, the house maintains a steadfast commitment to preserving the inspiration of a nose from the conception of a fragrance to its completion, displaying an unyielding respect for perfumery as an art form. Strict rules and slick marketing strategies are the antithesis of Laboratorio Olfattivo's ethos, and each nose that works with the house is given free reign to craft a fragrance that is a truly unique expression of their inspiration. This unlimited creative freedom has resulted in a range of truly stunning, challenging, and vital fragrances; scents that hold a special resonance for the creator and give the wearer a unique emotional response to each composition. Created by nose David Maruitte, D\u00e9cou-Vert is a scent characterised by its ambition and subtlety, inspired by his desire to blend three distinct, ostensibly contradictory fragrance types into one harmonious whole. With characteristics of Green, Floral, and Vegetal scents, D\u00e9cou-Vert is truly a 'green discovery', opening up a whole new way of experiencing a green floral fragrance with its herbaceous character and magnificent magnolia accords. A base of musk and light woods, coupled with delicate magnolia pollen, yields a dry down to be savoured throughout the evening and long into a crisp autumnal night.\n\nTo see the entire Laboratorio Olfattivo range, along with our full collection of stunning fine fragrances, check out our perfumery here.\u00a0", "source": "roullier | WHITE"}
