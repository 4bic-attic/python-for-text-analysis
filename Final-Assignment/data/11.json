I believe\u00a0our\u00a0defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly during\u00a0this game and week to week for a few games. \u00a0As I\u2019ve said before I think Narduzzi and Conklin\u2019s\u00a0plan for single\u00a0coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face, at least in this first game. \n \nHere is what I think after reading, writing and digesting all the Pitt footballs news, notes and opinions since Pat Narduzzi signed on the dotted line: \n \nReed\u2019s Take: \n  The game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point.  Conner gets less than 100 yards but scores two TDs.  Passing game will be OK with more use of our TEs and Peterman will impress in his playing time.  We create\u00a0turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing (at least one big pass play) and rushing yards than we hoped\u00a0we would.  Pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win\u2026   \nPitt 27 \u2013 YSU 20 \u00a0 \n \nChip in with your thoughts as to what you think we\u2019ll see and what the outcome will be. \u00a0We\u2019ll take a look at our predictions on Sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game. \n \nNOTE : \u00a0We didn\u2019t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre-game Pitt Blather\u00a0meeting.drink/bull throwing festivities. \u00a0So I\u2019m asking you guys\u00a0to meet\u00a0at the Bettis Grill before the game. \u00a0I\u2019ll be there at around 11:30.\u00a0I\u2019ll try to get there earlier but have a friend\u2019s tailgate in Red 7 to visit also \u2013 he owes me $40 so I have to break his kneecap. \u00a0After that I\u2019ll go over to Bettis\u2019 and then leave around 12:30 or so for the press box. \n \nI can\u2019t wait to see old friends and meet some new Blather followers. \u00a0Again, check the picture out on this post\u2026 I\u2019ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else\u2019s, a blue polo shirt with \u201cBlather\u201d on it and longer hair and a DW style mustache.", "source": "Pitt Blather"}
