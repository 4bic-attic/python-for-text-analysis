The measure rose 0.5 percent to 3,052.78 at Wednesday\u2019s close on turnover 55 percent below the 30-day average. Automakers led gains after the government cut a tax on vehicle purchases. China\u2019s financial markets will be shut from Thursday for weeklong National Day holidays. \n \nThe value of shares traded on mainland bourses plunged 87 percent from the June record as the equity boom turned to bust and the government took unprecedented measures to shore up stocks \u2014 including banning major shareholders from selling and curbing index futures trading. Leveraged wagers, which helped fuel gains in the first half of the year, have tumbled by 60 percent since the peak, while the government has wiped out nearly 70 percent of unregulated margin lending. President Xi Jinping said last week equities have entered a phase of \u201cself recovery,\u201d signaling policy makers will pare back support as volatility subsides. \n \n\u201cThe government\u2019s clampdown on non-compliant margin financing has hit the Chinese equity markets hard,\u201d said Bernard Aw, a strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. \u201cWe however may see some upside potential in the fourth quarter, as much of non-compliant margin trading accounts have been cleared. Further weakness in the Chinese economy may see investors keeping to the sidelines.\u201d \n \nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.9 percent, paring its losses this quarter to 28 percent.
