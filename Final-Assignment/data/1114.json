Scientists at the EPFL Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne have made tiny, tiny, tiny robots using shape memory alloys, or SMA s for short. They weigh less than 4 grams and move like an inchworm Unlike regular robots that feature rigid structures and electric actuators, the researchers opted to take more of an origami like approach so much so, they call it robogami. Their very first attempt was years ago, and was rather large. Since then they ve shrunk it down to about the size of a compact flash card. The way it works is read more \n\nLes mots cl\u00e9s de la revue de presse pour cet article : robot \n\nLes videos sur SecuObs pour les mots cl\u00e9s : robot", "source": "SecuObs.com"}
