The car has been feeling good and there is great pace from the team.\u2019 \n \nDespite being slower than Hamilton throughout both sessions, Nico\u00a0Rosberg briefly threatened to record the day\u2019s quickest laps before losing time relative to his teammate in the final sector of his last flying lap. \n \n\u2018I lost it in the last two corners and I\u2019m not happy about that because he just seems to be quicker there at the moment,\u2019 the German rued. \u2018I definitely need to work on that tonight and look at his on-board to figure out what he is doing differently and try to do the same tomorrow.\u2019 \n \nFerrari, meanwhile, are braced for a tough weekend at their home race. \n \nSignificantly slower than the works Mercedes cars after the world champions spent their remaining engine development tokens to introduce new power units at a circuit where 70% of the lap is run at full throttle, the Scuderia look to be under threat just to be the best of the rest from the Mercedes-powered customer teams of Force India, Lotus and Williams. \n \n\u2018We can and we have to improve for tomorrow,\u2019 admitted Sebastian Vettel. \u2018It\u2019s always difficult to tell where people are on Friday, but they are very strong. It\u2019s no surprise \u2013 if they are not on the front row tomorrow that would be a surprise but we like surprises so we\u2019ll do our utmost to turn things around.\u2019 \n \nThe Mercedes cars were described as \u2018sensational\u2019 by Sky F1 pundit Martin Brundle from his vantage point as a trackside observer, although the subsequent rain showers will have since washed away the grip levels built up from Friday\u2019s running. \n \nWhile the remainder of Saturday isn\u2019t yet completely clear of rain threats, conditions are set fair for race day when Mercedes will be confident of extending their lead of the Constructors\u2019 Championship beyond 200 points. \n \nThe post appeared first on Island FM .", "source": "Island FM"}
