Adam Higson and Fuifui Moimoi touched down within nine minutes of the re-start to reduce their arrears to just eight points. \n \nBut that was close as Leigh came to following up last week\u2019s encouraging victory over Sheffield Eagles. \n \nHalifax steadied their nerves to put the game out of reach with tries from Scott Murrell and Ste Tyrer. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nEx-St Helens prospect Tyrer finished the game with 18 points, adding seven goals to his 60th minute touch down. Dane Manning, Ross Divorty and James Saltonstall crossed for Halifax\u2019s remaining tries. \n \nLeigh\u2019s route to the top flight now looks limited to a winner takes all clash between the fourth and fifth placed teams.", "source": "Bury Times"}
