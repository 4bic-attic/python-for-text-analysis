The second one is. This past Tuesday, teams were required to cut their rosters from the 90 men they were permitted to bring to training camp to 75. By 4 p.m. Saturday, teams will be required to cut to the regular-season limit of 53. In the Patriots\u2019 case that means at least 21 of the players who were on their active roster for Thursday night\u2019s 12-9 loss to the New York Giants in the teams\u2019 preseason finale at Gillette Stadium will no longer be there come Saturday night. While the Patriots are currently at 75, with running back LeGarrette Blount staring at a one-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy, they\u2019ll be allowed to actually carry 54 players into the regular season. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate part of the game when you can\u2019t keep all of the players who have worked hard and done everything that you\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said recently. \u201cYou have to make some tough decisions, but that\u2019s part of it. That\u2019s the National Football League. Not the great part of the job.\u201d Don\u2019t think that the Patriots\u2019 active roster will necessarily be set come Saturday night, however. In addition to establishing their 10-man roster (a process that can be undertaken on Sunday), the Patriots made 11 moves involving their active roster following the league\u2019s final cutdown date a year ago. Obviously, in hosting Pittsburgh as the reigning Super Bowl champions in the NFL regular-season kickoff at Gillette on Sept. 10, the Patriots (like the Steelers) will be operating within a much tighter time constraint this year. Who are those guys?: Google the term \u201camateur hour\u201d in today\u2019s Internet world and you\u2019re liable to find a YouTube video of Thursday night\u2019s game. Even under the variable pricing format the Patriots implemented for their season ticket holders a year ago this one was overpriced. Consider some of the central figures in this NFL non-classic: Ryan Lindley threw 45 times, completing 22 for 253 yards and no touchdowns (there weren\u2019t any scored on this night) with one interception in a complete-game effort for the Patriots that concluded with him getting sacked by Giants defensive end Damontre\u2019 Moore and coughing up the ball for a turnover at the New York 12 in the final minute. Ryan Nassib completed 16-of-32 passes for 193 yards and no TDs with no interceptions for the Giants. Tight end Asante Cleveland, he of the zero career receptions in six regular-season games, tied for the Patriots\u2019 team lead with four catches for 38 yards; Page 2 of 2 - Linebacker-defensive lineman Xzavier Dickson, the Patriots\u2019 253rd and last pick in this year\u2019s draft, was the team\u2019s second-leading tackler in the game with seven. Keep those names in mind. Some of them will soon be appearing in the \u201cNFL transactions\u201d section of a newspaper near you. Oh, well, at least those in attendance will always be able to tell their grandchildren about the night they saw Chris Boswell outkick Stephen Gostkowski, four field goals to three, in Foxboro. On this night, Tom Brady didn\u2019t even take the field \u2013 for warmups. A woman\u2019s touch: The officiating crew for the game included line judge Sarah Thomas, the league\u2019s first full-time female official.", "source": "Herald News"}
