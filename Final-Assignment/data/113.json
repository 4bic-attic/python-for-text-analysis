It is one of the most dangerous and hazardous oils in the world. False and inflated promises of tax income for our citizens will be proven. \n\nOur state will realize the labor force to install the pipeline came from out-of-state and the wages went out the border. We will remain with damaged land, a great liability, the anticipation of polluted water, and oh, yes, maybe we should have addressed the issue of eminent domain. \n\nYou say it is not on your property \u2014 it could be next time. Contact the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission today and share your thoughts about the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline Docket HP14-002. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1KEeaxL \nTOP VIDEOS More Stories 0) { %> \n0) { %> \n\n0) { %>", "source": "Argus Leader"}
