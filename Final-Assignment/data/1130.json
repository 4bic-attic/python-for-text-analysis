After 15 minutes, Lee took the hair down from the clips and brushed out the curls with a boar bristled brush, then sprayed a mist of hairspray over the head to lock in the look and keep down frizz. 67th Primetime Emmy Awards - Show Kevin Winter / Getty Images Actresses Jamie Lee Curtis, left, and Emma Roberts appear onstage during the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.
