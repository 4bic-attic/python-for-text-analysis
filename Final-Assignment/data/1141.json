And while he spent more than four hours at the Iowa State Fair last month, he had yet to experience a continuous stream of fanfare like he saw on Saturday, where he was given rock star treatment from the crushing mob of people for more than 70 minutes. \n\nHis visit to Athens marked the first of three SEC football games that Bush will attend this fall, all part of an effort to court voters in the March 1 primary that will involve eight Southern states and deliver the nominating season\u2019s first huge haul of delegates in one day. \n\nAfter he worked his way to the stage, he was met by Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who endorsed Bush last month and introduced the candidate as someone who \u201cstands for everything that the party needs to be espousing.\u201d \n\nBush, with signs behind him that tweaked his \u201cJeb!\u201d campaign logo to look like the SEC logo, spoke for only three minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to be very brief because I really like taking selfies,\u201d he said to big cheers from the crowd. \n\nThe candidate performed a condensed version of his stump speech, promising to grow the economy by 4.4% so that students can get jobs when they graduate and buy homes. \u201cA conservative can win the presidency and then fix these things so that you all will have a chance to live a great life,\u201d he said. \n\nThen it was back to selfies for another 50 minutes. \n\nFollowing his widely praised performance at the CNN debate on Wednesday, Bush hasn\u2019t been as eager to bring up contrasts with his rival, Donald Trump, by name in his speeches as he has been in recent weeks. \n\nStill, Bush jumped at the chance to mock Trump at one point Saturday when a voter near him commented on Bush being \u201chigh energy.\u201d The former governor whipped around to follow up: \u201cVery high energy!\u201d \n\nFriday night at an event in Michigan, Bush pounced on the latest controversy involving Trump and a supporter who argued at a rally this week that the president was a Muslim and questioned his status as an American. Bush defended Obama on Friday night, asserting that he was an American and a Christian. \n\nThe initial incident, which Trump didn\u2019t try to correct or denounce, renewed dialogue about tension in the United States between Muslims and non-Muslims. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a problem with Muslims in America,\u201d Bush told reporters Saturday. \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with Islamic terrorism in the rest of the world and we need to confront that.\u201d \n\nBush added that \u201cof course\u201d Obama was born in the United States. Pressed on whether Trump should apologize for not calling out the questioner at his rally, Bush declined to weigh in further. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really, I\u2019m here watching the football game. Donald Trump\u2019s not really on my mind anymore,\u201d he said. \n\nThough the two quarreled Wednesday night in the debate, they also high-fived each other toward the end. Bush said Saturday that he doesn\u2019t hold any \u201cpersonal animus\u201d against Trump, but when asked whether Trump should still apologize to his wife for invoking her in the debate about immigration, Bush said: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Absolutely.\u201d \n\nThis week, Bush also got some attention from younger voters after he admitted on the debate stage that he smoked marijuana four decades ago. \u201cI\u2019m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people,\u201d he said, looking around at his rivals on stage. \u201cMy mom\u2019s not happy that I just did.\u201d \n\nAsked Saturday whether he had heard from his mother yet, Bush said he tried calling the former first lady this week but she wasn\u2019t available. \u201cThankfully, she wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she\u2019ll forgive me after 42 years, you think?\u201d \n\nWith a few crushed beer cans on the grass around him and the smell of alcohol in the air, it was clear that at least some of the enthusiasm at the boisterous tailgate was owed to normal game day libations. Only water was served at the event, but anyone was free to wander over and several came with drinks in tow. \n\nBush politely advised a couple of young people to pace themselves.\u201dSlow down there,\u201d he said to one young woman who was keenly fascinated with a sticker on his shirt. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to kickoff yet.\u201d \n\nAs for who the candidate was rooting for at the game, Bush said he was neutral, though he predicted Georgia would beat the Gamecocks. \n\n\u201cI think Georgia\u2019s going to win the SEC East,\u201d he added, as he was taking photos with a few South Carolina fans. \n\nThe Georgia fans quickly broke out into loud cheers: \u201cJeb for 2", "source": "WXOK-AM"}
