At Brentford, Garner, May and Doyle all started.\n\nIt was Keane and May in the Bournemouth tie, with Hugill joining the action as a sub and getting on the scoresheet.\n\nGarner and Keane started against Wolves, a pairing which was broken up within 20 minutes by Garner\u2019s red card.\n\nKeane continued as a lone striker until the 65th minute when Hugill took that mantle.\n\nMay will obviously be keen to start on Saturday \u2013 it was the Owls who sold him to PNE after just one season at Hillsborough.\n\nYou cannot ignore Hugill\u2019s claims either, as he has impacted well from the bench.\n\nThe clash with Wednesday will form part of a 6,602-mile road trip for North End in the Championship this season.\n\nResearch done by JustPark shows that if a Preston fan drove to every league game, they would spend \u00a31,075 and be on the road for 112 hours.\n\nThe longest trip of the season comes next month with a first ever visit to league leaders Brighton\u2019s Amex Stadium.\n\nThat is a 568-mile round-trip by car, taking around eight-and-a-half hours.\n\nIn total, Championship clubs and their supporters will travel a total of 155,000 miles this season.\n\nBrighton have the most travelling to do, with 8,758 miles on the clock by the end of the season.\n\nDerby will spend the least time on the road, covering 4,914 miles from their East Midlands starting-point.\n\nJustPark is a parking app which allows football fans to book cut-price parking spaces on local driveways when attending matches.", "source": "Lancashire Evening Post"}
