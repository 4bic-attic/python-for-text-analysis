It's going to be good.\" \n\nParker was visibly ecstatic in the closing moments of Friday's preliminary final success over the Sydney Roosters, pumping up the capacity Suncorp Stadium crowd as the clocked ticked towards fulltime. \n\nThe backrower says he couldn't be prouder to have been a part of Brisbane's journey back to the game's pinnacle. \n\n\"It's pretty special mate,\" he said. \n\n\"It's been an amazing ride. Where we've come as a side, to where we are right now, it's been a hell of a journey. \n\n\"It gets better. It does get better.\"", "source": "Nine MSN"}
