City Councilman Rafael Espinoza has sought historic designation of the home on the left. (Jon Murray, The Denver Post) \n \nUPDATE:  The Landmark Preservation Commission will have a hearing on the issue Oct. 6. \n \nThe ball is now back in the city of Denver\u2019s court in a preservation fight that pits neighborhood activists and a City Council member against a Jefferson Park homeowner who wants to sell his property to a developer. \n \nA court recently rejected the developer\u2019s challenge of the city\u2019s decision to accept a preservation application filed by a group including Councilman Rafael Espinoza, who signed it before he took office July 20. But a stay remained on the Landmark Preservation Commission\u2019s process until late last week, when the judge lifted it, according to a Denver Community Planning and Development spokeswoman. \n \nRafael Espinoza \n \nThat means the clock has restarted. The commission and, if needed, the City Council have about 90 days left to decide whether to designate James Sonnleitner\u2019s Queen Anne-style house on Eliot Street as a historic landmark, as Espinoza and his partners argue is merited. \n \nSuch status would prevent demolition \u2014 but it also could imperil Sonnleitner\u2019s deal to sell the property to Adams Development , which plans to build townhomes in the fast-changing neighborhood. \n \nA spokeswoman for the developer issued this statement Monday on behalf of developer Nathan Adams : \u201cMr. Adams will not appeal the Judge\u2019s ruling. Adams Development plans to support Mr. Sonnleitner in his quest to retain his property rights and not be forced to designate his property as a landmark property.\u201d \n \nA hearing before the preservation commission has been set for 1 p.m. Oct. 6.", "source": "Denver Post"}
