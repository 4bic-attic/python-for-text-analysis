Turn off this feature in iOS 9", "id": "a75b8d6d-79ae-4065-90bf-855553dcb493", "content": "Apple\u2019s latest mobile operating system iOS 9 has brought with it all manner of shiny new features. Some are excellent, but one in particular is a little suspect, promising a better mobile internet experience, if you don\u2019t mind the associated costs, that is. And most of us, I fear, would rather have less-than-perfect\u00a0connectivity than an inflated data bill. \n \nIf you go to \u201cSettings\u201d, then \u201cMobile Data\u201d, and scroll right to the bottom, you\u2019ll find something called \u201cWi-Fi Assist\u201d on an iPad or iPhone that\u2019s been updated to iOS 9. This feature will be turned on by default after the update.\u00a0What it does is\u00a0automatically switch you over to a mobile data connection once the device\u00a0detects that a Wi-Fi connection is poor or weakening. So, for example, when you leave an area with Wi-Fi \u2014 like your home or office or that coffeeshop with the crummy coffee but fibre internet \u2014 you\u2019ll see your device trying to cling to the connection until the last possible moment. This feature is meant to get around that by letting you immediately shift to mobile data. \n \nThe problem is, almost all of us are on limited data plans. Whether it\u2019s buying a GB or two of data each month on prepaid, a monthly allowance on a\u00a0contract \u00a0\u2014 which, once depleted, can result in eye-watering out-of-bundle data rates \u2014 or a combination of the two with top-up accounts, we simply can\u2019t afford to use mobile data the same way we use Wi-Fi. \n \nHell, most of us have changed our behaviour accordingly, limiting things like updates to times when we\u2019re in Wi-Fi range. So turn off \u201cWi-Fi Assist\u201d and remind your device it\u2019s not in South Korea, and neither are you. \n \nThe post appeared first on Stuff .", "source": "Stuff.co.za"}
