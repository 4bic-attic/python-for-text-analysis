I was going to participate in a  conference in Morocco with the Arab sports leaders association and [another  conference] in Sharm el-Sheikh. I have conferences that I want to attend in  October in Bahrain and Morocco, the conference for female Arab sports reporters,  but until now I don\u2019t know if I will be able to get out of Gaza or not,\u2019\u2019 she  said. \n\nAs a member of the West Asian Athletics Association media committee  and vice president of the women\u2019s sports committee in the Palestinian Olympic  Committee, Masri is making strides in her field. \n\nAnd according to her  father she\u2019s a role model for other women wanting to follow in her  footsteps. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me as an athlete and as a modern man who  lived the experience to encourage a role for woman in society. The woman should  pave her way in society as she likes it and it\u2019s in line with her  hobbies. \n\nI support women to be a part of society. We are a Muslim and  modern society that understands the traditions of our country and homeland,\u2019\u2019  said Ismael al-Masri. \n\nA blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt means  residents cannot import many basic construction materials to rebuild, as they  can be used to build weapons and attack tunnels. Israel no longer gives work  permits to Gazans, and only a tiny few ever receive permission to set foot out  of the increasingly impoverished enclave, the rest confined indefinitely to an  area less than half the size of New York City. \n\nAccording to the World  Bank, Gaza now has the world\u2019s worst-performing economy, with the world\u2019s  highest unemployment at 43 percent, 68 percent among those aged 20-24. Since  1994, real per capita income has fallen by nearly a third. Manufacturing \u2013 once  the hoped-for backbone of an economic revival \u2013 has shriveled by 60  percent. \n\nBut despite the setbacks, Masri remains committed to covering  stories beyond the Gaza border.", "source": "Jerusalem Post"}
