Donald Stephenson will start at left tackle. \n\nThe rest of the starting offensive line: Ben Grubbs at left guard, Mitch Morse at center and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif at right guard. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play the five best, and Fish gives us a whole lot of flexibility, he can play any position on the offensive line, and play at Pro Bowl caliber,\u201d Reid said. \n\nFisher, the NFL\u2019s overall top selection in 2013, returns to the position he played as a rookie. Asked if it was disappointing that Fisher didn\u2019t remain on the left side, Reid didn\u2019t bite. \n\n\u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201d Reid said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that.\u201d \n\nWith Fisher\u2019s injury, Stephenson had played left tackle throughout the preseason. \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s just leave him there, it looks like he\u2019s comfortable with that,\u2019 \u201d Reid said. \u201cHe was more comfortable there than at right tackle. He had some ups and downs at that right tackle spot.\u201d \n\nReid said the offensive line was constructed in groups by pairing Fisher with second-year pro Duvernay-Tardif, who will make his NFL debut on Sunday, and the two-time Pro Bowler Grubbs with Stevenson, who has 14 career starts. \n\n\u201cThe way it sets up, it works out perfectly,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI think Grubbs is tremendous for Donald and Fish is tremendous for (Duvernay-Tardif). It\u2019s a good match there. \n\n\u201cFish knows the offense backwards and forward, Fish had it down, he\u2019s a very smart kid this is his third year playing, and that\u2019s great for Larry. \n\nGrubbs and Donald kind of hit it off. I like that chemistry there.\u201d \n\nFisher injured his ankle and projected starting right guard Jeff Allen suffered a sprained knee. Neither played after the preseason opener. That\u2019s when Stevenson moved to left tackle and Duvernay-Tardif started at right guard. \n\nThe starting offensive line had early struggles in the second preseason game, against the Seattle Seahawks, but played better in the third game against the Tennessee Titans. The starters didn\u2019t see the field in the fourth preseason game, at St. Louis on Thursday. \n\nStevenson started three games at right tackle and four at left tackle in 2013 and worked at left tackle during the team\u2019s organized activities in the spring. Reid said at the time he was just giving Stephenson reps there to help develop is versatility. \n\nBut Reid said Monday the left side is a better fit for Stephenson, who played at Blue Springs High and Oklahoma. \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more comfortable on the left side than the right side,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI thought Fish was having a phenomenal camp on the left side. This was something I had to think through. But with Fish\u2019s injury, Donald gets in there and it became very evident he was more comfortable on that side than on the right side.\u201d \n\nVersatility was a buzzword for Reid and general manager John Dorsey when discussing the offensive line. \n\nThe Chiefs moved Zach Fulton, who started at right guard last season, to center against the Rams. Fulton had never played the position in an organized game but by all accounts held his own. \n\nThe signing of tackle Jah Reid, cut by the Ravens on Saturday, also supports the Chiefs needs to be flexible. \n\n\u201cHe can play all four sports, not center, both tackles, both guards,\u201d Dorsey said. \n\nThey\u2019re about to face a Texans defense that features reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt, but Reid likes what the Chiefs will present. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with this group right now,\u201d he said.", "source": "KansasCity.com"}
