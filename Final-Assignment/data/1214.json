The Ivory Coast international sprung the offside trap and lashed a\u00a0strike into the bottom-left corner. \n \nAnd there was to be one final twist in the tale, which came as Lukaku latched on to another fine Deulofeu delivery, following up a heavy first touch by squeaking the ball in at the near post to complete an impressive fightback.", "source": "SoccerWay.com"}
