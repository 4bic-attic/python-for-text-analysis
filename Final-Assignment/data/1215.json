The geographical area we cover is very diverse which brings with it lots of different challenges but also lots of different opportunities. \n\n\"At any one time, we will have somewhere between 15 and 20 developments at various stages of the process and the location of the developments we have in the pipeline make this a very exciting time for everyone involved in Persimmon North London. \n\n\"My main aim in the region is to oversee the development of high quality houses at affordable prices, predominately targeted at first-time buyers or people who are moving up the property ladder for the first time.\" \n\nMr Watson also confirmed that Persimmon Homes North London is set to provide a further boost to the local economy by generating more jobs.", "source": "Luton & Dunstable Express"}
