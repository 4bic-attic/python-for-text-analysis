It's ..yeah, deceiving. So the phone itself is still whatever it is... $700, I think? It's on a 2-yr term so... I don't know how to do the math >.< harrrrrrrr~~~\n___________________________________\n@ 9PM\nMy phone is HERE! [but I miss the small size of my LG pop...]\nWhite > Gold (the one that CT has, in my opinion) My brother & I actually went to the KG mall location, but they said they didn't have this phone in store... the closest location with the phone was CC so we drove there. Bro found parking & paid for the parking... Got the phone & had the employee there set it up briefly to make sure it's running. & now, I'm just playing around with it... Need to add my contacts on it -.-\" my old phone is too old so I can't \"sync\" or Bluetooth my entire contacts list over =( thus gotta do it manually. That's how oldddddddd my Pop is!\n& now, I am... playing around with my new toy =P\nSept11th: The anniversary of me getting my new phone = 1st smartphone ever.", "source": "A Beautiful Reason"}
