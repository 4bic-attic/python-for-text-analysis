As a multigenerational firm, Monheit Frisch Group PLC brings decades of experience, stability and wisdom to its clients, providing advice, insight and planning. \n\n\"We take the time to fully explain your options and the logic behind our recommendations,\" said David Monheit, a partner at Monheit Frisch Group . \"Many people who manage their own financial matters use multiple advisors; one for tax and accounting and another for investments and insurance solutions. Our approach is different. We work as a holistic firm that focuses on performing as your personal Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  We believe this approach provides the best platform to increase the chances of attaining your personal and family financial goals.\" \n   \nThe company's responsibility as a client's CFO is to know one's family, personal situation and all investment objectives, and to keep their clients on track toward their present and future goals, always carefully determining how financial decisions will impact taxes, financial and estate plans. \n\n\"When your tax and wealth management come from one command center (your personal CFO) and a team of professionals working toward your vision, you are potentially much closer to improving your after-tax income, reducing your exposure to estate tax, and realizing your financial and lifestyle goals,\" said partner Gary Frisch. \n\nAbout Monheit Frisch Group PLC \nMonheit Frisch Group PLC was originally established in 1972 as a sole-proprietor individual, estate, trust and small-business tax preparation and consulting firm.
