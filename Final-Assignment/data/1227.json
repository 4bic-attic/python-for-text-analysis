Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer\u2019s interests come together in the club\u2019s Posters by the People program. Through Posters by the People, Hanauer\u2019s able to take an idea of the Galaxy\u2019s and make it better, as well as mixing two passions in art and sport. \n \nRoger Levesque\u2019s putting that Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration to good use. In his first season as Sounders FC Director of Community Outreach, Levesque is organizing Seattle\u2019s 30 in 30 campaign. This month, United in Green (Sounders FC\u2019s community arm) is working with the First Team, S2 and former players to provide 30 inspirational experiences to kids and families battling cancer in 30 days. \n \nThe Reign continued their exceptional season with a hard-fought 2-1 win over the Washington Spirit, a preview of the #1 v #4 playoff matchup to come (Sunday 6:30pm at Memorial Stadium,) the exact same first round matchup as last year.\u00a0 Notable in the game was some drama from the sideline , as Seattle owner Bill Predmore was at the Reign bench despite it being explicitly against the NWSL rules for him to be there, refusing to leave when asked to do so and reportedly throwing an organizing volunteer\u2019s phone as a part of the scene. \n MLS  \nIn case you somehow missed it, Drogba\u2019s here and debuted in dramatic fashion, simultaneously ending Chicago\u2019s season while keeping Montreal\u2019s alive ,\u00a0scoring a hat trick on his debut, including the equalizer and game-winner within 5 minutes. A particularly bitter end for Chicago, who after missing out on Jermaine Jones last year now will likely watch another transfer target help another Conference rival into the playoffs. Fire fans can only hope that the reported 300k in TAM/GAM they received from the Impact will be invested into quality defenders (not JKH or Ianni) soon, as their attack seems to be rounding into MLS 3.0 form with Mike Magee, David Accam, Harry Shipp, Patrick Nyarko, Gilberto, and Kennedy Igboananike. \n \nKevin Ellis has quite a unique background story , featuring an unknown father, a twin brother\u2019s sacrifice, overcoming his mother\u2019s death, leaving college to pursue pro soccer, and an overwhelming love of the game. \n USA  \n\"Maybe, just maybe, when someone like [NASL Commissioner] Bill Peterson talks about promotion and relegation, the real question isn't 'why or why not can we have promotion and relegation in America,' but\u00a0 'who killed it?'\" \n \nOnce Upon a Metro has a piece up on the Freedom of Information Act and complaints filed in the past 3 years in soccer- Sounders fans might remember (and possibly reported) the first complaint, Colin Clark\u2019s well-publicized homophobic slur that earned him a three-game suspension in 2012. Also an interesting examination of supporters\u2019 chants and their use of profanity on broadcasts. \n \nUnivision\u2019s version of SportsCenter, Contacto Deportivo, surpassed ESPN\u2019s flagship program in viewership in July and August by 42% (that\u2019s a lot), winning specifically in the key Adults 18-49 demographic, regardless of language. \n \nNWSL attendance is up 23% from last year, enjoying the bump from this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup.\u00a0 There is cause for optimism outside the bump , however, with\u00a0eight of nine\u00a0teams reporting an 10% increase or more, and all teams are expected to return next season. In its third incarnation this millennium, US women\u2019s professional soccer looks like it will reach Year\u00a0Four for the first time. \n World  \nDavid Beckham thinks he can act in more than just underwear. Regardless of whether or not he can, casting the former England star as 007 would sure sell a whole lot of tickets (and possibly ruin the Bond franchise for decades.) To be fair to Beckham, he sounds humble enough about slowly working towards larger acting roles. \n \nManchester United\u2019s transfer policy has them at a crossroads of development. Huge spending sprees are becoming the preferred mode of \u2018Win Now\u2019 as Homegrown Players fall prey to overhype and inconsistent playing time. \n \nRumors that Oriol Rosell could be returning to Sporting Kansas City soon , as the midfield at Sporting CP has gotten crowded for the 23-year-old. Rosell would be a solid player returning to MLS, though he would have to go through allocation due to the transfer fee SKC received; LA currently sits atop the allocation order. Perhaps this is a preview of the process Fredy Montero will have to go through if/when he decides to return to MLS/Seattle.", "source": "SB Nation"}
