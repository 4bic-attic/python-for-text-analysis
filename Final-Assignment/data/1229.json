They hired me off Twitter. AND they put in the contract that I have to keep my shirt on,' he added.\u00a0\u00a0 \n   \nFashion faux pas? Despite his unique sense of style and outspoken views about the industry, The Fat Jew has become one of NYFW's most unlikely front row stars \n   \nFamous friends: The social media star has proved a hit with many Hollywood A-listers, including Justin Bieber (pictured) \n\nHe confessed, however, that he was tempted to show off his 'Shrek body', since 'it takes a lot of work to look this s****y'.\u00a0 \n\nThe New York-based entertainer, who shot to fame in 2014 after gaining five million Instagram followers in a matter of months, went on to say that sometimes it is all about the paycheck. \n\n'I wish it was a quinceanera, so if you\u2019re having a quinceanera, please hire me,' he added. 'I will literally do whatever you want.' \n\nOn that note, he said that in lieu of tiny canapes, his show will feature hoagies and Hotel California on repeat. \u00a0 \n   \nComedy: Ostrovsky's quirky - and occasionally controversial - breed of humor has made him a huge success on social media \n\nIn the past, the self-described 'Z-list celebrity' has worked on the E!
