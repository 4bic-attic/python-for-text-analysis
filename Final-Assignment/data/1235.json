Posted Sep 18, 2015 SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL I remember sitting by her side, tears running down my cheeks, as her doctor returned her to me.\u00a0 He had just given her the medication that would within minutes quietly take her from us, allowing her to pass away peacefully.\u00a0 I loved her, and my heart ached, but I knew that this was best for her.\u00a0 That the loss of her eyesight, her failing liver, her difficulty breathing as the fluid collected in her abdomen and lungs, her painful arthritic hips, all had finally made living much less appealing than dying surrounded by loved ones.\u00a0 We were her family and owed it to her to help her die.\u00a0 Because she couldn\u2019t make the decision for herself.\u00a0 And so I had forced myself to abandon all of the selfish reasons I had been using for months to avoid arriving at this day, and I did what I knew she would want me to do. Euthanizing my dog, who my then-fianc\u00e9e and I had adopted from the shelter when she was only nine weeks old, who had been part of our new life together, who had eagerly waited for us to bring each of our newborn daughters home, who had played and slept with us for close to two decades, was the right thing to do.\u00a0 Loving pet owners euthanize their furry family members every day, to no outcry and with popular understanding and support. Last week, the California legislature sent their governor a bill which seeks to make the Golden State the 5th in the country to legalize \u201cassisted suicide\u201d (following Oregon, Montana, Washington, and Vermont).\u00a0 For many physicians like myself who have had the privilege of caring for terminally ill patients and their families, that such legislation has not passed in all fifty states is tragic.\u00a0 To address credible concerns of misuse and abuse, there are numerous checks and balances built into these laws (such as the California bill\u2019s requirements that two physicians independently agree that the patient has no more than six months to live, and that the patient himself or herself be able to swallow the fatal medications unassisted).\u00a0 Not to mention the ultimate check against misuse:\u00a0 that the patient must be deemed mentally competent to actively request assistance in life termination. Yet it is this final requirement of mental competency which is so unfortunate and unfair to thousands of terminally ill patients and their loved ones.\u00a0 I speak from deeply personal experience.\u00a0 My father, once a bright, warm, and gentle loving dad, husband, physician, and educator, has suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease for close to two decades.\u00a0 Ultimately, his Alzheimer\u2019s made living independently with my mother (with my family down the street) unsafe and impossible, and so he has been in an Assisted Living Dementia Unit for seven years.\u00a0 Over the last two years, his condition has deteriorated dramatically, and today, Dad lies in bed 24/7, communicating with no one and entirely expressionless, other than the automatic smile he now rarely displays if awake when my mom comes in the room (as she does several times a day).\u00a0 He otherwise is entirely non-interactive, sitting stiff and staring at the ceiling with glazed eyes.\u00a0 He is fed, washed, and toileted by nurses. My father has, in reality, already died.\u00a0 But he has left his skin-and-flesh shell behind, a shell which will ultimately stop breathing and no longer generate a heartbeat as a direct result of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (an estimated half-a-million Americans die from Alzheimer\u2019s every year).\u00a0 But for our family, and especially for my mother (his wife of more than fifty years), the lingering of Dad\u2019s soul-less body day after day, week after week, and now year after year, is a painful, punishing, insult to the memory of my father. \u00a0And it represents exactly what my dad, once a passionate physician and beloved teacher (as well as loving father and grandfather) clearly told his wife and family he did not wish to ever be allowed to happen.\u00a0 Long before his Alzheimer\u2019s set in, he and Mom on several occasions discussed such a potential future (as Alzheimer\u2019s runs in his side of the family).\u00a0 He articulated that should he become mentally and physically dysfunctional (conditions which he met almost two years ago), he wished for her to help him end his life with dignity.\u00a0 Now at 84 years of age, if he was suffering from advanced stage cancer, heart disease, or other terminal condition which did not alter his mental status, my father (a California resident) could (assuming the governor signs the bill) opt to end his suffering through legalized assisted suicide.\u00a0 But despite the fact that hospice professionals are now certain that Dad will pass away in the next six months, because his terminal disease will kill him through progressive brain damage, which has robbed him of his mental competency (as well as his ability to physically function), he cannot take advantage of the California legislature\u2019s recent show of legislative compassion and end an existence which he desperately wished to avoid.\u00a0 End the endless misery suffered by my mom, his wife, who must witness the spiritless shell which has now replaced her life partner, devoid of all personality, soul, life.\u00a0 And her guilt at not being able to fulfill his last wish, that he not linger on like this day after day, week after week, year after year, overwhelms her. \u00a0Her attorney and Dad\u2019s Assisted Living team have assured her that despite her having his Medical Power of Attorney, there\u2019s nothing that can be done.\u00a0 More than five million Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is the most common but only just one form of dementia.\u00a0 And the Alzheimer\u2019s population is growing dramatically as our population (and that of the world) ages.\u00a0 Assisted suicide legislation is a good start to accepting the responsibility of a compassionate and honest society in dealing with end-of-life issues, and such legalization represents the right option to offer Americans throughout this great nation.\u00a0 However, it is not too early to recognize the need to expand the opportunity for Americans nearing the end of their lives to choose a dignified, peaceful exit from this world in the presence of their loved ones.\u00a0 Thousands of once mentally competent husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters whose terminal illnesses through no fault of their own compromise their mental faculties should not have to suffer the indignity of punishing their family and friends through slow, tortuous death spirals.\u00a0 Surely we can expand legalized assisted suicide to allow any and all of us to clearly define under what circumstances we wish to be eased from our pain if no longer mentally competent to make such a decision.\u00a0 Checks and balances can be built in at the time that a mentally competent person requests the option for assisted suicide should they lose their mental competency in the future.\u00a0 And we must trust in those who love the patient to act in their best interest in accordance with the patient\u2019s previously defined guidance. After all, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our beloved dogs and cats. \u00a0How can it not be the right thing to offer our dads and moms?
