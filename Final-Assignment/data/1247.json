The software can be implemented on IBM Power Systems running IBM i, AIX or Linux, without disrupting existing IT systems or applications and requires no specialist development skills. With Columbus, IBM i users can have new digital initiatives up and running in a matter of weeks. \n \n\u201cMany enterprises find adapting core business applications to work with new digital channels highly complex and time consuming,\u201d said Jim Fisher, SoftLanding Operations Manager. \u201cThrough Columbus, we now offer a simpler, more cost-effective approach that involves no changes to your IT systems or IBM i applications. The software transforms your existing output \u2013 including spool and data files \u2013 into new, enhanced digital formats to support initiatives such as eInvoicing and customer self-service, without impacting on existing operations.\u201d \n \nColumbus is a system that takes output from existing applications, automatically transforms it into new digital formats \u2013 with the ability to enhance the look of newly formatted documents \u2013 and presents it within an in-built online portal. The portal permits secure web and mobile access for an organization\u2019s internal staff, customers and business partners. \n \n\u201cUsing Columbus, you can web enable existing invoices, statements and delivery notes for eInvoicing, for example, without having to overhaul the existing IBM i finance applications,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cTo improve customer service, a wide range of customer documents can be made accessible online \u2013 both to internal staff, and externally to support customer self-service. Business reports and ERP documents can also be turned into new digital formats, allowing wider access to enterprise information both to improve collaboration and to help streamline processes.\u201d \n \nVisitors to the International i-Power Conference (in the UK on 9-10 September 2015) will be able to see demonstrations of the Columbus software on the SoftLanding Systems stand. \n \nMore information about Columbus for IBM i users can be found on the SoftLanding website. \n \nSoftLanding\u2019s IBM i products and solutions are commercially available through UNICOM Global\u2019s UNICOM Systems and Macro 4 divisions.
