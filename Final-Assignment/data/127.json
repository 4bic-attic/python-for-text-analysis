He was expected to be ready for the start of the 2015 season before the setback, and Coughlin provided very few updates on Cruz\u2019s status prior to Friday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s improving and we\u2019re hoping,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cHe\u2019s running. He\u2019ll be running all weekend, and we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019s nothing but straight ahead positives in all his activities, and we\u2019ll see next wee", "source": "Yardbarker: NFL"}
