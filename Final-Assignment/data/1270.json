But earlier this week, a student proved that iPhones are just as capable when it comes to taking a bullet. \n \nWhile walking back to his apartment, a Californian student was shot by a robber, only to have the bullet blocked by an iPhone 5 . \n \nFresno Police say the man was approached from behind after almost reaching his front door at Campus Edge Apartments. After failing to understand the robber\u2019s demands, the victim was shot at by a black semi-automatic handgun. \n \nWhile the thief ran off with a silver HP laptop, the bullet was miraculously stopped by an iPhone 5 tucked away in the victim\u2019s pockets. While the student was unscathed in the incident, images published by Fresno Bee show the extent of the damage caused to the phone. \n \n\n \nThe suspect is 5\u201d10, and was wearing a dark ski mask, a black sweatshirt and dark pants. Anyone with information is urged to contact Fresno Police immediately on +1 559-621-7000. \n \nSource: Fresno Bee via CNET", "source": "Neowin.net"}
