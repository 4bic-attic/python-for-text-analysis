It is Yingli's largest solar panel supply agreement to date in China . \n\nAccording to the agreement, Yingli will deliver over 650,000 multicrystalline YGE Series solar panels to CFC Construction during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015. The panels will be installed in power plants located in the city of Zhangjiakou, one of Hebei province's largest municipalities. Once operational, the panels are expected to generate more than 200,000 megawatt-hours of clean energy, offsetting approximately 120,000 tons of carbon emissions. \n   \nZhangjiakou is an ideal location for the development of solar power plants due to its abundant solar resources, large industrial base, and high demand for electricity, so it was selected by China's State Council to be the site of the country's first renewable energy pilot zone. Zhangjiakou also recently won the rights to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games together with Beijing , and these new solar power plants will help provide clean solar power for a green, low-carbon Olympics. \n\n\"CFC Construction is committed to the construction, operation, maintenance and innovation of solar and wind power plants. To ensure our power plants' high quality, we only select leading manufacturers for both solar panels and balance-of-system components.
