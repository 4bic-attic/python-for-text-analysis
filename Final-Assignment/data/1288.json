Nicole///////\nNicole, YOU SAID the Lutheran church was named BY HIM.....IT WAS NOT. Also He did not leave, he was excommunicated......two entirely different matters. Do you think Martin Luther was the ONLY person who questioned the evil the RCC had become? Hardly Nicole. Luther wanted CHANGE within the RCC, and rightly so. The RCC became wealthy off the backs of peasants, and corruption within, even to today as we see Pope Francis is still cleaning CORRUPTION out of the RCC. Makes me wonder what would have been the outcome if Pope Francis was Pope at the time of Luther. ---kathr4453 on 9/20/15 Nicole, we also know the RCC in these past years have had a mass exodus because of the evil of pedophiles the Church was covering up and even protecting. EGO again has nothing to do with calling evil evil. It's called CONSCIENCE. It's called righteousness, it's called TRUTH. The history of the Borgas is also well known. Telling poor souls they can PAY for the deceased in pergetory is pure corruption. BUT the RCC needed money to buy back property lost in a poker game and came up with that. You hate that Luther EXPOSED all this corruption? And 99 in all. Because of the reformation the RCC was forced to clean their own house, but ONLY AFTER their corruption was exposed. You should be thanking Martin Luther. ---kathr453 on 9/20/15 1 Peter 1:18-19\n18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers,\n19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:\nWe see Nicole that SCRIPTURE Clearly shows one cannot buy another's soul out of a fictitious place. Listen carefully to YOUR so called first Pope. ---kathr445 on 9/20/15 Cluny said, \"I've tried several times.

Change the context and subject of the conversation? Just say, OK I was wrong. But no Nicloe you can't do that can you. You had to instead spew all sorts of hate and put YOUR twist on it insisting now his EGO really liked it, AND that he had the power to stop the RCC from naming those they called heretics after the heretic. This is why it's hard to debate with you Nicole, because when you are shown the truth, you can't just accept it at face value. YOU have to LIE and TWIST the truth to somehow insist YOU were right all along. But worse yet is your obvious HATRED of Luther. Were you there Nicole? Isn't the truth Luther was excommunicated? ---kathr4453 on 9/19/15 Luther through reading scripture had an awakening of CONSCIENCES, after reading Romans ( proving the Word of God is LIVING AND POWERFUL AND STRONGER THAN A TWO EDGE SWORD) again proving scripture that those who SEEK will find the truth. There is a difference between SEEKERS, and those who just follow and believe what they are told. Luther never insisted others follow him, but gave others the same opportunity of being able to read the Bible for themselves, where FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. Not hearing the word of man. You can't LEGALIZE FAITH. If perchance you understood that Nicole, you would be a seeker and not a follower. ---kathr453 on 9/19/15 Nicole you proved your point that Luther and the Lutheran church.\nBut he followed the Teachings of Paul and left the traditions of men. He supported following the Bible and using it as the final rule of what is doctrine. Paul and Jesus fought against traditions that Jewish leaders had built up instead of following the law of GOD. Mark 7:7-11\nHowbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\nFor laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,...\nAnd he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\nFor Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:.... ---Samuelbb7 on 9/19/15 kathr, Common sense tears your statements to pieces. A RC Priest decides leave THE RCC, and changes the traditions Paul told us to hold to them.\nThe hardest part is tell people to believe in him so much they are banking on their enteral life.\nThey followed him even after being excommunicated.\nMather Luther HAD that much POWER over the people to leave what is known to an unknown on his belief system.\nBut you want me to believe He COULDN'T STOP THEM FROM NAMING THE NEW CHURCH AFTER HIM??????? REALLY?? THE egoistic was smiling ear to ear.\nBecause a MAN who can convince you to leave your core faith, CAN tell you to remove my name from the Church. Didn't happen because he like it named after him. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/18/15 \\\\Certainly wouldn't want to enlighten him would you.\\\\\nI've tried several times.

Actually Wycliffe was never RCC in the first place was he? What about Hess, again never RCC and long before Luther. The RCC HATED Wycliffe.

It looks to him as it's founder and he is alsco called the leader of the Reformation and Protestantism. So while your point is true. I consider it nitpicking.

Luther never founded a church, and never left the RCC. But yes, your right, because of that we have churches built upon MAN. I'm of Calvin, I'm of Luther, I'm of Wesley, I'm of Apollo, I'm of Polycarp. And to have Polycarp interpretation of scripture held up as THE AUTHORITY of scripture, is insulting. Even in Paul's day it was common, he describes as carnality. But the RCC's answer is even worse. Paul never insisted on one man, or any man, the Pope, heading the church either.

Tradition does not mean the number of beads on a rosary, or the vestments a priest wears, etc. Tradition does mean the things that have come down through the ages, like the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, and the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom\nAlso, Tradition means fasting, prayer, almsgiving, feeding the hungry, giving water to the thirsty, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and those in jail.\nAll these things are the traditions that we place on the same level as Scripture, not above.\nPray for me,\nthe unworthy monk Brendan ---Monk_Brendan on 9/13/15 He took the OT with him?.---micha9344\nFriend, Jewish people don't like you to call the Torah the OT.\nBecause the OT and NT makes up the Bible which means Testifying about who?

But they don't agree with each other. Both place traditions above scripture in their understanding of doctrine.\nBoth have changed and modified their doctrine and it is recorded in history. So why should not the true Reformers go back to the original documents and use them as the foundation of their church. True people don't agree but them humans are not always agreeable.

As to the RCC, She has reformed Herself as Jesus instructed Her. Name one Church started by the famous 5 Reformers that is one, strong and GROWING today? ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/11/15 Brendan you asked, \"Is REFORMED Theology Reformed Catholicism?\"\n1. The reformation means to go back to that which was (from the beginning)\n2. Catholicism means universal (referring to church)\n3. The reformers wanted to reform the rcc, but realize it was impossible which led to ways to return to the beginning.\n4. Reform Theology is built on the 5 Solas (Scripture Alone, Grace Alone, Christ Alone, Faith Alone, and for the glory of God Alone.)\n---john9346 on 9/10/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Health Treatments", "source": "Christian Blogs"}
