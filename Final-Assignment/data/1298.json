World War II officially ended on\u00a0Sept. 2, 1945, although Russia celebrates its Victory Day on\u00a0May 9, to\u00a0mark the\u00a0end of\u00a0the war in\u00a0Europe. \n \nThe\u00a0images show prisoners playing musical instruments and\u00a0board games, eating at\u00a0a mess hall and\u00a0posing for\u00a0a group photo. \n \nHistorian Andrei Samokhin said that prisoners of\u00a0war enjoyed better living conditions than even Russian civilians, even though the\u00a0work was hard, and\u00a0the food was unfamiliar to\u00a0the Asian palate, Dozhd reported. \n \n\"The Japanese prisoners ate the\u00a0same way as the\u00a0soldiers of\u00a0the Red Army; their living conditions were based on\u00a0the same standards,\" Samokhin was quoted as saying. \"Soviet civilians\u00a0\u2014 for\u00a0instance, those who worked at\u00a0factories \u2014 received smaller rations.\" \n \nVadim Karaman, another historian, concurred that \"prisoners generally received better treatment than [the Soviet Union's] own citizens\" \u2014 a\u00a0practice he said might be attributed to\u00a0the supposed plotting by\u00a0the Soviet government to\u00a0establish a\u00a0\"Japanese Socialist Republic, along the\u00a0lines of\u00a0North Korea,\" Dozhd reported. \n \nJapanese prisoners were offered classes in\u00a0the Russian language as well as studies in\u00a0Marxism and\u00a0the works of\u00a0Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Samokhin said, Dozhd reported. \n \n\"Despite the\u00a0fact that there was a\u00a0directive that banned forceful conversion to\u00a0communism, ideological work was going on\u00a0at the\u00a0camps,\" he added. \"The prisoners included those who were truly charmed by\u00a0communism: They saw how a\u00a0former peasant could become a\u00a0military officer, which was impossible in\u00a0Japan.\" \n \nBut Japanese soldier Miyamoto Tsutomu, who spent 1945-1949 in\u00a0a POW camp in\u00a0Russia's Far East, painted a\u00a0different picture in\u00a0his memoirs, according to\u00a0the report. \n \n\"I recall an\u00a0old ensign, sitting motionlessly by\u00a0the fire and\u00a0saying: 'Since they don't feed us even rice, may one go collect more firewood?'\" Tsutomu was quoted as saying. \"Or the\u00a0former middle school teacher who stole bits of\u00a0salmon during the\u00a0night from\u00a0a kitchen cauldron. Or a\u00a0former salesman at\u00a0a convenience store who got shot from\u00a0a watchtower by\u00a0a guard when he tried to\u00a0sneak into\u00a0a warehouse with food for\u00a0the Russians.\" \n \nThe\u00a0work at\u00a0the camps could be so hard that \"often even the\u00a0thought occurred: 'What if I drop the\u00a0stones and\u00a0smash my hands with them,\" Tsutomu wrote, Dozhd reported. \n \nJapan also had a\u00a0share of\u00a0communist sympathizers, some of\u00a0whom came into\u00a0the Soviet Union voluntarily, where they settled down and\u00a0started families. Some of\u00a0their most prominent descendants include Russian politician Irina Khakamada \u2014 the\u00a0daughter of\u00a0a Japanese communist who immigrated to\u00a0the Soviet Union in\u00a01939. \u00a0", "source": "Moscow Times"}
