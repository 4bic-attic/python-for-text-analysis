Germany plans to accept 800,000 refugees this year, while Britain has set up a program to allow in Syrians that has accepted just 216.\n\nLeonhard Foeger/Reuters \n\nNearly all of the migrants arrive on the EU's southern and eastern edges but press on for richer countries further north and west, creating havoc for a bloc that normally allows free movement internally but restricts it for undocumented migrants.\n\nLaszlo Balogh/Reuters \n\n\u201cWe want to go to Germany but that train in the station, maybe it goes nowhere. We heard it may go to a camp. So we will stay out here and wait,\u201d said Ysra Mardini, a 17-year-old from the Syrian capital Damascus, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt.\n\nLaszlo Balogh/Reuters \n\nThey provide for the creation of holding zones on the country\u2019s southern border with Serbia, where construction crews are completing a 3.5-metre-high fence.\n\nLaszlo Balogh/Reuters \n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban, in Brussels for talks with European leaders, said Hungarians and Europeans were \u201cfull of fear because they see that the European leaders ... are not able to control the situation.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion piece for Germany\u2019s Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung, he wrote that his country was being \u201coverrun\u201d with refugees, most of which, he noted, were Muslims, not Christians.\n\n\u201cThat is an important question, because Europe and European culture have Christian roots. Or is it not already and in itself alarming that Europe\u2019s Christian culture is barely in a position to uphold Europe\u2019s own Christian values?\u201d he asked. \n\nVirginia Mayo/Pool/Reuters \n\nGermany has begun accepting asylum claims from Syrian refugees regardless of where they entered the bloc, suspending rules which normally require them to register and remain in the first EU country they reach.\n\nBerlin's generosity has caused confusion for its neighbors, which have alternated this week between letting migrants pass through and blocking them. Hungary allowed thousands to board trains for Germany on Monday but then called a halt to the travel, leaving migrants camped in the summer heat in central Budapest.\n\nTwitter \n\nHis 5-year-old brother Galip and mother Rehan, 35, also died after their boat capsized while trying to reach the Greek island of Kos. His father, Abdullah, was found semi-conscious and taken to hospital.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s sister Teema, a resident of Vancouver, said she heard the news from another of the boy's aunts: \"She had got a call from Abdullah, and all he said was, my wife and two boys are dead,\" Teema Kurdi was quoted as saying in Canada's National Post newspaper.\n\nHannibal Hanschke/Reuters \n\nEU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expected to unveil proposals in an annual state-of-the-union address to the European parliament next week. Interior ministers hold an emergency meeting five days later.\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.", "source": "Business Insider"}
