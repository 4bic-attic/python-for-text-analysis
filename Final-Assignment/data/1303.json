And while you might be aware of the skateboarders\u00a0at Ashish, the Elizabethan-inspired\u00a0couture at Giles\u00a0and the political demonstration at Vivienne Westwood, you may not be aware of the art history crossovers that littered the designers\u2019 SS16\u00a0collections. Did you notice the similarity between Molly Goddard\u2019s\u00a0puffy party dresses and Edgar Degas\u2019 ballerinas? Or the likeness between Mary Benson\u00a0models\u2019 pearly tears and Frida Kahlo\u2019s 1944 self-portrait titled \u201cThe Broken Column\u201d? Well, the girls behind social media phenomenon @artlexachung\u00a0did and they\u2019ve given us pictures to provide the proof. London Fashion Week\u2019s art history parallels\u00a0have officially been outed.\u00a0 Check out the full series of crossovers in the gallery above, and follow @artlexachung on Instagram here\u00a0and on Tumblr here.\rFollow Ted Stansfield on Twitter here @ted_stansfield", "source": "Dazed"}
