You and K Rudd have so much in common,\" he wrote. \n\nMr Kennett later told media Mr Turnbull was opportunistic and had committed an act of \"gross disloyal extreme egotism\". \n\nHe labelled him \"without a doubt, the Kevin Rudd of the Liberal Party\". \n\n\"We must be the laughing stock to the world\u2026 to John Key in New Zealand to David Cameron in the United Kingdom\u2026,\" he said. \n\nMr Abetz said the public expected team work and team work. \n\nHe said good leaders had clear values, policy consistency and integrity. \n\n\"The flood of messages \u2026. (are) clear - keep Tony Abbott as Prime Minister and don't behave like the Labor party did,\" he said. \n\n\"Changing leaders does not win elections. \n\n\"Tony Abbott won the last election and he will win the next. \n\n\"His focus has been creating job, pursing economic growth, national security and developing the infrastructure needed for the 21st century. \n\n\"Overwhelmingly the messages of support into our office is Tony Abbott is the choice \u2026 as Prime Minister.\" \n\nThe ballot is due to take place at 9.15 pm tonight. \n\nWHAT do you think?

Nothing's changed. \n\n\"Australia needs a change of government and Labor will be up for the fight no matter who the Liberal party selects.\" \n\nTurnbull challenges Abbott: 'we need advocacy not slogans' \n\nCOMMUNICATIONS Minister Malcolm Turnbull has resigned from Cabinet and met with the Prime Minister this afternoon to request a ballot for the party leadership. \n\nJulie Bishop has also met with the Prime Minister today on the same issue. \n\nSpeaking to the media this afternoon, Mr Turnbull said he has made his decision based on the urging of \"many people over a long period of time.\" \n\n\"Now this is not a decision that anyone could take lightly. I have consulted with many, many colleagues, many Australians, many of our supporters in every walk of life,\" he said \n\n\" It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. \n\n\"Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs. \n\n\"Now we are living as Australians in the most exciting time. The big economic changes that we're living through here and around the world offer enormous challenges and enormous opportunities. \n\n\"We need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people's intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. \n\n\"We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\" \n\nMr Turnbull said if Tony Abbott led the party into the next election, Labor would be sure to win. \n\n\"We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership.\" \n\nA spill ballot will be held tomorrow. \n\nMr Abbott survived a leadership challenge in February by 61 votes to 39. \n\nEARLIER: Knives out for Abbott: \"This time they will get him\" \n\nPRIME Minister Tony Abbott will face a leadership spill before the year is out, according to news reports today, with senior Ministers claiming this time \"they will get him''. \n\nThe ABC reported it had spoken to eight ministers and six believe Mr Abbott will be challenged no matter what happens at the Canning by-election in Western Australia next Saturday. \n\n\"And this time I think they will get him,\" one minister said. \n\nA double-digit swing against the Liberal Party in Canning would fuel the unrest. \n\nBoth the News Limited Galaxy poll and the Fairfax Ipsos poll point to a 10-point swing. \n\nThe Ipsos poll has the Liberal Party leading Labor after preferences are distributed by 52 to 48 per cent - it was 62 to 38 per cent at the 2013 general election. \n\n\"And that's after we spent $1 million on that seat to save the Prime Minister, and Labor has spent nothing,\" one Cabinet minister said. \n\n\"He said: 'Give me six months.' Well, he has had six months and things have gone from bad to worse. \n\n\"He should just resign.\" \n\nFairfax reported a savage swing in friendly LNP territory in WA would be a 'political death threat to the Abbott government''. \n\nThe Abbott government has now been in a losing position in the national polls for 18 consecutive months. \n\nMPs and Ministers are increasingly saying the problem comes from the PM's office and the way in which Cabinet processes are being bypassed. \n\nMPs and senators increasingly are losing confidence in Abbott's ability to turn the situation around, Fairfax reported.", "source": "Daily News"}
