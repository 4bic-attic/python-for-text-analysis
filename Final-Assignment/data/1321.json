All the other needs of households will be covered thanks to imported gas. \n \nHe also said that not all the gas produced by public joint-stock company Ukrgazvydobuvannia goes to households, and that some gas is produced under agreements on joint operations with private companies. \n \n\"We [have for] several times proposed that the parliament and lawmakers amend the law, then there would appear a possibility of giving gas made under joint production agreements to households. This would be a kind of re-privatization. If the decision is made, Naftogaz would make it with pleasure,\" he said. \n \nIn turn, Ukrgazvydobuvannia Board Chairman Oleh Prokhorenko said that in 2015, the company could produce around 14.5 billion cubic meters of gas, including 1.2 billion cubic meters under joint production agreements, with 500 million cubic meters being required for the technical needs of the company and for the operation of gas booster stations. In 2014, around 2 billion cubic meters of gas was made under joint production agreements, he said.", "source": "Interfax-Ukraine"}
