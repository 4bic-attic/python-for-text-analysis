Chris Costantino said. \n  \nThe woman told police that she went to bed around midnight and woke up three hours later to a large crash at her front door. Costantino said her white pit bull ran toward the front door. He said she then heard another loud sound. \n  \nThe woman walked down her hallway and was approached by a black male wearing a black sweatshirt, with the hood over his head and a mask covering his face, Costantino said. The man placed a gun to her forehead and ordered her to the ground, he said. \n \n\r\r \n  \nThree others were with the man and she could hear them saying that they were the Elyria police and to get down, he said. \n  \nThe woman looked at their clothing and realized they were not police officers, Costantino said. Three of the four culprits were armed, he said. \n  \nThe suspects asked the woman where the money was, but she didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, according to Costantino. After searching the house, one of the individuals indicated he found some money and told her not to call the police or she would be hurt, Costantino said. \n  \nAt some point during the incident, he said, the dog was shot and taken for emergency medical treatment. The dog survived, Costantino said. \n  \nPolice are investigating the incident. Anyone with information on the suspects is encouraged to call the Elyria Police Department at 440-323-33", "source": "Lorain Morning Journal"}
