There\u2019s a rap interlude from Lunch Money Lewis; a sexy duet with pop star Jordin Sparks. \n\nThe artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session \u2014 too nervous, he said, to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album \u2018Tangled Up.\u2019 He strides in when it\u2019s over, bedroom eyes scanning the room for a reaction. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d the group initially declares before the question on everyone\u2019s mind gets asked. \n\nThe son of 90\u2019s country singer and Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins, Rhett made his debut in 2013 with \u2018bro\u2019 songs like \u2018Get Me Some of That\u2019 and \u2018It Goes Like This\u2019 \u2014 his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day. But in the past year, Rhett\u2019s undergone a metamorphosis: first with his BeeGees-inspired \u2018Make Me Wanna\u2019 and then with \u2018Crash & Burn,\u2019 the Sam Cooke-style debut single off a forthcoming record that marries soul, pop, disco, electronic dance music (EDM) and a dash of rap with what\u2019s typically known as country. \n\nThe single Rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising, biggest selling song. And nestled in the Country Billboard Top 10 this summer betwixt hits like Sam Hunt\u2019s party-hearty \u2018House Party\u2019 and \u2018Like a Wrecking Ball,\u2019 the soulful sex-jam from Erich Church, his risk at least feels of the moment. There is comfort in acknowledging the chart-busting success of genre-blurring acts like Florida Georgia Line (who Rhett has supported on tour), Luke Bryan and Hunt, whose nearly pure-pop and R&B debut album has made him something of a (controversial) pioneer. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating\u201d Rhett said in an interview, reflecting on his move away from \u201cbro\u201d and towards something entirely new. \u201cSomeone the other day was like \u2018Man, I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I feel like you\u2019re on the brink of leading a new direction of music. \n\n\u2019\u201d \n\nBut in the minds of traditionalists, a new direction isn\u2019t something to which a country musician should aspire. To guys like Kyle Coroneos, who runs the website SavingCountryMusic.com, country is a genre not to be tampered with. Country music is about preserving tradition. It always has been and always will be. \n\nHe calls this disco/EDM iteration a \u201cbro-hangover.\u201d The idea that bringing other genre-influences into country right now is risky, or pushing the envelope, or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous, he says. Instead, it contributes to one giant \u201cmono-genre,\u201d which he believes the merging of hip-hop and country has become. \n\n\u201cThe risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries, you begin to lose control of the music, you begin to lose control of your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cCountry music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions \u2014 no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year, not even rock or EDM or rap. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe genre-blending and trend-chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio, he said. \u201cIn the 1990s and early 2000s, rock became the catch-all phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded. I think it could happen\u201d with country music. \n\nRhett doesn\u2019t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music. \u201cWe\u2019re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble, because we\u2019re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks,\u201d said Rhett. \u201cTo me, I want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side-stage, they\u2019ll say \u2018Dang, I can\u2019t believe they just did that in their concert.\u2019 Or they hear a song on the record and go \u2018How in the world did they cut that song and get away with it?\u2019 There\u2019s something kind of rebelliously fun about it. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe cites mainstream country rebel Church as inspiration, his latest rock-influenced record \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 is stacked with successful radio hits, despite its many middle-finger-to-the-man moments. But in the minds of critics, that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of Willie & Waylon and more indicative of Nashville chasing the next biggest money-making thing. \n\nDespite all of the pop experimentation, the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes: There\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 country and there\u2019s that crap you hear on the radio. But if you\u2019re going to refer to something as \u2018real\u2019 country, you have to have a definition of what \u2018real\u2019 country is. \n\nIf Thomas Rhett wants to put out an album in the style of Bruno Mars and have EDM and R&B stuff \u2026 I am 100% for it. You go, Thomas Rhett. You do that. But don\u2019t do it and sell it to country fans \n\nCountry music\u2019s identity is very much rooted in geography \u2014 there\u2019s Texas Swing out of the Lone Star State; there\u2019s Kentucky bluegrass, there\u2019s The Bakersfield Sound in California, which was a grittier, more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of Countrypolitan Nashville. \n\nPerhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2014 the combination of blues, country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons. While Rhett\u2019s hip gyrations are the closest he\u2019ll ever get to Elvis, maybe his Bruno Mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way \u2014 reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines. \n\nAnd if there would be no rock \u2018n roll without blues, country and gospel, there would be no co\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
