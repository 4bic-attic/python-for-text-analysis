Laura Cardoso via Wikimedia Commons \n  \nBlackstone Labs is a heavy hitter in the weight-room-supplement game. The company is fronted by two social-media-savvy beefcakes who often take to YouTube to hawk and explain their company\u2019s wares. But Arizona-based Nutrition Distribution, a supplement company that competes with Blackstone, claimed in an April lawsu it (filed in California) that the Florida company was trying to pass off products as \u201cnatural supplements\u201d when they actually included \u201cillegal synthetic ingredients .\u201d \n\nNow, the legal action is heating up, with the competitor again claiming Blackstone is deceiving clients and flouting regulation. This month, lawyers asked a California judge to sign an injunction against the sale of one particular chemical that hasn\u2019t even been approved for human use \u2014 a Blackstone product called Ostapure. \n\nIn promotional material and videos featuring the company\u2019s two owners and frontmen, P.J. Braun and Aaron Singerman, the company trumpeted Ostapure\u2019s usefulness for gym rats looking to swell up. \u201cOstapure has the same anabolic effect as testosterone without any of the adverse side effects that come from its use,\u201d one of the owners says in a YouTube video. \u201cWhen using Ostapure on a diet, you don\u2019t have to worry about shrinking or flattening out while losing body fat. In fact, you\u2019ll stay strong in the gym, keep your pumps, and maintain your sex drive.\u201d \n\n[embedded content] \n\nAccording to Nutrition Distribution, though, Ostapure\u2019s active ingredient, Ostarine, hasn\u2019t been green-lit for human consumption. The drug is still going through trials, meaning \u201cThe sale of Ostarine over the counter without comprehensive evidence of its safety puts the public in significant danger,\u201d the Blackstone competitor claims in court filings. \n\nBoth Ostarine and Ostapure are prohibited for use in sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency. \u201cI was surprised to learn that Blackstone markets Ostarine as an over-the-counter steroid, promising huge muscle gains with no side effects,\u201d Dr. Feliciano Serrano, an expert witness for Nutrition Distribution, wrote in an affidavit. \u201cOstarine has many side effects that we know of, and possibly more that we are unaware of, since there have never been comprehensive safety studies on humans.\u201d \n\nOstarine is currently in phase II clinical trials conducted by its developer, Gtx Inc., for treating breast cancer and osteoporosis. \u201cThe fact that Ostarine is only in phase II trial means that there is no evidence that Ostarine is safe for humans to consume,\u201d Serrano writes in his affidavit. \u201cOstarine has many recognized potential side effects, including hepatoxicity (liver damage), and markedly lower plasma HDL cholesterol (raising the risk of heart disease). Ostarine also has less serious side effects including headaches, back pain, and diarrhea.\u201d \n\nBlackstone isn\u2019t the only place you can get your hands on Ostarine. You can also purchase the active pharmaceutical ingredient \u2013 MK-2866 Ostarine \u2013 from a website called HardcorePeptides.com . And this isn\u2019t the only heavy-duty drug you can scoop up from the website \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the stuff you\u2019d expect to only be able to get through a doctor. \n\nIn addition to Ostarine, HardcorePeptides.com sells Pramipexole , a drug used to treat Parkingson\u2019s; Ketotifen , commonly used to treat asthma; clomiphene , an estrogen receptor modulator common in fertility treatments; exemestane , a drug used to treat breast cancer; and sildenafil , known more commonly in the bedrooms of America as Viagra. \n\nThis site is able to sell these drugs apparently because it claims to be a \u201cpeptide & research chemical supply company\u201d that features products \u201csold for research purposes only.\u201d Yet in the lawsuit claims the website was yet another \u201cscheme to sell pharmaceuticals to bobybuilders\u201d linked to the Blackstone crowd. \n\nHardcorePeptides parent company \u2013 Hardcore Ventures LLC \u2013 is incorporated in Washington state. Records list an \u201cAaron Singerman\u201d as an officer of the company. Also, the lawsuit alleges that \u201cBlackstone helps funnel its bobybuilding customers to Hardcore Peptides by inputting the customer\u2019s data on Hardcore Peptides marketing listserv.\u201d The Blackstone Labs\u2019 Facebook account has also advertised sales on the Hardcore Peptides sites. \n\nThe injunction petition will be ruled on in the fall. Nutrition Distribution\u2019s attorney declined to comment on the latest filings. Blackstone Labs did not return a message left at the office last week seeking comment. Attorneys representing the company also did not reply to an email seeking comment.\u00a0", "source": "Broward Palm Beach"}
