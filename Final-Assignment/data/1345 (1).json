The Economic Policy Institute's Josh Bivens explains: \nBetween 2000 and the second quarter of 2015, the share of income generated by corporations that went to workers\u2019 wages (instead of going to capital incomes like profits) declined from 82.3 percent to 75.5 percent, as the figure shows. This 6.8 percentage-point decline in labor\u2019s share of corporate income might not seem like a lot, but if labor\u2019s share had not fallen this much, employees in the corporate sector would have $535 billion more in their paychecks today. If this amount was spread over the entire labor force (not just corporate sector employees) this would translate into a $3,770 raise for each worker. And by the way, American corporations were doing just fine back when they weren't squeezing quite so hard.", "source": "Daily Kos"}
