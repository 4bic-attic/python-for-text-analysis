The student is shown in photos looking confused and upset, and for good reason: 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed, an aspiring engineer, was proud of the clock he made out of a pencil case, and he thought his teachers would be, too.\u00a0 \"They arrested me and they told me that I committed the crime of a hoax bomb, a fake bomb,\" the freshman later explained to\u00a0 WFAA \u00a0after he was released.\u00a0 \u00a0Earlier today, police in Irving revealed that there will be no charges filed against the teen, and #IStandWithAhmed is trending on Twitter. One of the teen's biggest supporters? President Barack Obama, who tweeted: \" Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.\" Ahmed's sister set up an account on Twitter in his behalf , which has since gained nearly 40K followers in less than eight hours.", "source": "Sturgis Journal"}
