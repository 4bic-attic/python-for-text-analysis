That\u2019s all about to change with the Shout! Factory re-issues of the entire trilogy, filled with hours and hours of extras giving Spheeris a closure to her work. There were no copyright issues or finagling with bands wanting a chunk of change in their twilight years\u2014it was simply a matter of Spheeris feeling instinctively unnerved at watching her life pass before her. It was footage she couldn\u2019t handle watching. \n \nSpeaking with a very confident and still invigorated Spheeris, it was apparent she knows her arena as a filmmaker. Despite being responsible for hits such as Wayne\u2019s World , Black Sheep , and, to a lesser degree, The Little Rascals , it\u2019s the Decline films that have become her calling card and life\u2019s work. The only way to convey her enthusiasm about her upcoming visit to the Wexner Center to introduce the landmark first film is through our brief, but enlightening conversation. \n \nGrowing up around a lot of cultural shifts, during The Decline of Western Civilization , you were in your mid-30s. Were you a part of that scene? What drew you to document that particular punk scene in Los Angeles? I had been going to those punk clubs. I was definitely a part of the scene and I knew most of the people in the movie before I decided to make a movie. I was older, but I think I was still working out my childhood issues and I saw their childhood issues and decided to make a film about it. \n \nSpeaking of childhoods, I truly feel that the film shaped the way I appreciate music and what I appreciate, so that\u2019s a really good answer.  Good. That\u2019s good to hear. \n \nI guess the same question is relevant for The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years , which was made seven years later. Were you equally attracted to the metal scene in Los Angeles, or were you just playing the role of documentarian?  I\u2019ll have to be honest with you. I was going to those clubs too. I wouldn\u2019t have made that movie if I wasn\u2019t a part of that scene as well. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I was a part of that scene. \n \nYou shouldn\u2019t be ashamed. I think in a lot of ways, those first two films were blueprints for their respective scenes, or genres. Especially The Metal Years , where putting a band like London up against clips of Ozzy and Kiss posed an interesting juxtaposition. I haven\u2019t talked about this much, because with these re-releases I didn\u2019t want to watch any of it. I was forced to watch this again. I couldn\u2019t handle it. But when I look at them I see so many aspects of attitude and style and trends that are still prevalent to everyday life. When I filmed them, they were unique. \n \nJust the jargon even, the language\u2026 the word \u201cheadbanging\u201d for instance. I love the part when the audience members are explaining to you just exactly what \u201cheadbanging\u201d entailed.  Yeah. I think that was eventually a cemented part of our culture with the \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d scene in Wayne\u2019s World . At the same time, it kind of killed the authenticity of something that was once an honest part of a culture. \n \nI didn\u2019t want to even touch Wayne\u2019s World and just focus on the Decline films, but I do think that for you, Wayne\u2019s World may have been this zenith of punk and metal\u2014like your ironic raspberry towards what was then considered \u201calternative.\u201d  I think I got to do Wayne\u2019s World because of The Metal Years . There wasn\u2019t anyone else who was a director in Hollywood who knew anything about that music either way. Plus I knew Lorne Michaels. It changed my life. I kind of wished I hadn\u2019t made it only because I could have made the films I wanted to make but then I would\u2019ve been broke. But yeah, it pokes fun at a lot from my past.\u201d \n \nFor me, seeing the original Decline was a sort of cultural gauntlet. I was 13 and watching from a dubbed VHS copy. Did you have the foresight when you made it that it could be that type of landmark for that scene and that music?  Well there was a guy in Singapore the other day who asked me how the kids in the third Decline could have seen the first Decline since it wasn\u2019t available, but you just explained it. What happened was, even though it wasn\u2019t available it became an underground contraband and established it that way. \n \nIs there any kind of subculture or counter-culture that you see currently that is vital? Something that you would like to expose or document? What is IV?  The answer to that and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand, is that today everyone has a camera. I hate to say the subject matter because of that, because anyone can go and make that movie now. But somewhere deep down in the bottom of the hard drive of one of those movies is the beginning of Decline IV . I\u2019m looking forward to doing it and people are always for it. \n \nSpheeris will introduce the original Decline of Western Civilization on Friday, October 23 at the Wexner Center at 7 p.m. Parts II and III will screen on Saturday, October 25 at 2 p.m.", "source": "614columbus.com"}
