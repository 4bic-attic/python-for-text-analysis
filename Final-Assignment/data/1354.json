Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. \n\nCrush the granola \n\n1. Pour the granola into a zip-top bag, removing most of the air before sealing. \n\n2. Use a rolling pin to crush the granola until it has the consistency of breadcrumbs. Spread it onto a plate and set aside. \n\nPound out the chicken \n\n1. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover with a strip of plastic wrap \n\n2. Use a mallet to pound the chicken, starting from the center, working your way to the edge \n\n3. Pound out to about 1/4-inch thickness \n\n4. In a small bowl, combine the goat cheese and blueberries. Use a fork to crush the berries and mix them into the goat cheese until mostly smooth and well-combined. \n\n5. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper, then spread the goat cheese mixture on all but the top 1-1/2 inches of the chicken. \n\n6. Starting at the bottom, roll up the chicken into a log, ending with the edge that doesn't have any goat cheese on it. \n\n7. Melt the butter in an oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan set over medium-high heat. \n\n8. Carefully lift the chicken and dip it first into the egg wash, letting any excess drip off, and then into the granola, pressing the granola onto all sides of the chicken. \n\n9. Place the chicken in the saut\u00e9 pan and cook for 2 minutes. \n\n10. Use a wide spatula to carefully turn the chicken over, then put the pan in the oven. Bake for 7 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reads 165 degrees. \n\n11. Remove the pan from the oven and tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan for 5 minutes to allow the chicken time to rest. \n\n12. Slice and serve. \n\nFor the slaw \n\n1. Combine all of the slaw ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. \n\n2. Gently toss to combine \n\nSecond place winner, Saundra Contreras from Riverside, CA won 14 free bags of Golden Girl Granola for her delicious Chorizo Meatballs with Sweet Mole Sauce recipe using Golden Girl Granola's Chocolate Decadence flavored Granola. \n\nThird place winner, Pamela Braun from Grapevine, TX won seven free bags of Golden Girl Granola for her wonderful Pasta Shells with Prosciutto and Lemon Crunch Topping recipe using Golden Girl Granola's Home Sweet Honey flavored Granola. \n\nLaunched in 2011, Golden Girl Granola comes in seven all natural delicious head-over-heels flavors that include Bluesberry, Chocolate Decadence, Creative Cranberry, Forest Maple, Home Sweet Honey, Original and Truly Tropical.
