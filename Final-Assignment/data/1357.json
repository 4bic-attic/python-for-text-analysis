Okay, I've been using a simple plastic palette with wells for the shavings of my watersoluble crayons, and I had tried to take the pigment directly from the tips of the crayons with a wet brush. But in a video on YouTube they mentioned smooshing the pigment on an acrylic block and using that as a palette. Acrylic block - well I've got numerous empty cd-boxes.\n\nSo I had a go at it. And, yes, it can be done. You can also mix the colours this way, as you can see in the above scan of a colour chart. Here I focused on browns and colour variations with malachite green as the foundation. Malachite green in itself is a very blueish green; but adding yellow green takes away some of the blue. It is still a \"cool\" green, but can be used nicely with waterplants and such.", "source": "Ulla Hennig's Weblog"}
