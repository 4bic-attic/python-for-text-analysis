Some smaller companies already are negotiating with their lenders, dumping assets at low prices and delaying payments to vendors.  \"With eight bankruptcies already announced this year, weaker producers could live or die by the whims of capital providers,\" and banks will reduce borrowing bases by as much as 15%, according to Citi analysts, which WSJ says would dry up ~$10B of liquidity.  More distress likely is in store for many companies because the hedges they purchased as protection against low oil prices are increasingly expiring.
