So instead he held what has been called a \"public consultation\" or \"consulta\", dubbed 9-N because of its date. \n\nObservers judged it to be little more than one of a succession of impressive but ultimately purely symbolic mass protests. \n\nIts results did not reflect the mixed opinion in Catalonia, with unionists largely staying away. \n\nHowever, more than 2.3 million people voted in the action with 80 per cent of them backing independence from Spain. \n\nMr Mas former vice president Joana Ortega and Irene Rigau, his education minister, have also been summoned to court. \n\nThe investigation in to their referendum began last December.
