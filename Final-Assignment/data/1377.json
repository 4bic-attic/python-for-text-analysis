These concessions were in the business case, they were on the Council\u2019s website for months, and until very recently even the Cabinet fully believed they existed. \n \n\u201cThe \u00a375 charge Labour are levying on Harrow\u2019s residents is bad enough, but breaking promises to some of our more vulnerable residents is even more disgraceful.\u201d \n \nA consultation on the garden tax was held earlier in the year, and the council says the information on the Hatch End Association\u2019s website is from an associated document on the proposals which no longer appears online. \n \nIt also adds that the consultation added that concessionary rates were only proposed for residents on means tested benefits, meaning not all pensioners would be included. \n \nA Harrow Council spokesperson said: \"Before introducing a charge for the optional garden waste collection service we undertook a borough wide consultation about the proposals and to seek residents views about introducing a discount for residents on means tested benefits. \n \n\"Following the responses we received we will be introducing a concessionary rate of \u00a325 for households in receipt of Council Tax Support, if they wish to receive this optional service. \n \n\"This, we feel, is the fairest way to introduce this optional \u00a0service as it will extend the concessionary rate to all residents in the Borough on low incomes. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"Residents will receive further information over the coming months about the changes to the waste collection service, including the introduction of a free weekly food collection service and how residents can recycle more as a part of our campaign to be the Best London Borough for Recycling by 2017.\" \n \nThe council claim the tax will make savings of \u00a31.86 million each year based on 20 per cent of households taking up the service - the equivalent of more than 30 social workers or repairing 57,000 potholes in the borough.", "source": "Harrow Times"}
