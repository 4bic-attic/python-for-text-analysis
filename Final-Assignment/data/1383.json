There was a memorial corner near Departure Gate C. I didn't realized that before I saw this beautiful corner, but it's already been 9 years since Suvarnabhumi International Airport was launched. Back when I went to Thailand for the first time in February 2002, I landed on Don Mueang International Airport. And soon, I became a huge fan of Thailand. I've been revisiting Thailand again and again after that, and spent 335 days in total. I really love Thailand.", "source": "\u2022 Right up someone's alley \u2022"}
