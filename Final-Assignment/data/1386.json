He leads classes with local Cross Fit star Emily \"Breeze\" Ross, and takes part as well. He uses his booming voice when Ross wants participants' attention - at one recent class, there were nearly 200 taking part - and to encourage them to hold their planks as long as possible. \n \nMoss said the classes are a way to give back to the community, to encourage folks of all ages and fitness levels to get healthy or stay healthy. \n \nYet another surprising move from a receiver who made a career of confounding defensive backs on the field and confounding reporters off it. \n Randy Moss", "source": "Yahoo!
