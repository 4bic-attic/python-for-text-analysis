The line between China and Thailand will fuel economic development of Thailand and its neighboring countries. \n \nChinese cargo can also be more conveniently transferred to other parts of Asia , Africa , and Europe through Thailand , which can help the Chinese companies reduce their transport cost, he said. \n \nAccording to Yang Xiuping, secretary-general of the ASEAN-China Center, the railway will help tourism in Southeast Asia . Statistics from China Tourism Academy showed 11 million Chinese tourists travelled to Southeast Asia in 2014. The railway is expected to bring about 2 million more each year. \n \nAccording to China Railway Construction Corporation Limited , the round-trip fares from Kunming to Bangkok will be about 700 yuan , around half or one third of the airfare, and the freight fees are equivalent to one ninth of the cost by air. \n \nThe railway, running through Laos before entering Thailand , is also a blessing for Laos . \n \nKhammanh Siphanhxay, researcher with Lao Academy of Social Science , said Laos , with its underdeveloped infrastructure, is in urgent need of railroads. \n \nHowever, the line will pass through some mountainous areas in Thailand and Laos , which will add difficulties to the construction. However, he said, China has plenty of experience in building railroads in areas with more complicated terrain. \n \nSiphanhxay also said that some areas along the route are underdeveloped, so distribution of the profits will also be an important issue. \n \nThe environment will also be a concern for people living along the railway line, accordng to Siphanhxay. \n \n(c) 2015 FocusAsia Media Ltd.
