He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. \n\nIn 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years. He was considered one of baseball's top pitchers in the 1980s. \n\n\"Joaquin struggled for years with diabetes and in recent days had deteriorated a lot,\" former major league pitcher and fellow Dominican Mario Soto said, according to ESPN. \"He was hospitalized several times but always came out unscathed. However, he surrendered to the disease that consumed him completely.\" \n\nThe Cardinals paid tribute to Andujar on Twitter, saying \"He was 'One Tough Dominican' & a member of our Cardinals family. We loved him & we will miss him. RIP Joaquin Andujar\" \n\nAndujar also played for 14 years in the Dominican winter league. \n\n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the relatives of Mr. Andujar, a fierce pitcher who always gave the maximum on the mound,\" said Leonardo Matos Berrido, president of the Dominican winter baseball league.", "source": "News Channel 21"}
