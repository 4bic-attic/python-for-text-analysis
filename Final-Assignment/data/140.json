I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,\u201d Winterkorn said. \n \n\u201cWe at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused. This matter has first priority for me, personally, and for our entire board of management,\u201d Winterkorn said. \n \nChristian Stadler of Warwick Business School said there was \u201cno question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to CEO Winterkorn losing his job after all.\u201d \n \nWinterkorn, 68, has been chief executive since 2007, but clashed with other leadership earlier this year. \n \n Image damaged \n \nStefan Bratzel, director at the Center for Automotive Management, a research group, said the damage to VW\u2019s image would be as great as the financial fines. \n \nAnother leading German auto expert, Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, agreed.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cIt will be tough for VW to regain its credibility in the United States after this incident,\u201d he said. \n \nIn the US, Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell said \u201cit is in Volkswagen\u2019s best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good.\u201d \n \nGerman Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that VW would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly.\u00a0 \n \nAnd he insisted the reputation of \u201cMade in Germany\u201d technology would not be tarnished. \u2014 AFP", "source": "Malay Mail"}
