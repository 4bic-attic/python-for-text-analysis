The new eRTGCs run on electricity, which emits up to 95 per cent less exhaust and produces 45 per cent less noise than diesel-driven RTGCs. \n\nThe new eRTGCs are 1-over-6 models which increase both yard stacking capacity and container handling efficiency. HIT is committed to investing in equipment and facilities to enhance terminal productivity. \n \n Category : Maritime Greater China \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Tags", "source": "GCTL8.com"}
