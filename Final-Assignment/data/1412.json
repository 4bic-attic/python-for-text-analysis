Tolkien.\n\nThen on to\u00a0Romania...\n\n...Hungary...\n\n...and Slovakia.\n\nIt was like stepping back in time.\n\nIn some places horse-drawn carts and hay wagons were almost as common as automobiles.\n\nTravelers shared the road, no matter what their mode of conveyance.\n\nDuring\u00a0haying time in Romania...\n\n...everyone seemed to be out working in the fields with their wooden rakes and hayforks.\n\nGrandma and Grandpa too.\u00a0\nWhile shepherds watched over their sheep, as they have done since time out of mind.\n\nWe visited beautiful villages...\n\n...and cities.\n\nWe saw the ancient painted churches of Bucovina, designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nWe tried some new things...\n\n...met some new friends...\n\n...and made memories which we shall enjoy for the rest of our lives.\n\nIt's thrilling to go out into the world, but just as wonderful to come home again.\n\nWe found a treasure or two on our travels, but the best souvenirs...\n\n...are always the new friendships,\u00a0insights, and perspectives\u00a0we carry home with us.\n\n\nAll words and images c2015 Naomi Baltuck.\nClick here for more interpretations of The Weekly Photo Challenge: Connected.", "source": "Writing Between the Lines"}
