He was found in Newmarket Square t about 4am on 16 November 2013, having earlier attended the Ireland versus Latvia football match at the Aviva Stadium.\n\nThe father-of-four was taken to St James\u2019s Hospital but later transferred to Beaumont. Labour has previously said that Harte has been \u201cmaking good progress in his recovery.\n\nHarte was a hugely popular figure around Leinster House and politicians from all sides of the house offered their support and sympathies after the incident.\n\nHe joined Labour in 2010 and contested the 2011 general election in Donegal North East. He failed to win a seat, coming fourth in the three-seat constituency. Harte was subsequently elected to the Seanad Industrial and Commercial Panel in April of that year.\n\nThe resignation triggers another by-election of Oireachtas members for the vacant seat - nearly a year after Fine Gael\u2019s John McNulty debacle. A motion will be moved in the Seanad tomorrow triggering the by-election process, which takes at least six weeks.\n\nSpeaking in the house today, Fine Gael\u2019s Seanad leader Maurice Cummins paid tribute to Harte, saying he wished him and his family well.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il Seanad leader Darragh O\u2019Brien wished Harte \u201call health and happiness\u201d in his retirement, describing him as an \u201cabsolute gentlemen\u201d who would be missed.", "source": "TheJournal.ie"}
