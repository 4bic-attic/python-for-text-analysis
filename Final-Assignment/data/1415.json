They destroyed buildings, vehicles, a homemade explosives facility and more than 50 of the militants\u2019 fighting positions, it said. \nIn Syria, six strikes hit near Mar\u2019a and others at Raqqa and Tal Abyad, the statement said. \nAt least 47 fighters were killed in clashes between ISIL and rival Syrian rebels, a monitor said on Sept. 5, in an area where the United States and Turkey are planning to open a new front against ISIL. \nThe renewed fighting raged on Sept. 4 around the rebel-held town of Marea, 20 kilometers from the Turkish border, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \nThe area falls within a \u201csafe zone\u201d Turkey said last month it would set up in northern Syria to help keep ISIL at bay. \nISIL said late on Sept. 4 it had waged a fresh assault on Marea, killing \u201cdozens\u201d of Syrian rebels fighting against the group.", "source": "QatarsHub.com"}
