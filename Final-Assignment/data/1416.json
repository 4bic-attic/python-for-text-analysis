Authorities have not yet identified the woman killed.\n\nA man in mid-20s showed up a short time later at an area hospital with a gunshot wound with a gunshot to his shoulder. He is expected to survive.\n\nPolice said most eyewitnesses fled the area during the shooting. \n\n\"When you get a couple hundred people leaving a bar at one time, especially a small place like this, it is a small area. You know the neighborhood around here is really quiet, so absolutely there were people running everywhere, only so many exits out of this place,\" police spokesman Darin Snapp said.\n\nOfficers are encouraging anyone who witnessed the shooting to call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS. Investigators also hope surveillance video will give them a suspect description.", "source": "WSFA"}
