The second annual Kings Heath Street Festival, based on York Road and Heathfield Road on opposite sides of Kings Heath's A435 High Street at the Hare & Hounds junction. Words and pictures by Graham Young. \n \nThen, 6ft 3in PC Collis was a hit showing off his helmet and handcuffs to younger children. \n \nBrothers Charlie Madden, four, and Caydon Madden, five, were among the first to have their photographs taken on parental mobile phones with him. \n \nRobert Geoghegan, an artist with his own distinctive range of \u201cFunny Brummie\u201d paintings, was delighted with his early trading after also enjoying success at the Christmas craft market in Birmingham last winter. \n \n\u201cThis festival is obviously weather dependent, but today it\u2019s fantastic... especially as I do so many pictures of Moseley and Kings Heath,\u201d he said. \n \nAs for the children... for every one squealing on the big wheel, others were in a different world. \n \nA tiny girl dancing in front of The Tom Walker Trio on Heathfield Road had no idea which planet she was on while the musicians delivered a blistering mixture of rock and funk. \n \n  Graham Young   Chris Chilton with Sebastian Chilton, 20 months, and cuddly toy \"Ra! Ra!\" \n \nRaised up to shoulder level on York Road in front of the Stage Bus parked outside of the Hare & Hounds, 20-month-old Sebastian Chilton was also in another world as he touched cuddly toy \u201cRara\u201d on top of Chris Chilton\u2019s shoulders. \n \nBut, even in a human tide of street fever happiness, not every youngster was happy. \n \nAt the corner of Heathfield Road and Kings Heath\u2019s High Street, near three-year-old Ivo Short had the strangest look underneath his delightful face paints. \n \nDad Richard had the answer. \n \n  Graham Young   Ivo Short, almost three, wondering when he can have another go on the carousel ride \n \n\u201cIvo\u2019s been on the carousel and wants to go on again,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cBut there\u2019s so many children here, he\u2019s going to have to wait until after the next ride has been before he can ride again.\u201d", "source": "Birmingham Mail"}
