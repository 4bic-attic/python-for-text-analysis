We are delighted we have been recognised again for the solid work we are doing not only for our company, but for the industry at large. \n\u00a0 \nBotes continues by acknowledging the passion and drive put in by the Caxton Magazines team in very trying economic conditions. We are learning to do more with less and that has made all the difference, he adds. \n\u00a0 \nCaxton Magazines publishes Bona, Bona Man, Country Life, Essentials, Farmers Weekly, Food & Home Entertaining, SA Garden & Home, Living & Loving, People, Rooi Rose, Vrouekeur, Woman & Home and Your Family. In addition, they recently launched Bona TV as their first foray into broadcasting. \n\u00a0 \n\nCaxton Magazines has grown over the last 25 years by doing things differently. From small beginnings, they are now one of the largest publication houses in South Africa. \n\u00a0 \nFor more information, log on to www.caxtonmags.co.za and follow @caxmag on twitter for regular updates. \n\u00a0 \nIssued by: \nLumka Fihla \nAccount Manager: Havas Public Relations \nEmail\u00a0 lumka.fihla@havasww.co.za  \nWeb\u00a0 www.havasworldwide.co.za \nTel\u00a0+ 00 (27) 11\u00a0706 2693", "source": "The Marketing Site"}
