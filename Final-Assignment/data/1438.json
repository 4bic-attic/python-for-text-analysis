He had lost in four U.S. Open finals coming into this year's event, with his only win coming in 2011. \n\nIt also makes 2015 one of the best years of Djokovic's career. He won three of four major titles and was runner-up in the other, a feat he's never accomplished before.

Fed still hasn't won a Grand Slam title since 2012. (Video via\u00a0 Fox Sports ) \n\nIt was a dream final for fans. Federer and Djokovic entered the tournament as the top two seeds, and their previous meetings in majors had been loaded with drama. \n\nBut fans had to wait a while before they could see it. The match was originally scheduled to start at 4 p.m. Eastern Time, but rain pushed the start back over three hours, putting the final under the lights. \n\nDjokovic is now poised to end the year ranked No. 1 for the fourth time in his career.
