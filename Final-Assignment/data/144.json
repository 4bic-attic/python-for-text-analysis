And, after a week of pretty much everyone shouting at pretty much everyone else, that meant tough decisions for everyone. \n  \n#CBB eviction night! I can't decide who I want out! I hate/love them all! #evictionnight  #UKvsUSA \n \n\u2014 Lorraine (@lorrainemaden) September 4, 2015 \n  \nBut before we got to the eviction, we had to suffer through some more shouting. \n \nBig Brother set up a high tea, in which some of the American \u201cservants\u201d were given the task of making the British \u201croyals\u201d angry \u2013 leading to one of the most hateful segments of a TV show ever seen. \n \nWith Farrah in attendance, there was never any doubt they would succeed. She was throwing around some vile and idiotic insults at anyone and everyone \u2013 \u201cretard\u201d and \u201cgay homo\u201d were among the highlights. \n  \nFarrah overstepped the mark! Task or not! #CBB \n \n\u2014 Big Brother 24/7 (@bbuk247) September 4, 2015 \n  \nI know that Farrah is on a task, but that was too far and personal. #CBB \n \n\u2014 Foreverbbuk (@foreverbbuk) September 4, 2015 \n  \nFarrah may be on a task but I can't help but feel she's letting out her true feelings here. She is vile. There's a line. #CBB \n \n\u2014 Big Brother Superfan (@BB_Superfan) September 4, 2015 \n  \nTask or no task\u2026.. #CBBFarrah is disgusting and foul #CBB  #BBUK \n \n\u2014 Phil (@Philxxx2010) September 4, 2015 \n \nIt was horrible. Unless you were this guy. \n  \nThat was the best and funniest 5 minutes of #CBB ever  \n \n\u2014 Garry Walpole (@GJ69) September 4, 2015 \n \nThen there was a clip of Farrah being reminded of the rules about language in the diary room and apologising. And that was it. \n  \n#CBBUK so Farrah just has to say she's sorry and we're supposed to be okay about it? Fuck that homophobia is not okay & #CBB encouraged it \n \n\u2014 Molly (@__Molly) September 4, 2015 \n  \nAre you fucking serious? That's all she gets? Big Brother is only politically correct when it wants to be. #CBB  #CBBUK \n \n\u2014 J.\u03a3 (@jayeddyy) September 4, 2015 \n  \nA new all-time low #CBB  #channel5 \n \n\u2014 Tim West (@TimDWest) September 4, 2015 \n  \nCan't believe Big Brother has just promoted bullying, shut this shower of shit down #CBB  #ofcom \n \n\u2014 Nathan Le Prevost (@nathanleprevost) September 4, 2015 \n  \nwhy is homophobic abuse acceptable on C5? Would Farrah be allowed to use racist abuse and stereotypes as part of \"a task\"disgusting! #CBBUK \n \n\u2014 Gary Bardsley (@GaryBardsley) September 4, 2015 \n \nYou want a break from the vitriol? \n \nOkay, let\u2019s pause for a moment to take in the horrifying sight of Stevi and Chloe fumbling under the covers. \n  \nStevi and Chloe though #CBB  pic.twitter.com/w5Y3k7nYn5 \n \n\u2014 Captain Kidd (@kidd_kong78) September 4, 2015 \n  \nThere goes tonight's supper #Bleeuuggh  #CBB  #Stevi  #Chloe \n \n\u2014 MISSYOUSTEVIE\u2764\ufe0f\u26bd\ufe0f (@Ellabellatwits8) September 4, 2015 \n  \nNightly Stevi & Chloe make me want to vom tweet  #CBB \n \n\u2014 H.. (@Heather_1705) September 4, 2015 \n \nBut then it was eviction time, and surely it was just a case of getting the formalities out of the way, saying Farrah\u2019s name and getting her out of all of our lives for good. \n  \nAww, it's Daniel! Give him a RT to say goodbye. #CBB  pic.twitter.com/XVXUgWXPH2 \n \n\u2014 Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 4, 2015 \n \nWait, what? When you said Farrah then, it sounded a lot like Daniel. \n  \nOur Baldwin brother's time in the House is up \u2013 check out his top moments: http://t.co/gINqkSV29e  #CBB  pic.twitter.com/dlwUBo16lZ \n \n\u2014 Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 4, 2015 \n \nNo, no, no. This will never do. \n  \nNooooo why isn't Farrah out ffs #CBBUK \n \n\u2014 Hayley Whitchurch (@haywhitchurch) September 4, 2015 \n  \nI thought Farrah was a gonna! #CBB  \n \n\u2014 Tris Morris (@bigstraps) September 4, 2015 \n  \nHow the fuck is Farrah still in there??? #CBBFarrah \n \n\u2014 Owen Jones (@owen__jones__) September 4, 2015 \n  \nHow has Farrah not been evicted?! #CBBFarrah  #CBB  #getherout  \n \n\u2014 Victoria Clement (@vikiclement2) September 4, 2015 \n \nAnd how did this happen? This happened because people were voting on who should stay, rather than voting for who to evict. \n  \n#CBB clearly people have got confused with vote to stay instead of vote to leave #cbbdaniel  #CBBUK  #cbbfarrah is a tosspot \n \n\u2014 kafrin. (@stylegraduate) September 4, 2015 \n \nBut then there were also a lot of people saying things like this. \n  \nSo glad @F1abraham is still in she Sure making big brother entertaining and got the hots for james #CBBUK  #Farrah \n \n\u2014 Stephanie Thomas (@St3phani3jayn3) September 4, 2015 \n \nSo Daniel left\u2026 \n (Ian West/PA) \n\u2026and he was funny and charming in his exit interview\u2026 \n  \nAhh! Daniel is so funny, Shame we only get to see this on his eviction night #CBB \n \n\u2014 Eliza (@Elizuch1) September 4, 2015 \n \nhttps://twitter.com/__chxrll/status/639910710001201152 \n  \nDaniel's impression of Chloe is funny & accurate  \u2026He seems a nice guy, shame he's out! #CBB \n \n\u2014 Rachel S (@rach22uk) September 4, 2015 \n   \n Share article  \n    \n\u2026but he\u2019s gone.
