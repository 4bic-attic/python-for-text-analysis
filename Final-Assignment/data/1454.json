Investigating garda\u00ed said they believe some people in Temple Bar had recorded the assault on their phones. \n \nAs of last night, it was unclear if anyone with footage of the attack had come forward with the images and garda\u00ed renewed their appeal to any persons who may have witnessed the incident or were in the vicinity of Cows Lane between 8.30pm and 9 pm, or who took images of the incident, to contact them at Pearse Street Garda Station. \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
