A social media campaign that solicited signatures on a petition calling for authorities to arrest Netanyahu for war crimes pursuant to the UK\u2019s third-party war crimes law proved to be a red-herring when it ignored the legal exemption for heads of governments. Nevertheless, some view impact of more than 100,000 signatures a public relations victory and nevertheless a blow to Netanyahu and to Israel. And while demonstrators make their case behind the police barricades, Cameron is expected to apply the diplomatic heat inside when he criticizes Israeli policy of building in areas it acquired in the 1967 war that are claimed by the Palestinians and accuses his counterpart of foot-dragging on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The British government supports the separate labeling of goods originating in the post-1967 territories, a move vehemently opposed by Netanyahu, who will have his own agenda to argue with Cameron. One expected issue is the Iranian nuclear deal and the haste with which the UK re-opened its embassy in Tehran.", "source": "Media Line"}
