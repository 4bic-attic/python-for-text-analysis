Photoreceptor breakdown is a consequence of loss or damage to the RPE layer. As the disease progresses, patients may have difficulty reading and recognizing faces. \n \nThis Phase 2 study will include up to three cohorts of up to 20 subjects each. Each of the cohorts will receive one week of immune suppressive therapy prior to surgery and then different immune suppression regimens following transplantation of the cells, to determine the safety and tolerability of zero, six and 12 weeks of post-transplant systemic immune suppression. Untreated patients will receive placebo treatment similar in appearance and administration to those who have received cellular transplants. \n \nIn conjunction, the interim top-line results from the first cohort is expected in the second quarter of 2016 and the interim read-out on the second two cohorts is expected by the end of 2016, concluded the company.", "source": "Bloomberg"}
