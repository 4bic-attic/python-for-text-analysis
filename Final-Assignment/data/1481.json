The Company's resource was recently updated by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited to: \n\n\u00b7     Indicated resources of 1.14 million tonnes (\"Mt\") lithium carbonate equivalent (\"LCE\") contained in 95Mt of clay, at lithium (\"Li\") grade of 2,200 ppm \n\n\u00b7     Inferred resources of 6.3Mt LCE contained in 500 Mt of clay at a Li grade of 2,300 ppm \n\nFor further details, investors are encouraged to reference the Company's press releases dated 14 May and 27 June 2015 and/or the SRK's report that was filed on May 13, 2015 and is accessible on the Company's website. \n\nThe Sonora lithium project is comprised of the following lithium properties: La Ventana lithium concession, which is 100 percent owned by Bacanora; El Sauz and Fleur concessions, which are held by Mexilit SA de CV; and the Megalit concession, which is held by Megalit SA de CV. Mexilit and Megalit are owned 70% by Bacanora and 30%  by Rare Earth Minerals, plc.   Upon completion of the drill programme and assaying, SRK will deliver an updated resource model for mine design purposes, with an initial focus on the higher grade, open pit resources on the La Ventana and Fleur concessions. \n\nChief executive Peter Secker said: \"Drilling is progressing very positively and with a second rig about to arrive on site, we expect to complete this programme rapidly.  This campaign will form a critical component of our pre-feasibility study and it is our hope and expectation that, upon completion of drilling, we will have sufficient data to update and upgrade our resources to advance the mine design.\" \n\nAt 8:41am: (LON:BCN) Bacanora Minerals Ltd Ord Npv di share price was +4.5p at 91.5p \n\nStory provided by StockMarketWire.com", "source": "MoneyAM"}
