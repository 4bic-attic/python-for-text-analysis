Shuffle off this mortal coil.\" \n\nBlackman, of Taunton, Somerset, was convicted of murder in 2013 and lost an appeal in May last year, but his 10-year minimum term was reduced to eight years. \n\nSupporters say it was manslaughter, not murder, and have launched a campaign to review the case. \n\nAuthor and campaigner Frederick Forsyth said the court martial that convicted Blackman \"stank from top to bottom\". \n\nHis case is due to be discussed in the House of Commons later at the request of Conservative MP Richard Drax.", "source": "BBC"}
