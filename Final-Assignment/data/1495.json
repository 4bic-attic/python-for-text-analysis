It was just me and my sister that were initially going to be taking part and she didn\u2019t even own a bike. \n\n\u201cBut then, as I mentioned it more and more people, they said that they wanted to join in. The response has been heart warming. \n\nCaroline said that, during her short life, her daughter Anna was constantly there for others and remembered her as \u2018often putting their needs before her own\u2019. \n\nNow she is hoping that the bike ride will raise awareness of some of the difficult issues young people face and highlight the support that\u2019s available.She said: \u201cAnna lived her all-too-short life to the full and made lasting memories for all who knew her. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cShe lived all of her life in Ripon and there were so many people that knew and loved her. Some days it can be fine dealing with it but at other times it can be difficult. \n\n\u201cThe charities we are raising money for as so important. It\u2019s really shocked me how many people have been touched by what happened with Anna because they experienced similar problems. \n\n\u201cUnfortunately for me, other young people have been able to get through their difficult times but Anna sadly wasn\u2019t able to. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not embarrassing to admit you have a problem, you can always ask for help and let people know you\u2019re struggling. It can just be a phase you can be helped through.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nTo donate, visit https://www.justgiving.com/teams/annasangelscyclingcrew.", "source": "Wetherby News"}
