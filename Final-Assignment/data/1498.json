In 1996,\u00a0James Jordan Sr. was arrested for jumping a turnstile in New York\u2019s subway. A decade would pass without police pursuing him and in 2006, Jordan would succumb to his diabetes and died at the age of 46. It wasn\u2019t until he died that officers began looking for this\u00a0turnstile-jumping\u00a0hardened criminal,\u00a0and they did so by harassing his widow. In 2014 alone, cops would tear apart the apartment of\u00a0Karen Fennell four times as they searched for her dead husband who was wanted on a misdemeanor charge almost two decades old.\rThe repeated raids had gotten so out of hand that Fennell was forced to hang her dead husband\u2019s death certificate and funeral flyer on the front door. But still, police came into her home and turned furniture upside down looking for this deceased man. \u201cI wanted it to be the first thing they saw before they came into my home and flipped it upside down,\u201d Fennell told The Post of her morbid posting. \u201cI can\u2019t hide anyone in my apartment. It\u2019s not big enough for that. But they keep coming and insisting that he\u2019s in my house.\u201d After being harassed by countless teams of incompetent NYPD cops Fennell hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit. Last week, Fennell had enough stress of reliving her husband\u2019s death and settled with the city for $10,000. While Fennell\u2019s case may seem like a fluke, the fact is that police raid the homes of innocent people in attempts to locate suspects who do not live there, all the time. Not only do they raid the wrong house, but in some instances they even kill the innocent occupants.\u00a0 Perhaps the saddest aspect of Fennell\u2019s story is that this settlement will likely have little if any effect on the NYPD. They may very well show up at her house tomorrow.
