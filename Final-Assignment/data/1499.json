Its output has been falling as its once stellar pace of economic growth slows, leaving it with steel over-capacity estimated at around 300 million tonnes. \n\nThe country has been exporting steel at record levels as a result, a factor that has helped pushed global steel prices to their lowest in more than 10 years, with little prospect of a near term recovery. \n\nAs a case in point, the data showed global capacity utilization rates fell 3.6 per cent to 68 per cent in August - marking a decline in mills' pricing power because of their collective ability to increase output if demand recovers. \n\nElsewhere, the data also showed output in the United States, the world's third-largest producer, fell 10 per cent as mills there battle cheap imports and labour disputes, while output in India, the world's fourth-largest producer, rose 2.8 per cent. \n\nIndia, home to about a billion people and with a growing economy, is one of the few bright spots for world steel demand.\r \n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2", "source": "NDTV Profit"}
