Although the FLSA mandates employees be paid a minimum wage, the suit states Degrassi and other medical coders were or are paid based on the number of files/cases they entered into the defendant's technology system. The plaintiff contends the production rate pay doesn't amount to what they would be paid under a minimum wage. \n\nThe plaintiff also alleges she and other medical coders didn't receive overtime compensation when working more than 40 hours in a given week. She says the defendant's actions were done intentionally and willfully. \n\nDegrassi seeks unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorney fees and court costs, and other relief deemed appropriate by the court. She is represented by attorney Chris R. Miltenberger of The Law Office of Chris R. Miltenberger in Southlake. \n\nSherman Division of the Eastern District of Texas case number: 4:15-cv-00577-ALM.", "source": "The Southeast Texas Record"}
