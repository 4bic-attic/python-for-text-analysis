The Conservatives really will do anything to win \u2014 we can't let them,\" says the email.\r \n \n\r\n                            \"Stephen Harper's friends have played dirty in each of the last three elections. This one will be no exception.\"\r \n \n\r\n                            Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer and political commentator, agreed with that assessment.\r \n \n\r\n                            Employing Crosby \"shows Harper is desperate,\" Barns said in an email to The Canadian Press. \"Why? Because Crosby has one strategy only and it is scare campaigns. Appeals to insecure voters on issues like race.\"\r \n \n\r\n                            Barns predicted Crosby will try to paint NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as \"soft on migration and crime.\"\r \n \n\r\n                            Crosby could not be reached for comment.\r \n \n\r\n                            Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch, blasted the elections commissioner for \"choosing not to enforce the federal elections law by ignoring the intention and spirit of measures in the law.\" The section of the law barring foreign involvement is titled \"non-interference by foreigners\" and explicitly says a foreigner may not \"in any way\" try to influence voters, he noted.\r \n \n\r\n                            But Conservative incumbent Jacques Gourde said there's nothing unusual in hiring the services of an outside adviser.\r \n \n\r\n                            \"When we're talking about political mechanics of elections, it's international now,\" Gourde said in Victoriaville, Que., where Harper had a campaign event Friday.\r \n \n\r\n                            \"There are advisers everywhere in the world that give advice to many people. Advice is never unwelcome, and it would be applied by people in Canada.\r \n \n\r\n                            Indeed, Harper's Conservatives have been tapping the wisdom of John Howard's Australian strategists since at least 2006.\r \n \n\r\n                            Both the NDP and the Liberals have sought advice in the past from U.S. President Barack Obama's strategists.\r \n \n\r\n                            By The Canadian Press", "source": "Simcoe.com"}
