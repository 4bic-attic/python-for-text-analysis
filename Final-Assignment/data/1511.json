But a new study of the family\u2019s business in the wool trade suggests this is far from an accurate account.\n\nDavid Fallow, a former financier, has spent years studying the Shakespeare family\u2019s wealth, poring over documentary evidence from a time when \u201cwool was to the English economy what oil is to Saudi Arabia today\u201d.\n\nIt has long been assumed that Shakespeare\u2019s father was a small-town glover and dealer in hides and wool, who went from riches to rags. The new research suggests that, far from going bust, John Shakespeare was reinvesting in wool and making even more money than ever, some of it via shady deals. It was also wool, not the theatre, that prompted William to leave Stratford-upon-Avon for London in 1585, where he could act as the family\u2019s business representative.\n\nFallow analysed financial records of the time, including wool markets, the value of exports from regional ports, statistics on the rise of trade in London and industry consolidation, as well as Stratford court documents from John Shakespeare\u2019s illegal wool trading and the modest revenue generated by the theatres. Using his business acumen, he has pored over figures that he believes literary scholars have struggled to understand: \u201cYou get some very brilliant academic writing about Shakespeare. The minute they try to talk about money or numbers, it becomes almost incomprehensible.\u201d\n\nFinancial transactions and other surviving records have led him to conclude that the portrayal of John Shakespeare as a failed trader is a fable: \u201cJohn Shakespeare was a national-level wool dealer, and legal research, coupled to analysis of the wool market, proves this. The Shakespeare family never fell into poverty.\u201d\n\nHe also argues that the family\u2019s wealth could not have come just from William\u2019s theatrical activities: \u201cNobody made a fortune from theatrical seat sales alone.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Detail of a drawing of William Shakespeare\u2019s house in Stratford-Upon-Avon. Illustration: Universal History Archive/UIG via  Leading scholars Stanley Wells and Paul Edmondson of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the academic charity, are so interested in Fallow\u2019s research that they commissioned him to write a chapter for a major publication marking next year\u2019s 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death. Fallow is among 25 of the world\u2019s foremost academics and writers, including Michael Wood, Germaine Greer and Margaret Drabble, who have contributed essays to The Shakespeare Circle: An Alternative Biography, to be published by Cambridge University Press later this year.\n\nFallow, born in Glasgow, read law at Aberdeen University before working in finance for some 20 years. As senior vice-president of the US Bank in Portland, Oregon, among other posts, he specialised in structured finance \u2013 \u201cthe modern version of Shakespeare\u2019s tithes, one of the things that drew me to this research,\u201d he said. He also headed two money management companies in the US with multi-billion-dollar assets, making enough money to take early retirement aged 45, some 15 years ago. He then enrolled at Exeter University, for an MA in \u201cstaging Shakespeare\u201d followed by a doctorate on the Shakespeare family wealth, on which he is now writing a book.\n\nCommenting on his research, Wells told the Observer: \u201cHe\u2019s done a very great deal of very serious research.\u201d Edmondson addedsaid: \u201cIt explains how Shakespeare was able to afford shares in the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men [the theatrical company for which he wrote and acted]\u2026 and remarkably large purchases of land in the Stratford area.\u201d Those purchases included a house with up to 30 rooms and extensive grounds that would have required servants.\n\nJohn Shakespeare had been an alderman, regulating Stratford\u2019s affairs, when he withdrew from public life in 1576. Wells said: \u201cThe assumption has always been that he became hard up. Fallow builds a considerable argument on the idea that [he] withdrew not because he was poor, not because his fortunes declined \u2013 as has regularly been assumed \u2013 but because he had an alternative way of earning money, which was a bit shady.\u201d At a time when the selling of wool trading licences was a crucial source of Crown revenue, Fallow writes: \u201cRising prices fuelled the growth of the wool-broking business and spawned \u2026 legal, quasi-legal and downright illegal traders \u2026 Changes in markets forced a concentration of the export trade through London. To survive, the Shakespeare family business had to have a London representative.\u201d\n\nHe argues this could explain William Shakespeare\u2019s activities during the seven \u201clost\u201d years from 1585 in which he virtually disappears from the record. Seven years was the exact term of a traditional apprenticeship\n\nBut Wells takes issue with that theory: \u201cIt seems to be quite clear that Shakespeare had made a start in the theatre business several years before the end of that seven-year period.\u201d\n\nFallow also challenges the assumption that desperate finances drove John Shakespeare to sell family assets at low prices. In fact, financial records show that he was putting his property, including land, in the hands of friends and family, Fallow said. \u201cIf you look at the [sale] prices, they\u2019re all ludicrously low. In the past, people said that\u2019s because he was in a hurry. No, you\u2019re talking about a tiny fraction of what they\u2019re really worth.\u201d These sales, Fallow believes, reveal John Shakespeare\u2019s attempt to outwit the taxman.\n\nEach scholar in the Cambridge publication has examined and reconstructed the lives of those closest to Shakespeare. This is \u201can original biographical approach\u201d, said Edmondson, that has yielded exciting new insights by \u201cworking from the outside in\u201d.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2015.
