We suggest yes, but not as we know it today, and offer training as an example.\nThe notion of working globally from North East Scotland is certainly less fanciful than it would have been one or two decades ago. What is fanciful is the notion that Aberdeen can simply export Aberdeen to an eagerly waiting world that just wishes to be, well, more like Aberdeen.\nThe idea of 'internationalising' is a simple and obvious one - the tougher question is how to do it well when there are plenty of emerging providers in other regions?\nThe key would seem to be to avoid simply exporting the North Sea expertise but instead package the same skills in a more tailored way and/or offer unique bespoke products which others simply don't, or can't do so well.\nIn our world of training this is readily apparent.\nAGR's TRACS Training brand has always worked globally, and the brand distinction is the delivery of tailored courses, rather than off-the-shelf products. These take more time and effort to build and maintain than standard commodity products but they are internationally portable and no one comments on where we're based.\nAn extreme example of non-tailoring would be a training organisation known to us who designed a course based around the North Sea environment and exported it wholesale to the Middle East. The fact that the case study material embedded in the course was based on offshore projects didn't seem to phase the course designers - driven by a belief in consistency, the lack of relevance of offshore technology for desert countries was comfortably overlooked.\nThe tailored alternative of course is to drop the marine aspects. The more subtle but necessary effort is the complete deconstruction of the course to pick out the generic aspects relevant to the Middle East client group, add in the locally specific content which would not have been in the North Sea version of the course and rebuild the event around the interests of the new group.\nThis all requires effort, and goes far beyond simply cutting out the 'bits about the North Sea', but that effort is necessary to transfer the skills and knowledge of the North Sea based experts to a new domain.\nThis approach is applicable generically. It is our belief that exporting skills and experience from anywhere requires this type of approach, yet not all companies are doing it. It is easier to simply try to export the standard products and activities, and see if that works.\nThe question for each of us in our respective businesses is therefore to open up the anatomy of our skills and products - literally take them apart and consider what is special or useful about each piece. Some things we have done and learned really probably were for the North Sea only; other things are not and therein lies the value. Rather than simply package up the same products and offer them optimistically to 'interested others' elsewhere, we are required to critically think through and isolate the components which carry value internationally.\nThe result may be surprising. It may be just part of an existing product but could equally not be a product at all but rather the thoughts of the people who had the flair to the build the product in the first place.\nFor sure, it is likely to be different, and 'different' can still be based in the North East.\nThis article was originally published in the Business Bulletin of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, www.agcc.co.uk .
