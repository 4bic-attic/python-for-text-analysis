Securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earnings and other measures adjusted to a basis other than GAAP do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as results from operating activities adjusted for depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and special charges for acquisition related restructuring costs. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance as it excludes amortization of software and intangibles (which is an accounting allocation of the cost of software and intangible assets arising on acquisition), any impact of finance and tax related activities, asset depreciation, other income and restructuring costs primarily related to acquisitions. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA: \n\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, Results from operating activities: \n\nContacts: \nEnghouse Systems Limited \nSam Anidjar \nVice President, Corporate Development \n(905) 946-3200 \n\nKeywords (optional): \n\n\nUnternehmensinformation / Kurzprofil: \n\nLeseranfragen: \nPresseKontakt / Agentur: \n\nbereitgestellt von: Marketwired \n \nDatum: 10.09.2015 - 21:00 \nSprache: Deutsch \nNews-ID 1384727 \nAnzahl Zeichen:  \ncontact information: \nCompany: Enghouse Systems Limited \nContact person:  \nTown: MARKHAM, ONTARIO \nPhone: \n\nAnmerkungen: \n\nDiese Pressemitteilung wurde bisher 2 mal aufgerufen. \n\n \nVerlinkung-Tipps: \n\nDirekter Link zu dieser Pressemeldung: \n\n\n\u00dcber einen Link auf Ihrer News-, Presse- oder Partner-Seite w\u00fcrden wir uns sehr freuen.", "source": "BusinessPress24"}
