Why haven\u2019t I made this before? It\u2019s so good, and so easy, and is the perfect fall breakfast. I have been eating this with coconut milk in the morning, and Baby Bee is eating this by the handful, so between the two of us, this granola is disappearing very quickly. \n \n\n \nThis is very easy to make, and your house will smell amazing while you\u2019re baking it! It\u2019s a variation on my favorite granola recipe \u2013 and the three main ingredients are the same: oats, maple syrup, and vegan buttery spread. \n \n\n \nI just added some pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spices, and pumpkin seeds, and boom! This granola is ready for fall. \n \nMake sure you get the pure pumpkin puree, and not the pie filling. We don\u2019t want the added sugar and other ingredients. You can use coconut oil or regular butter in place of the vegan buttery spread if you prefer. If you can eat nuts, go ahead and add some! I love the pumpkin seeds in this granola, but nuts would also be good. \n \n\n   Pumpkin Spice Granola.  \u00a0    Print      Prep time   5 mins     Cook time   55 mins     Total time   1 hour    \u00a0   Simple and tasty pumpkin spice granola is just perfect for autumn!
