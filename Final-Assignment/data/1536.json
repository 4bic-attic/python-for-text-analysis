Taiwan has a population of just over 23 million. \n \nIn 2014, there were 1,353 veterinarian hospitals around Taiwan, up 18% from the previous years. \n \nEuromonitor market intelligence firm, meanwhile, predicted that Taiwan's pet supplies market will reach NT$7.9 billion (US$242.7 million) this year, up from NT$6.4 billion (US$196.6 million) in 2009, and the pet food market will reach NT$9.3 billion (US$285.7 million), up from NT$7.8 billion (US$239.6 million) in 2009. \n \nReferences: \n \nKuo Tzu-ching\u3000\u3000\u90ed\u5b50\u83c1", "source": "Want China Times"}
