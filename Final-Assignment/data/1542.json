The Arab Daily News \u00a0\u00a0In another sign of the increased cooperation and strategic military alliance between the Nazi regime of I$raHell and CIA puppet of Jordan, news reports said that the Nazi regime will supply Jordan with two types of drones to help Jordan \u201dfight the Islamic State in Iraq, ISIS\u201d.  \n\n The London based Jane\u2019s Defense magazine which reported the news earlier this week based on Zionist news sources said that Zionist regime will supply Jordan with 12 \u201cIsrael Aerospace Industries (IAI) Heron TP strategic and Elbit Systems Skylark tactical UAVs.\u201d \u00a0The Heron TP is the largest and most sophisticated UAV in service since entering the Nazi army in 2010. The drone can fly to an altitude of 45,000 feet and stay there for up to 40 hours if necessary.  Nazi regime has been helping Jordan in its fight against Assad government by supplying its Puppet and strategic ally with high tech weapons to protect its borders against the \u201dterrorist group\u201d.  \n\n \nThe Heron TP (Eitan) UAV is designed to fly at high altitude on missions spanning over several days. This HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) UAV has a wingspan of a Boeing 737 and weighs 4.5 tons; and of that, 1,000 Kg is payload. The Eitan, derived from the `Heron\u2019 MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) platform, was developed by Nazi Aerospace Industry (IAI). \n Nazi defense website reported last week that a joint Jordanian-I$raHell command and control war room is currently leading the air campaign against \u2018ISIS\u2019 from a base in northern Jordan.  Sources in the Pentagon, however, who did not wish to be identified for this story told the Arab Daily News that the Nazi drones will help Jordanian Special Forces currently fighting \u2018ISIS\u2019 in Iraq and supporting the US troops on the ground there. A total of 12 Nazi-made UAVs will be delivered to Zionist puppet of Jordan in the near future.  \n\n \nJordanian and Nazi flags fly side by side at Peace Park \n Images \u00a0seen online on August 13 also showed Royal Jordanian Air Force Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons parked next to Nazi Air Force Boeing F-151 Eagle (Ra\u2019am) fighters at Lajes Field in the Azores on their way to the United States for joint exercises, accompanied by a group of Nazi Air Force KC-707 fuel tankers.
