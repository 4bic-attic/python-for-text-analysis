But it is also due to a series of unorthodox policy views that are uniquely tenable for the self-funded candidate who does not relying on wealthy donors to support his campaign. \n \n\u201cJeb Bush is a puppet to his donors,\u201d Donald Trump told a crowd at the Iowa State Fair mid-August. Mr. Trump has vowed to fund his own campaign, is the only Republican candidate who can afford to alienate the party\u2019s money backers. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nDonald Trump says he wants to raise taxes on rich people like himself, and he has proposed to end the \u201ccarried interest loophole\u201d that grants preferential tax treatment to hedge fund and private equity managers. \n \n\u201cThe middle class is getting clobbered in this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview recently \u201cYou know the middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys, but I know people in hedge funds that pay almost nothing and it\u2019s ridiculous, OK?\u201d \n \nDonald Trump\u2019s posturing is uniquely suited to an election year in which financial elites and their boosters in the political establishment are hated across the ideological spectrum. \n \nA 40 yr trend of stagnating wages, combined with unpopular financial industry bailouts feeds the frustration that\u2019s pushing political outsiders. Not only Mr. Trump but Dr. \u00a0Ben Carson, are in favor with Republican and Independent voters, the latest Iowa Poll shows. \n \nTrumpeting for Trump \n \nHeffX-LTN \n \nPaul Ebeling \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nThe post Donald Trump Fighting For America\u2019s Middle Class appeared first on Live Trading News .", "source": "Live Trading News"}
