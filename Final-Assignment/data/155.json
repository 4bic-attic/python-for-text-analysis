He promptly scored again from the penalty spot and then completed his hat-trick on 20 minutes with the help of a cross from Gareth Bale. \n\nKarim Benzema added a fourth before the break, and then in the second half Bale again laid on the pass for Ronaldo to strike for the fourth time and make Real Madrid history. But he was still not done, converting again from inside the area on 80 minutes.", "source": "Jersey Evening Post"}
