Colonel spent the  bulk of his 42-year career in the Royal Canadian Air Force flying fighter jets \u2013 both the CF-100 and CF-5. \n \nA few weeks ago, Kupecz was waving a protest placard in front of Trenton Memorial Hospital. \n \nKupecz, who owns a consulting firm with his wife, is a member of Our TMH. He\u2019s spent months studying other community hospitals and how they operate independently from their larger, corporate cousins. \n \nKupecz is also one of the key movers behind a plan to add a veterans\u2019 care centre to the hospital. \n \nThe idea has received attention from federal leaders and candidates of all political stripes. \n \nKupecz said veterans have always come back from foreign deployments with health issues largely misunderstood or misdiagnosed. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see the initiatives that have been started in terms of veterans\u2019 care. They are wonderful. To keep emphasizing that, we need to make sure veterans who have health issues get the very best care. And, to my mind, that means making sure they have a secure income and secure support system, with effective programs to get that support when they need it,\u201d he said. \n \nKupecz spent about 14 years outside the country. He is also an Afghan war vet. \n \n\u201cAs a veteran I feel it\u2019s important that we contribute to our alliances, as we\u2019ve done with the United Nations in the past, and stepping up to the plate when it comes to international issues. At the same time we need to support refugees and send money to all causes that are helping people around the world. International and aid support is quite important to me,\u201d he said. \n \nRed Shark Men\u2019s Wear has been a fixture in downtown Trenton since 1970. \n \nOwner Shane O\u2019Shaughnessy has seen a lot of other businesses come and go over the decades. He\u2019s also seen the good and the bad when it comes to the economy, but always managed to hang on and make a good living. \n \n\u201cLook at it this way, if the economy was good right now I wouldn\u2019t be having a buy one, get two free sale,\u201d said O\u2019Shaughnessy. \n \nBut O\u2019Shaughnessy does what he has to in order to ride out the downturn, or technical recession as he describes the state of the current economic climate. \n \nThe business owner says it\u2019s time for the federal government to inject more cash into the economy. \n \n\u201cPeople have to realize the more that\u2019s flipped over is good. Even if that\u2019s tax money.\u201d \n \nBalancing the budget, he said, isn\u2019t the answer, at least not right now. \n \n\u201cBalanced budgets are wonderful if the economy is booming, but the economy hasn\u2019t been booming in a very long time. In a technical recession there\u2019s always the risk of stagnating the economy even more by cutting programs and taking other fiscal measures in order to balance the budget. What we need now is more investment by the government,\u201d said O\u2019Shaughnessy. \n \nA pragmatist, O\u2019Shaughnessy says there\u2019s no easy fix. \n \nLowering tax rates, he said, isn\u2019t always the answer. He says the current tax structure is \u201cfair.\u201d \n \n\u201cWhat governments need to do is stop being wasteful. It\u2019s not that Canadians don\u2019t mind paying taxes. We all need health care. We need infrastructure. What we don\u2019t need government to do is waste money,\u201d said O\u2019Shaughnessy. \n \nO\u2019Shaughnessy said part of the problem is the current government has hung the economy on the price of oil. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing if oil prices are rising, but terrible if they\u2019re not. Our dollar is falling. Our economy is falling. We pegged our dollar so high that every other manufacturing job has gone to another country. The U.S. is ramping up. They are doing a lot better than we are. There\u2019s a lot of distrust with the government,\u201d he said. \n \nMost municipal leaders will tell you when it comes to federal spending, cash for infrastructure is always at the top of the list. \n \n\u201cWhen isn\u2019t it at the top of the list?\u201d said Mayor Jim Harrison. \n \nThe city is in the midst of a massive $70 million overhaul of Trenton\u2019s waste water treatment facility. About $30 million will be spent this year. \n \nThe city has received more than $3 million in funding for the project. \n \n\u201cBut we have a long way to go before it\u2019s completed. Any support will be greatly appreciated,\u201d said Harrison. \n \nBut that isn\u2019t the only project. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of underground infrastructure that needs to be replaced. As far as I\u2019m concerned, infrastructure is the number one concern,\u201d said Harrison. \n \nInfrastructure isn\u2019t the only issue in town. \n \n\u201cWe want the government to continue the work that\u2019s been done at CFB Trenton,\u201d said Harrison. \n \nHarrison said the major political parties are addressing the infrastructure deficit, the Liberals and Conservative more so. He said the Conservative government has spent a lot of money in Quinte West, and followed that up by saying the Liberals have also committed to infrastructure funding. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to the candidates to make sure they follow through on their commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut funding hasn\u2019t gone far enough. We\u2019ll push them to make sure they go beyond the envelope to help make sure our needs are met. All infrastructure is important to us. It helps us grow and makes the city a better, and safer place to live.\u201d \n \nernst.kuglin@sunmedia.ca", "source": "Community Press Canada"}
