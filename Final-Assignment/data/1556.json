The newly constructed facility on the grounds of the scenic Estero Beach Hotel and Resort featured a 1.1 mile course highlighting one of the longest straight-a-ways in short course off-road racing, along with deep, loose dirt that more closely resembled the sandy shores of Baja than the tightly compacted surface that competitors are accustomed to. \n \nAs coastal breezes and capacity crowds enveloped Adler and Team 4 Wheel Parts, driver and team were quickly tasked with preparing the 900 HP #10 for battle. A full day of practice on Friday afternoon allowed Adler the opportunity to familiarize himself with the course and prepare for the weekend of Rounds 11 & 12 of Pro4 class warfare. \n \nBaja off-road competition traditionally equates to long distance endurance competitions with spectators rarely experiencing the event beyond a few quick seconds of vehicles passing by at high speed. The fan-friendly environment at Estero Beach delivered a level of access to the teams that attendees enthusiastically embraced, and as Adler and the team worked to find their footing on the challenging track, they arrived early and en masse to take in the sights and sounds of the event. \n \n\u201cIt was quite an experience,\u201d said Adler. \u201cEveryone here knows off-road racing but rarely do they have a chance to see the trucks without their fiberglass bodies on and the crew in action. It was exciting for us to have the opportunity to engage with the fans as they experienced short course off-road racing for the first time in Baja.\u201d \n \nSaturday\u2019s qualifying session put Adler on the second row to open up the weekend\u2019s action and at the drop of the green flag, he found himself among the leaders. As the elite of off-road racing fought in the afternoon\u2019s marquee event of the day, he continued to contend for a podium spot, at one time sitting as high as second. A wild restart following a yellow flag shuffled him into third, and with just a two laps to go, his chance at a trophy slipped away as he entered a corner while approaching the front straight. A competitor pushed just underneath him taking the position and at the checkered flag, Adler found himself in fourth, just two seconds outside of the third place spot. \n \n\u201cThis is a big, fast, wide open track,\u201d he said, after the race. \u201cThese trucks are flying on this course and with a field as talented as this, just one slight mistake can be costly. The crew gave us a fast truck and it ran great. Now we just need to find that extra little bit to get us to the front.\u201d \n \nSunday\u2019s Round 12 was less forgiving. While the group remained tight through the beginning of the race, Adler maintained a top-five position while fighting through the field. A mid-race incident brought out a caution flag and in the chaos of the ensuing restart, Adler was shuffled back into the pack. He maintained a face pace but with the loose dirt creating an enormous amount of \u201croost\u201d from the truck in front of him, vision was at a premium. Resigned to bringing the truck safely home to preserve valuable points towards his season total, Adler finished the race in 8th place. \n \n\u201cThat was tough,\u201d said Adler. \u201cWe were in the thick of the fight and after the restart we were three wide going into the corner. We got caught up with too many guys fighting for the same spot and it cost us. We finished and the truck was in great shape but we were running strong and would have been a lot happier coming home with a podium.\u201d \n \nAfter a weekend of energetic, standing-room-only crowds, this inaugural event, a culmination of the efforts of Lucas Oil officials, Ensenada\u2019s Ampudia family and the Estero Beach Hotel\u2019s Gerardo Novelo and his family, was deemed a groundbreaking success as the series launched a new brand of off-road racing to the Baja California peninsula. \n \n\u201cThis was great for short course and great for the fans here in Baja,\u201d said Adler. \u201cEveryone was so welcoming and the entire experience was fantastic for our team. We\u2019re already looking forward to coming back next year.\u201d \n \nIn just three short weeks, Greg Adler and the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series return to the high-flying Wild West Motorsports Park in Reno, Nevada.
