Therefore, it is expected that the president of Pakistan would cease the use of the premises of Presidency for political meetings of his party,\u201d the four-judge bench of the LHC had said in its order on a petition filed by senior lawyer A.K. Dogar on behalf of the Pakistan Lawyers Forum challenging the holding of political office by Mr Zardari. \n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2015 \n\nOn a mobile phone?
