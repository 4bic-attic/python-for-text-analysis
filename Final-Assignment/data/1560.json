Just about every letter you read in the newspaper is about someone\u2019s religious beliefs or how sinful it is for women who become pregnant through rape or incest to abort. \n \nIf you believe, as do Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson, everything is an act of God or God\u2019s will, why aren\u2019t you angry about God aborting his own creations via miscarriages? \n \nAs a Christian who doesn\u2019t force anyone to share my beliefs or values, I can hardly believe God would be so careless with his creations as to create people attracted to the same sex and capable of loving one another. According to the Bible, the Lord came to Jeremiah saying: \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.\u201d \n \nIf these are the words of God, why would he create someone attracted to the same sex knowing they would be living in sin? \n \nGod gave us a free will. We are not programmed robots. Our strength does not come from within us, our strength comes from God through prayer. \n \nWhat may be right to you may be wrong to someone else. \n \nForget about putting Christ back in Christmas. The right-wing Christians need to put Christ back in Christianity. \n \nRON LABARGE, Salina", "source": "Topeka Capital-Journal"}
