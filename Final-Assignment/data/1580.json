Professor Beno\u00eet St-Onge of the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al is using airborne multispectral LiDAR data to identify trees by genus. The technique can differentiate between hardwood/softwood trees with only a 3-percent error rate and identify trees by genus with only a 15-percent error rate by combining information from Optech\u2019s Titan multispectral sensor and 3D data. St-Onge\u2019s techniques can be used to quickly assess large tracts of forest in applications such as carbon/biomass measurement, biodiversity, forest science and tree farming.\u00a0", "source": "Earth Imaging Journal: Remote Sensing, Satellite Images, Satellite Imagery"}
