So one night is f**k all really! But I'm rooting for them.'' \n\nDanny also revealed that although his on-screen wife Kellie Bright (Linda Carter) will be busy training for 'Strictly Come Dancing' over the next few months, there will still be plenty of big storylines for the Carter family. \n\nThe 'Football Factory' actor told OK! Online: ''Where do I start? We've got loads coming up. \n\n''New Year's Day is proper! It's all about the Carters.'' \n\nDanny's comments come after 'EastEnders' executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins warned Kellie she could be ''broken'' by her jam-packed schedule. \n\nHe told The Sun newspaper: ''I have lots of material planned for Kellie. Linda's not going to disappear because you can't have the Queen Vic without Linda. \n\n''We gave Kellie a couple of weeks off at the beginning so that she can throw herself into it ['Strictly']. But there's a point later in the run when she's going to be really busy. \n\n''There will be a point where I said to her, 'You are going to be broken'. But we'll just keep watching her, just keeping an eye on her.''", "source": "TVGuide.co.uk"}
