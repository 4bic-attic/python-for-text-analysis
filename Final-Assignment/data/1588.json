Crew Slip-Up Reveals Plot Details", "id": "7d2f9e54-b5e2-42a3-ada7-b856d45bd694", "content": "\u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 is in its sixth and final season, and despite best efforts to keep all plot details under wraps, it seems a crew slip-up has led to a huge reveal. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to find out what\u2019s coming up, then look look away now. You\u2019ve been warned\u2026 \n\n\n\nReady? OK\u2026 \n\nAccording to reports, a wedding order of service was left behind in an Oxfordshire village hall, and the detailed prop revealed that Lady Edith is set to finally get hitched, marrying a man called Herbert, who is presumed to be Bertie Pelham, from the recent Christmas special. \n\nThe Sun claims that a member of the public found the prop, which was in a village church in Bampton, a village which has frequently been used to film previous episode of the ITV drama. \n\nA source tells the paper: \u201cThe cast and crew of \u2018Downtown\u2019 have gone to great lengths to hide the storylines for the six and final series. \n\n\u201cAs it\u2019s the last one, there are going to be some absolutely massive plot lines. One of them is this wedding. \n\n\u201cIt seems a bit ridiculous that all those security measures could be put in place and then someone just leaves an order of service lying around for anyone to find.\u201d \n\nWe\u2019re currently two episodes into the final series of \u2018Downton\u2019, and while a number of cast members are understandably devastated to be waving goodbye to the period drama, Elizabeth McGovern isn\u2019t going to be reaching for the tissues. \n\nWhen quizzed on which cast members she\u2019ll miss, the star replied : \u201cI don\u2019t know how much socialising we\u2019ll do in the future.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss everybody in a different way. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one person that I can bring to mind.\u201d Lovely\u2026", "source": "Huffington Post UK"}
