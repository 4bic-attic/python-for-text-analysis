Sarma was once seen as Gogoi\u2019s blue-eyed boy. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nIn his interaction with the media on Tuesday, Sarma also thanked the people of his constituency and sought their forgiveness for not having completed his term. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHe was elected to the assembly from Jalukbari constituency three consecutive times in 2001, 2006 and 2011. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHe said he would make available to the media a copy of the resignation letter he submitted to the speaker and Congress president Sonia Gandhi among others, in which he has listed his charges against the state party leadership. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u201cI hope people of my constituency will elect me again if byelection or election is held in my seat,\u201d he added. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSpeculations are rife whether byelection will be held in the now vacant Jalukabari constituency as the 2016 assembly elections are barely six-seven months away. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nMeanwhile, principal secretary Pranab Das told the media that it was for the Election Commission to take a call on whether to hold a byelection for the Jalukbari seat or hold the election along with the rest of the state next year. \n \nThe post appeared first on The Morung Express .", "source": "Morung Express"}
