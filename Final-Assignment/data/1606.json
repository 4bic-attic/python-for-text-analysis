A gun-rights group filed a lawsuit Tuesday to try to force Florida State University to change its football \u201cGame Day Plan 2015,\u201d a 28-page information packet sent out by campus police that advises visitors firearms can\u2019t be stored in vehicles parked on campus. Florida Carry Inc. announced late Tuesday it and FSU graduate student Bekah Hargrove, a member of Florida Students for Concealed Carry, are seeking an injunction against university President John Thrasher and university Police Chief David Perry over the \u201cgame day\u201d guide. Florida Carry and Hargrove argue the \u201cgame day\u201d guide fails to follow a 2013 ruling by the 1st District Court of Appeal that said the University of North Florida cannot prevent firearms from being stowed in cars. The \u201cgame day\u201d guide provides general information on parking, traffic patterns, tailgating, concessions, and other items such as banners, drones and smoking. Under a section titled \u201cweapons,\u201d the packet states that weapons are prohibited on campus and that a \u201cfan may not store firearms or other weapons in their vehicles parked on campus while attending the game.\u201d In a release, Florida Carry Executive Director Sean Caranna called the planner \u201ca blatant attempt\u201d to \u201cenforce illegal gun control with the threat of throwing good people in jail for the lawful exercise of their right to bear arms.\u201d A university spokesman said Tuesday officials had not seen the legal documents and could not comment. The state university system and Florida Carry are awaiting a separate decision from the 1st District Court over the gun-rights group\u2019s argument that the Second Amendment should supersede a Florida law that bans firearms from university housing. by The News Service of Florida", "source": "NorthEscambia.com"}
