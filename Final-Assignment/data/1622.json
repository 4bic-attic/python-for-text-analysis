However, a market event which triggers mass selling of an asset can quickly drive down prices if vendors far outnumber buyers.\u00a0 \n\nThe decline of proprietary trading by US investor banks because of regulatory changes had compounded problems\u00a0of illiquidity, Mr\u00a0Shah said, as had a growing tendency by fund managers, exchange-traded funds (ETFs)\u00a0and\u00a0other retail investors to trade bonds rather than hold them to maturity. \n\nEven large institutional investors such as insurers and pension funds, which\u00a0normally looked to cover\u00a0long-term liabilities with long-dated investments, had become more skittish in times of market upheaval, he said. \n\nThe explosion in the\u00a0popularity of ETFs\u00a0had also widened the universe of investors looking to move in and out of assets to pocket short-term gains rather than sit on their investments, he said. \n\n\"The challenge with that is that they don't feel any transaction cost when they're allocating the risk; they go online, they click and they change an allocation,\" Mr\u00a0Shah said. \n\nHis comments are the latest from a range of fixed-income experts to warn of price gyrations when the Fed's first tightening cycle in almost a decade gets under way.\u00a0 \n\nA sell-off in emerging market and other high-risk assets in 2013 when the Fed first signalled it would wind down what became its\u00a0$US3.5 trillion QE program gave the world a taste of what could ensue when the central bank actually started lifting interest rates. \n\nThe flight to safe\u00a0haven assets became known as the \"taper tantrum\". \n\nFutures market pricing suggests the Fed will not lift interest rates at this week's\u00a0Open Market Committee meeting, which ends early on Friday Australian time.\u00a0 \n\nMr Shah agreed\u00a0with this, but expected\u00a0chairwoman Janet Yellen to leave no doubt in her statement about when and how the central bank would\u00a0begin the tightening cycle. \n\n\"The market reacted very violently when the Fed talked about tapering,\" he said. \n\n\"But the reality of tapering was actually quite constructive while it was going on. \n\n\"I think [the Fed]\u00a0would be better off hiking in the near-term, just to get it out of the way.\"", "source": "Brisbane Times"}
