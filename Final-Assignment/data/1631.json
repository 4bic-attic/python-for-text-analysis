Shares have fallen 25% over the past 12 months, whereas the S&P 500 is down 2.25%. \n \nAberle said investors calling for a split are taking a \"sum of the parts\" analysis and believe Qualcomm's two divisions \u2212 its highly profitable licensing arm and its chips unit \u2212 would be valued more highly as independent companies. \n \n\"You have to step back and say why is that and would a separation actually solve whatever the underlying issues are that are creating the current valuation?\" he said. \"You have to be careful that it's not too simplistic an analysis.\" \n \nThe company's current structure, Aberle said, also allows Qualcomm to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, since the chipmaker is well-positioned to help them expand to other countries. \nAt the same time, Aberle acknowledged that having both a chips and a licensing division has at times created conflicts with customers, \"but we manage it pretty well\". \nDealing with Jana \n \nJana in April unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm, calling its chip business \"essentially worthless\" at current valuations and pressing the company to spin it off or pursue strategic mergers or acquisitions. \n \nAberle said when Qualcomm was approached by Jana, the hedge fund which owned $2\u00a0billion in stock did not pressure it to pursue a breakup but rather wanted the company to review a split as one option to unlock value. \n \nIt is also working on adding a third independent board member, whom Aberle declined to name. Qualcomm has already added two new board members in cooperation with Jana. \n \n\"A lot of the things [Jana] put on the table were very consistent with things we'd already been talking to our shareholders about and already been planning for a long time,\" Aberle said. \n \nQualcomm said in July it would reduce costs by about $1.4\u00a0billion, cut about 4\u00a0500 full-time staff, or 15% of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders.", "source": "IT Web"}
