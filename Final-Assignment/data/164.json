They also only had 7 days to do so. \n \nThe updated policy doubles that time frame, allowing two full weeks for shoppers to get a price adjustment and allowing customers to search online or from their smartphone to do so. \n \nTarget also added 24 additional rival retailers to the expanded policy, including for the first time stores with memberships such as Costco and Sam\u2019s Club. \n \nBelow is the complete list of competitors that Target will now match online and in-store prices with: \n \nAmazon.com, Babiesrus.com, BedBathBeyond.com, Bestbuy.com, BN.com, Buybuybaby.com, Costco.com, CVS.com, Diapers.com, DicksSportingGoods.com, Drugstore.com, Gamestop.com, JCPenney.com, Kmart.com, Kohls.com, Macys.com, Newegg.com, Officedepot.com, Petco.com, Petsmart.com, Samsclub.com, Sears.com, SportsAuthority.com, Staples.com, Target.com, Toysrus.com, Ulta.com.
