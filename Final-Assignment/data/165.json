Those that won\u2019t, they\u2019re not going to be there.\u201d Lauren Victoria Burke, Managing Editor of Politic365.com, said, \u201cI think we know who would not show up.\u201d \u201cMost of the Republicans would not show up.\u201d She continued, \u201cJeb Bush, maybe Marco Rubio would show up.\u201d Martin then interjected with Bush\u2019s \u201cfree stuff\u201d\u00a0faux pas from last week, to which Burke said, \u201cThat is how they market to Black voters \u2014 the welfare queen.\u201d\u00a0Later, Martin suggested the forum\u00a0would raise the Black Lives Matter movement to a different level. \u201cBecause if you go back to 2012, when you have the Tea Party that sponsored debates \u2014 Black Lives Matter movement should do it as well,\u201d Martin said. Martin believes a Black Lives Matter-sponsored presidential debate would \u201cforce every Democratic candidate to have to show up and speak to our issues.\u201d Watch Roland Martin, GOP strategist Paris Dennard, and Lauren Victoria Burke discuss the notion of the Black Lives Matter Movement hosting/sponsoring a 2016 presidential candidate debate/forum in the video clip above.
