Seven years later, now that they know him better, 29 percent have the religion of their president wrong. During those seven years, Obama has done nothing to indicate he is anything other than the practicing Christian he\u2019s always said he was. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s become more Muslim. It\u2019s that Americans have gotten more stupid. Some things are matters of fact, and technology has made it easier than ever to confirm facts. But instead of getting everyone on the same page, technology \u2013 email, the Web, social media \u2013 has accelerated the distribution of myths, caricatures, falsehoods and lies. Call it the Misinformation Age. Ignorance isn\u2019t new, of course. Seven percent of Americans think Elvis is alive and the moon landing was a hoax. But the persistence of untruths in the political sphere, among people supposedly paying attention, is a problem on many levels. Obama\u2019s biography isn\u2019t the only example. Al Gore never said he invented the Internet, a lie that has dogged him for decades. The most recent Republican presidential debate offered several untruths: Carly Fiorina misidentifying a grisly video \u2013 and challenging others to go watch it; Donald Trump peddling long-discredited links between vaccinations and autism; Jeb Bush praising his brother George W because \u201che kept us safe\u201d \u2013 as if someone else was president when terrorists struck on Sept. 11, 2001. But the myths about Obama have a special persistence, including the much-discussed and much debunked fact of where he was born. I\u2019ll risk being obvious, because apparently 20 percent of Americans require it: Obama was born in Honolulu in 1961. We\u2019ve seen his birth certificate, of course. But his birth was also announced in the newspapers. Faking a birth certificate is hard; it\u2019s even harder to falsify newspaper pages that have been on microfilm for 50 years. As for the president\u2019s religion, Obama has told his story, and it has been confirmed by reporters and biographers: The grandfather he never met converted from animism to Islam but was not devout. The father he barely knew was an atheist. His mother and the grandparents who raised him were Unitarian Protestants. His Indonesian stepfather was a non-practicing Muslim. Obama converted to Christianity in 1988 and joined a Protestant church. Settling some disputes require both evidence and definitions. In common American usage, your religion is what you were brought up as, or the faith you choose and follow as an adult, taking its oaths, celebrating its sacraments, honoring its scriptures, and attending its services. Both point to Obama\u2019s Christianity. He was not raised a Muslim and there\u2019s no evidence that he acts like a Muslim in his religious life. So by the common American definition, he\u2019s a Christian, not a Muslim. Page 2 of 2 - I\u2019ve heard theories that purport to prove Obama is a secret Muslim, using some other definition of religious identification. But redefinition cannot change a fact. Nor can repeating a lie over and over again make it the truth. Unless it\u2019s a lie people want to believe is the truth. A lot of Republicans prefer the lie: A recent CNN poll found 43 percent of registered Republicans think Obama is a Muslim, and among supporters of Donald Trump, the number grows to 54 percent. \u201cA lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on,\u201d wrote 19th century humorist C.H. Spurgeon, a quote often wrongly attributed to Mark Twain. Even faster, he might add today, if it comes with a note line screaming \u201cForward to all your friends!\u201d Today\u2019s lies come with Photoshopped images of Obama dressed like a Islamic scholar and mash-up videos labeled \u201cObama Admits He Is a Muslim!\u201d They are peddled relentlessly by websites that have incorporated conspiracy-mongering and partisan libels into their business models. But they are just as false as the rumors spread by political enemies about every president since Washington. The truth is out there, provided by credible fact-checking organizations, but truth has always been optional in politics. Stephen Colbert had it right on his very first show, when he coined the term \u201ctruthiness\u201d to describe things that may not be true, but that FEEL like they should be true. For 29 percent of American voters, truthiness is good enough. Rick Holmes writes for GateHouse Media and the MetroWest Daily News. He can be reached at rholmes@wickedlocal.com.
