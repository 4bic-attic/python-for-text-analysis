She explained why (bunny rabbits and jesus and whatnot) to the class and everyone supported her decision, atheists, muslims, hindus, buddhists and a sikh as I recall in that class. We all had a brief laugh about people worshipping rabbits that lay eggs and went on with life. Imagine if the jackass teachers had taken that approach instead of shaming the child. The girl who cried would have learned a valuable lesson in understanding other belief systems and the boy would not have been punished and scarred for the rest of his time in that school system. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Atheism vs Christianity\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to atheism-vs-christianity+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/atheism-vs-christianity.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.", "source": "Atheism Versus Christianity"}
