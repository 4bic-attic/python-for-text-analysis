He added: \"This can have serious implications for large numbers of people just based on the whims of a small number.' \n\nA spokesman for NHS England said: \"Personal health budgets are designed to meet identified health needs in ways that give patients more control over the care and support they receive. \n\n\"The spending must be agreed between the individual and the NHS, meet the patient's individual health needs and achieve the desired outcomes. \n\n\"An independent evaluation has shown that personal health budgets are cost effective, help people manage their health and improve quality of life.\" \n\nResearch by Nick Watson, professor of health and wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, has found that patients who received the budgets had \u00a34,000 more spent on them than others receiving usual care, irrespective of the complexity of their needs. \n\nHe said: \"The policy fits the current rhetoric - it is very consumerist and individualistic. \n\n\"Looking at the level of resourcing for the project and the evidence it has been based on, I would say it's at best spurious. I think we are going forward on poor evidence and there is a clear ideological drive behind it.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "Northamptonshire Telegraph"}
