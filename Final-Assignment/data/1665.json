Delpero continued to built momentum and belted a 9.4 to put his opponent in a combination situation he could never recover from. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m super happy, that was a dream final against my good friend Tim,\u201d Delpero said. \u201cI wish it could have been against Edouard but that\u2019s how it goes. Conditions today were absolutely perfect for longboarding and we all were able to display our best surfing out there. I started with good waves early and that made Tim\u2019s job pretty hard. I\u2019m stoked to clinch the European title as well, I had a lot of fun today.\u201d \n \n \nAntoine Delpero \u00a9 WSL/Poullenot \n \nDelpero previously dispatched of younger brother Edouard in the semifinals, with a buzzer-beater near-perfect score of 9.93. Both Delpero brothers will represent Europe at the upcoming World Longboard Championship event in China, and will look to post a big result when the event commences. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a particular preparation for this event, but we\u2019re starting to know the wave well at Riyue Bay, we\u2019ve been going there for three years.\u201d Delpero continued. \u201cI was a little frustrated last year when I got a 10 and couldn\u2019t back it up.\u201d \n \nCreignou, former semifinalist at the GoPro World Longboard Championship in 2014, couldn\u2019t overcome Delpero\u2019s rhythm but kept his composure in a difficult situation to keep improving his scoreboard throughout the final and try to get out of combination. \n \n\u201cTiming was perfect and we really finished the event in the very best conditions,\u201d Creignou said. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome event, unfortunately I couldn\u2019t find the waves I needed to beat Antoine, I would have loved to win here. It\u2019s a great warm-up for China, and we\u2019re going to have a good team there, we want to keep showing that French and European longboarding are relevant.\u201d \n \nA slow first half of the women\u2019s final saw Vergara and Justine Mauvin (REU) 22, exchange medium waves and average scores before Mauvin caught the first major wave with a long hang five all the way from the outside for a 7.17. Vergara answered shortly after with a 7.57 and kept things interesting for the crowds. \n \n \nJustine Mauvin & \u200bVictoria Vergara \u00a9\u00a0WSL/Poullenot \n \nBoth surfers went blow for blow on a succession of exchanges with Mauvin taking the lead back on an 8.27 before Vergara, with two minutes remaining in the final, started a ride with a beautiful hang ten followed by a couple of turns for the winning 8.40 ride. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m super happy to win here,\u201d Vergara said. \u201cWaves were really fun and I surfed with one of my best friends. We had a lot of fun, I gave everything I had and was a little bit lucky. It\u2019s cool to surf here with friends and family being able to come support and watch us perform. We have two months now to train for China, I can\u2019t wait to go there again and hope I can better my ninth place from last year.\u201d \n \nA finalist in the opening event of 2015 in Newquay, Mauvin was one heat away from clinching a maiden regional title, but unfortunately couldn\u2019t overcome Vergara\u2019s poise and grace in the clean little peaks of Vieux Boucau in the final. \n \n\u201cThat was a fine day of surfing with good friends in super fun waves,\u201d Mauvin reflected. \u201cWe both got good scores and it came down to almost nothing. We did our best and really enjoyed competing and putting on a good show. I\u2019m going to keep training, improve and hopefully be ready for China.\u201d \n \nThe European team going to the World Longboard Championships in China will be composed of Antoine and Edouard Delpero, Timothee Creignou, Ben Skinner (GBR), Adam Griffiths\u00a0(GBR) for the men, and Vergara, Mauvin, Alice Lemoigne (REU) and Lucie Milochau (FRA) for the women. \n \nThe Longboard Pro Vieux Boucau is scheduled from September 18-20, 2015 at Plage Centrale, Vieux Boucau - France.
