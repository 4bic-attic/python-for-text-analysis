The 569.7 billion yen ($4.7 billion) deficit was the largest in seven months.\n\nThe slowdown in China's economy hit exports of steel, auto parts and metalworking machinery hardest. Exports to the U.S. rose 11 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to sales of cars and pharmaceuticals.", "source": "Kentucky.com"}
