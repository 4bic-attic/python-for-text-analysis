Written by Aguirre-Sacasa, Brides is described as\u00a0a sexy reimagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy \u2014 and their non-traditional family. The project hails from Warner Bros. Television and studio-based Berlanti Prods., with Aguirre-Sacasa, Berlanti and Berlanti Prods.\u2019\u00a0Sarah Schechter executive producing. Known in popular culture as the Brides of Dracula, the three characters, originally introduced in Bram Stoker\u2019s classic novel, are portrayed as beautiful and powerful\u00a0female vampire \u201csisters\u201d who reside with Count Dracula in his castle\u00a0in Transylvania\u00a0where they\u00a0use their charm to seduce and bewitch men before preying on\u00a0them.
