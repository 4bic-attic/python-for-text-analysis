The Chinese, as witnessed during Bersih 4, want a new government to follow Najib\u2019s departure. They no longer want the old politics of race. This is a message to Umno to re-configure their politics based on Malays dealing with non-Malays.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe Chinese have looked at Najib as a weak leader, a coward, ever since he blamed the narrow BN win in 2013 on them and called it a Chinese tsunami. He has not repeated his allegations after being advised by his people.\u201d \n \nIn tearing into Najib, Zainuddin pointed out that no Prime Minister has showed himself as having so little dignity and this he added was evident in the RM2.6 billion donation which in Najib\u2019s own words was from a foreign power. \u201cHe has admitted in his own words to being a tool of foreigners.\u201d \n \n\u201cAt the same time, he has humiliated government servants and dragged them down through transfers and removals, arrests and investigations.\u201d \n \nZainuddin appeared to accept the NGO Bersih 2.0\u2019s figures that 500,000 people turned up in Kuala Lumpur alone for the weekend Bersih 4 rallies. The Bersih 4 rallies were held in Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and 70 cities worldwide.", "source": "Free Malaysia Today"}
