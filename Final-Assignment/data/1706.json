I have been LUSTING for a swing set (things that parents say\u2026) but decided that a geodome climber was much more cost and space efficient.\u00a0 \n \n\n \nWe get an incredible amount of use out of this thing (BFF Nicole and I even climbed on it the other night!) and it\u2019s so fun to watch Henry learn to navigate it.\u00a0 I can tell that it will be used for many years by both kids.\u00a0 And get this\u2026 it was only $200 or so! \n \n\n \nThings I Want to Add to the Backyard\u2026 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nA Mud Kitchen \n \nRock climber grips along the side of the fence so Henry can climb along the side \n \nA tire swing \n \n\u00a0 \n \nA kiddie-sized picnic table \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhat do you love most about your backyard from a grown-up or kiddo perspective?", "source": "Healthy Tipping Point"}
