There will be African songs and more traditional songs that will be familiar to the audience like Amazing Grace, He\u2019s Got the Whole World in His Hands, This Little Light of Mine. They do a lot of drumming and [wear] beautiful costumes as well,\u201d she said, adding audiences are impressed by what they see.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cA lot of the time people come up so positive about the program, all of the children\u2019s energy levels and the dancing. We\u2019ve been really overwhelmed with the concerts in Canada. Everybody seems so positive and supportive.\u201d \n \nThe choir doesn\u2019t sell tickets to its concerts but rather accepts donations.\u00a0 \n \nThe proceeds go towards every choir child\u2019s education and the Music For Life program which helps improve lives and offers education for children in Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana.\u00a0 \n \nEvery year the organizers choose a different group of kids to tour from February until the end of the calendar year. The children then return to complete their education. \n \nThe choir started their Canadian leg of the tour at the end of May and will wrap up in November. \n \nThe African Children\u2019s Choir was founded in 1984 by Irish ordained minister Ray Barnett as a way to lift children and their families out of poverty.", "source": "Leduc Representative"}
