Then round out your party menu with these kid-friendly Watermelon Glazed Meatballs and let the spooktacular celebrating begin. \n \nBefore you start carving, check out a few helpful carving tips and tricks: \n The whole watermelon should be at room temperate when you carve to make cutting and slicing easier. Then chill the watermelon after cutting and before serving. Cut a small, thin, flat piece from the bottom of the watermelon before carving. This will provide a flat base, making the watermelon more stable when carving. Draw the design on the watermelon rind with a fine/medium point waterproof marker or a sharp pencil before you cut. Use a sharp knife with a pointed tip \u2013 the sharper the knife, the easier and cleaner the cuts will be. \nFor more wicked watermelon carving inspiration, visit www.watermelon.org/Carvings . \n \nRecipe: Watermelon Glazed Meatballs \n\nIngredients: \n2 tablespoons vegetable oil 24-36 frozen prepared mini meatballs 1 cup watermelon puree (instructions below) 1 cup prepared barbecue sauce \nPreparation: \nHeat oil in large heavy saute pan over medium high heat or electric skillet set on 325\u00b0F.
