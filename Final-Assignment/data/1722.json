The scientific advice has been ignored by ministers with more badgers set to die again this year.\" \n \nFarming minister George Eustice said \"strong action\" was needed to protect the dairy and beef industry by controlling the spread of TB in cattle, claiming the support of \"leading vets\" for the culling policy. \n \nAnd farmers' leaders said they were disappointed the cull had not been extended to other areas. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nFigures released earlier this week showed culling badgers has cost the taxpayer \u00a316.8 million in the past few years, or \u00a36,775 for each animal killed. \n \nThe costs were revealed by Defra in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Badger Trust, who said the figures show the policy is an \"unacceptable burden on the taxpayer\".", "source": "Durham Times"}
