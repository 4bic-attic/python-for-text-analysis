While the eight major components of the plan remain intact, new ideas for the estimated 75-acre complex were introduced publicly this week: n There could be a second hotel built to accommodate teams in town to use the youth fields. n Legends Landing \u2014 the retirement community planned for former NFL players \u2014 likely will be moved. n Residential development might be included. \u201cWhen we share renderings, we are very clear to point out those are renderings,\u201d said Pete Fierle, vice president of communications for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame Village design team had a full day of meetings scheduled Thursday, but no final decisions about the location or inclusion of elements at the Village were anticipated, those involved said. Details of the $476 million, eight-part Hall of Fame Village expansion on the Pro Football Hall of Fame campus were first announced in The Repository in May. Construction of the new Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium \u2014 the first phase of the Village \u2014 started this month, and representatives of the Pro Football Hall of Fame continue to attempt to acquire property in the area. THE PLAN The original plan presented for the Village included the stadium, upgrades to the museum, a four-star hotel and conference center, an NFL-themed attraction area, youth fields, an assisted living facility, a center for excellence, and retail and restaurant space, with a targeted completion date of 2018. Pro Football Hall of Fame executives at the time cautioned the plan would fluctuate. At Wednesday\u2019s Plain Local Schools Board of Education meeting, executives from Industrial Realty Group \u2014 the master developer for the project \u2014 talked about some new ideas for the complex. There could be a residential component added to serve as a buffer between the Village and adjacent neighborhoods. Offices for Pro Football Hall of Fame officials might be moved out of the museum and into a new structure, and other high-profile clients \u2014 including the NFL and USA Football \u2014 might potentially be interested in opening offices there, too. Memorabilia not on display in the museum might decorate restaurants and the hotel. There likely will be nine youth fields, and a second hotel, possibly with a more moderate room rate, could be built. Legends Landing, which initially was plotted on the far end of the campus near the interstate, will be moving, but it\u2019s not clear where. Tracy Green, president of IRG Realty Advisors, said Thursday he didn\u2019t have more information about potential changes and that the design team wouldn\u2019t make final decisions Thursday. Page 2 of 2 - FINANCING THE PROJECT Also on Wednesday, developers asked Plain Local Schools board members to consider approving a tax-increment financing agreement to help fund the project. Under a TIF, developers would pay property taxes as normal on the existing value of the property, but a chunk of the new taxes they\u2019d pay when the property value rises as Hall of Fame Village is built would be diverted for future improvements. At the meeting, project leaders said they already have approached the Canton City Schools, city of Canton officials and Plain Township trustees about a TIF agreement. Plain Township Trustee Scott Haws on Thursday said a TIF was mentioned during individual meetings trustees had about development at the Village, but they haven\u2019t received information about a suggested abatement percentage or length of the agreement. Canton Deputy Mayor Fonda Williams could not be reached immediately for comment. Representatives for both Plain Local Schools and Canton City Schools said Thursday the terms of the proposed TIF agreement haven\u2019t been shared with their districts yet. Other financing options for the project include designating the acreage a tourism development district to recoup additional sales taxes from leased property or sales; pitching the concept to foreign investors; and using the developer\u2019s capital.
