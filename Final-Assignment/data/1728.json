Without seeing the tape, Michigan State coaches felt there were at least some. \n\nHarlon Barnett\u2019s main reason to be happy after Saturday\u2019s 35-21 victory? \n\n\u201cThank God we\u2019re done with Air Force,\u201d said the Spartans\u2019 first-year co-defensive coordinator. \n\nFourth-ranked MSU began readying to face the Falcons\u2019 deceptive triple option offensive attack during spring practices. Coaches said they continued to sprinkle in a preparation period throughout preseason camp in August. \n\nIt resulted in a bend-but-don\u2019t-break performance Saturday. Air Force\u2019s 279 rushing yards were the most since the Spartans allowed since conceding 313 yards to Nebraska on Nov. 3, 2012. The Falcons averaged 5.5 yards per carry. \n\nSenior safety RJ Williamson said the Spartans \u201cdon\u2019t normally see teams like this.\u201d \n\nPart of why the Spartans devoted extra time to Air Force, which is rare for coaches while prepping for other games, is that playing against a triple option goes against much of what coach Mark Dantonio and his staff teach defensively about swarming to the ball. One missed assignment by overpursuing the wrong Falcon could lead to big plays. \n\nAt times, it did. However, MSU players avoided mental fatigue thanks in part to Dantonio rotating players throughout the game. \n\n\u201cI think you look at things and correct things and you learn from it,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cYou put this in the bank and say, \u2018This is a way we did this.\u2019 \u2026 But it will be a different offense next week, so we\u2019ll go back to what we do a little bit more, but there\u2019s components of it that we\u2019ll use.\u201d \n\nOnce MSU began keying on the run, the Falcons opened up their rarely used passing attack. Backup senior quarterback Karson Roberts was 5 of 8 passing for 150 yards in the second half. \n\nRoberts faked an option run to his left, and hit receiver Jalen Robinette in stride behind the befuddled MSU secondary for a 38-yard touchdown that made it 35-14. \n\nThe Spartans got a pair of fourth-down stops in the red zone, as well as a fumble return touchdown and an interception from Williamson. \n\n\u201cThey have a good team,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said. \n\nThe Spartans won\u2019t face another triple option team this season, which renders much of the preparation and some of the problems a one-game issue. \n\nDantonio cited missed tackles and improper technique in taking on blocks that will command fixing. \n\n\u201cWhen it comes for us to play those types of teams and run into other teams who excel in the option, then we know how to stop it, because we\u2019ve been there before and we can make adjustments from there,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut as far as today? I don\u2019t think we look at it too much.\u201d \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1KnPSbh", "source": "Detroit Free Press"}
