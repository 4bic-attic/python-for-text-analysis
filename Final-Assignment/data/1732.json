Donnie Brasco. Willy Wonka (after Gene Wilder perfected the role). \n \n\u00a0 \n \nThat was Depp. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nGilbert Grape. Ed Wood. Edward Scissorhands. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nYep. Depp. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBut this, too, is Depp: Starring roles in one flop (\u201cMortdecai\u201d this year), after another (\u201cTranscendence\u201d in 2014), after another (playing Tonto in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d). \n \n\u00a0 \n \nDepp needed a meaty role in a critically acclaimed movie in the worst way, and he got both with \u201cBlack Mass,\u201d in theaters this weekend nationwide, at Tinseltown in Summit Township, and The Movies at Meadville. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \nDepp is getting arguably the finest reviews of his career for his tour de force performance as real-life gangster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, who turned South Boston in the 1970s into his personal killing fields. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nDepp, now 52, has knocked on Oscar\u2019s door three times, with best actor nominations for \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\u201d \u201cFinding Neverland,\u201d and \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \n \nPlaying the infamous Bulger, and playing it well, is the perfect character grist for Depp to finally walk away with his first Academy Award. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u201cBlack Mass,\u201d directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart\u201d), has a deep cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Sarsgaard and Kevin Bacon, and looks to be the first big release of the fall movie season.", "source": "GoErie Blogs"}
