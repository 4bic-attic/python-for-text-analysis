We should break-up now\u201d. She said and then sipped the remaining mocha-chino from her cup. He was searching for an answer. They have been through this conversation almost a dozen times. Now he was really tired of this relationship. It\u2019s been 2 years. He had tried a lot to make it work. He has sacrificed a lot. He has crossed all his limits. And he loved her more than anything. A boy loves with all his heart. A girl loves with her brain. A boy will love the girl without knowing her, her family, her tastes, her likes, her dislikes and then try to fit into her image of a good boyfriend/husband. A girl also starts to love without knowing anything, but then rest of the relationship she tries to modify or reshape the boys interest, his style, his likes, his dislike, his passions and even his way of thinking. For a boy it\u2019s, \u201cif you are with me I\u2019ll do anything for you\u201d. But for a girl it\u2019s \u201cif you do this, this and this, for me than I will \u2018think\u2019 about you\u201d.

A girl needs a secure future, a stable monthly income, a good house, a good car, a high-profile school for her children. And that too when she is 23 and the boy is 24. She won\u2019t allow the boy some time to earn and settle down. She wants it now and once for all. \u201cOk\u201d, he said and went up to the billing corner, paid off the bill and left her sitting alone. She knew he will call him after an hour and apologize and say \u201cbaby, give me some time, I know it\u2019s my fault, I am looking for a better job and will soon be earning good. And I have talked with my dad we will soon be selling off the land in village and build a home in town, and baby I know you are doing this for us. You just stay with me I\u2019ll do whatever you say.\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 And the chutzpa (foolishness) continues until she eventually will stop receiving his calls and settle down with a wealthy, good guy. \u00a9fidoic", "source": "Some Serious Stuff!"}
