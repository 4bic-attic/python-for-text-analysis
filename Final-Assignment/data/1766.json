Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, is this year's Drill Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer is the Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the Year. Mercer is assigned to the 95th Division, 108th Training Command. This year's Advanced Individual Training Platoon Sergeant of the Year is Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez of Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas. All three soldiers were recognized Thursday evening at an awards ceremony at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Each received the Meritorious Service Medal. The Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year event is a four-day, \"best-of-the-best\" contest that puts competitors through physical and mental tests, according to information from the Army. Competitors must battle fatigue, weather and surprise events to earn the coveted titles. They must perform and instruct more than 50 tasks and drills including unknown distance runs and foot marches, rappelling, orienteering, obstacle courses, physical readiness training and appearances before a board of command sergeants major to demonstrate their knowledge of leadership and training tasks. While the Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant competition is similar to other competitions across the Army, this event focuses on competitors' ability to teach, as their day-to-day job requires them to effectively teach the Army's newest soldiers. This year, four active-duty and two Army Reserve drill sergeants competed for the Drill Sergeant of the Year title. Eight AIT platoon sergeants competed this year. All were competition winners at their respective installations or Army Reserve divisions. A closer look at this year's winners: \u2022 \u00a0Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller As Drill Sergeant of the Year, Miller will be moving to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where he will work at the Center for Initial Military Training. There, he\u2019ll have a chance to provide input and help shape the way the Army trains new soldiers. Miller, 30, joined the Army in November 2006. He completed military police one station unit training at Fort Leonard Wood in April 2007 and has served in MP units at Fort Carson, Colorado, Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and Fort Leonard Wood. Miller, who is working on his bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice, has deployed twice to Iraq. His awards and decorations include an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. Miller, who has been a drill sergeant since March 2013, was in disbelief that he won. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d he said. \u2018It was definitely a long competition, a long week of hard, intense training.\u201d Page 2 of 3 - To prepare for the competition, Miller trained hard, including lots of foot marches, long-distance running and sprints. He also studied up on Army drill and ceremony and all the other tasks soldiers must know. \u201cThis competition was very intensive,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEverybody that came here were all winners. Going up against the top of the top here was just unreal.\u201d At the same time, the soldiers shared a common camaraderie, Miller said. \u201cWe all came together, we helped each other out, pushed each other,\u201d he said. His advice for those looking ahead to next year\u2019s competition: \u201cPrepare for anything. You need to be fully well rounded when you come here.\u201d \u2022 \u00a0Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer Mercer joined the Army in July 2002, training as an X-ray technologist. He has served primarily in Oklahoma and has deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Mercer is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, with a degree in administrative leadership. His awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The 31-year-old said he was \u201crelieved, excited\u201d when he learned he had won. \u201cJust so many emotions wrapped up in my body right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in shock still or what\u2019s going on. It shows that hard work pays off.\u201d Mercer started training for the competition in October. In addition to the physical training, Mercer spent three hours every night studying every Army regulation, field manual and publication he could find. \u201cMy wife\u2019s glad this is over because we can spend time together now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very long, strenuous, and I may have trained too hard physically in the end, but I got where I needed to be. Determination and adrenaline go a long way.\u201d Mercer said he\u2019s glad for the experience. \u201cI\u2019ve made some good friends here, met a lot of great people, a lot of knowledgeable people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an honor to compete against and alongside every single person that was here this week.\u201d \u2022 Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez Enriquez, 30, is a combat medic who joined the Army in August 2002. Before his assignment as an AIT platoon sergeant at Fort Sam Houston, Enriquez served multiple tours with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

His awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Senior Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge. Page 3 of 3 - Winning the competition \u201cstill seems surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still soaking it in.\u201d Enriquez, who has been an AIT platoon sergeant since January, also will be moving to the Center for Initial Military Training. \u201cI\u2019m part of something bigger now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m part of a different level of the Army where I can make huge changes. Before, I loved it, and I could always make change, but it was more incremental. Here I can help make gigantic changes that could shape the future of the Army.\u201d In his new assignment, Enriquez will be responsible for providing input that will shape the initial entry process, whether it\u2019s basic training or AIT. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty grand thing, just thinking about the fact that you\u2019re changing the way the Army trains its soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in this position.\u201d", "source": "Waynesville Daily Guide"}
