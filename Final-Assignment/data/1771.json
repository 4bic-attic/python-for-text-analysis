Confusingly, Nacken's fellow soldiers on the Normandy battlefield told Corporal Roberts he was 7ft 6in. \n\nThe discrepancy might be explained by Nacken's civilian background in freak shows. Circus owners often lied about the dimensions of their tallest, fattest or shortest stars to enhance their popularity. \n  \nMan mountain: Jakob Nacken\u00a0returned to New York to capitalise on this new-found international celebrity - at first\u00a0signing up as the world's biggest Father Christmas (left) and starring in Ripley's Believe It Or Not on Broadway. He is pictured (right) with one of somewhat smaller co-stars \n\nAt least one giant was sacked on the spot when the circus boss found someone two inches taller, archives record. \n\nNacken eventually returned to Germany and died 1987 at the age of 81. \n\nSpeaking previously, Mr Roberts, who settled in Britain after the war, said he was 'delighted' when his PoW had finally been identified after so many years. \n\nHe said: 'I never knew his name, only that he was a lance corporal. \n\n'But he spoke very good English and one of my mates later asked him where he learned it and he explained he used to be in the circus in America.\u00a0 \n\n'I'm not surprised he made the most out of his height - there couldn't have been many taller than him.' \n\nMrs Roberts, now 92, has now been awarded\u00a0France's top honour 71 years later.\u00a0 \n  \nWar hero: Corporal Bob Roberts pictured, left, during World War Two and, right, with his Legion d'honneur medal after being awarded France's highest honour for bravery \n\nHe escaped death when a sniper's bullet grazed his temple, survived a shell blast that killed the man next to him, saw an enemy spy shot dead just as she was about to kill him and came out on top of a duel with a German officer.\u00a0 \n\nLast year, the French government announced it was to honour all living Allied servicemen who helped liberate the country from the Nazis by awarding them the prestigious Legion d'honneur. \n\nWhen Bob's granddaughter, Melanie Vass, wrote to the MoD for his medal in April, the application joined a queue of 3,000 others. \n\nNothing was heard until this week when the great-grandfather received the award in the post without ceremony. \n\nMr Roberts, from Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'I thought it was never going to come and was a bit surprised when it arrived recorded delivery in the post. \n\n'But I am glad it has and I feel very lucky and privileged to have it.I just doing my bit in the war and was very lucky a number of times. \n\n'I think that if you are entitled to it you should have it without having to beg or chase after it.'", "source": "Capital Bay"}
