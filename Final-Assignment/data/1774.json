They will play Phoenix, which swept Tulsa in the other semifinal. Game 1 is on Thursday night in Minnesota. \n  \n\u201cThe longer this team plays, the better we\u2019re going to get,\u201d Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. \n\nCandace Parker had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the Sparks, who haven\u2019t been to the conference finals since 2012. They trailed by 14 points in the first half but rallied to cut the deficit to one in the fourth quarter. \n\nThe Lynx responded with a 9-0 run to hold off Los Angeles. \n\n\u201cWe were stagnant in the first half and we shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut we were able to bounce back and make it a game.\u201d \n  \nMinnesota outscored Los Angeles 22-4 in second-chance points and converted 15 turnovers into 20 points to improve to 18-2 all-time at home in the postseason, the best record in WNBA history. \n\n\u201cThat was the Lynx team I was hoping for in that we were aggressive in everything that we did,\u201d Reeve said. \n\nJust like everything else this season for the Lynx, who won two championships in three seasons before losing to the Mercury in last year\u2019s conference finals, nothing came easy in this series. They edged the Sparks by two points in Game 1, were beaten convincingly in Game 2 in Los Angeles and had a runaway in Game 3 get a little too close for comfort in the second half. \n  \nThe Lynx entered the season among the favorites to get out of the West and only bolstered those odds when they acquired Sylvia Fowles from Chicago midway through the season. But injuries to Augustus and Lindsay Whalen and Fowles\u2019 gradual transition back to playing after sitting out in Chicago made it difficult for them to forge any kind of continuity heading into the playoffs. \n\nAfter dropping Game 2, the Lynx were in danger of a massively disappointing first-round exit entering the elimination game. \n \n\r\r \n  \nMoore and Augustus struggled mightily in the early going, shooting just 2 for 13 in the first quarter. \n\nBut the suffocating Lynx defense squeezed Parker and the Sparks. Los Angeles shot just 26.7 percent in the first quarter and turned the ball over 10 times in the first 13 minutes to fall behind by 14 points. \n\n\u201cThey put a lot of pressure on us and we didn\u2019t deal with it very well,\u201d Sparks coach Brian Agler said. \n\nParker was whisper quiet in the first half, rendered ineffective by Rebekkah Brunson\u2019s physical defensive presence. She didn\u2019t hit a shot until 90 seconds into the second quarter and didn\u2019t hit her second field goal until there was less than two minutes to play in the half. \n  \nShe came alive in the third quarter, scoring 13 points on 5-for-6 shooting to bring the Sparks roaring back. Her two free throws with just under nine minutes to go in the game cut the deficit to one, but the Lynx scored the next nine points and Parker gave them another one when she picked up a technical foul for arguing with the officials after a five-second call that gave Minnesota a 75-67 lead with 3:30 to play. \n\nFowles scored nine of her 13 points in the fourth quarter and Whalen had 14 points and six rebounds. \n  \n\u201cWe really came together, especially at the hardest parts of the game,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cThat cohesion was huge for us. We needed it.\u201d", "source": "Inland Valley Daily Bulletin"}
