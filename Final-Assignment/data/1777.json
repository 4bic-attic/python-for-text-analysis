Under the terms of the offer, Horizon is offering an exchange ratio of 0.95 of Horizon shares for each share of Depomed, remaining unchanged from its prior unsolicited proposal. \n \nThe Company noted that on August 19 , the Depomed Board unanimously rejected Horizon's revised proposal that provided for an exchange ratio of 0.95 of Horizon shares for each share of Depomed.\u00a0 The Board strongly believed that the revised proposal significantly undervalued Depomed, and did not reflect the value Depomed would contribute to the combined company or the value of the synergies from the transaction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nDepomed's Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and evaluate Horizon's exchange offer.\u00a0 Following completion of this review and evaluation, Depomed will advise shareholders of the Board's position regarding the exchange offer by making available to shareholders, and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9. Applicable securities laws prevent Depomed from making any further comments on Horizon's exchange offer or its terms until after this filing is made on Schedule 14D-9 which will be no later than 10 business days from today. Until that time, Depomed shareholders are advised to take no action. \n \nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Leerink Partners LLC are serving as financial advisors to Depomed and Baker Botts L.L.P. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP are serving as legal counsel. \n \nAbout Depomed \n \nDepomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes products for pain and neurology related disorders.
