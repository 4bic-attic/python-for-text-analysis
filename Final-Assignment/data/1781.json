The 39th Annual Historic Bristol Day, sponsored by the Bristol Cultural & Historical Foundation on Saturday, Oct. 17, celebrates the diversity of Bristol\u2019s history. \n\nBCHF is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving over three centuries of Bristol\u2019s history and increasing cultural opportunities for all residents of the community, promoting pride which translates into helping and enhancing the treasure that has been inherited. \n\nDiversity encompasses all the different elements of the human races, such as ethnicity, gender, nationality, gender identity and status, as well as citizenship, religion, age, ability and socio-economic status, experiences, viewpoints and backgrounds. The word diversity has become a popular topic for academic clarifications as well as routine dining room conversation. To value diversity is to respect each human\u2019s worth. Acknowledging diversity requires acceptance on all levels. \n\nA community is strengthened when it recognizes and appreciates, understands and embraces the varied backgrounds. Everyone can contribute and benefit from the broad spectrum of unique human qualities. Diversity is the energy that enlivens our very colorful environment where everyone just lives and works together and no character is insignificant. \n \nEach day, Bristol Borough celebrates centuries of American life, the stories of ordinary people from diverse backgrounds who have worked together for generations to build an extraordinary town. \n\nHistoric Bristol on the Delaware has been a site of recreational venues for centuries. The Historic Bristol Day events celebrated along Radcliffe Street and various parts of the Borough\u2019s Cultural Corridor on the third Saturday of October, are the most reminiscent of the great fairs held in the town during the colonial period. \n\nMark your calendar for the 39th Annual Historic Bristol Day of Diversity on Saturday, Oct. 17. This is one event each year that you will put on your calendar in ink rather than pencil because the BCHF goal, as always, is to produce a top tier event that is enjoyable and most exciting for every visitor. \n\nHBD Chairperson Elizabeth \u201cLiz\u201d [McCarry] Fisher suggested this year\u2019s theme \u201cDiversity\u201d to celebrate all the backgrounds. \u201cAll the families have lived and worked together.\u201d \n\nHer family celebrated St. Patrick\u2019s Day every year at Howley\u2019s Bar that was located on the corner of Washington and Pond streets.

Thomas was the last to survive of 10 brothers and sisters. \n\nDiversity provides a lesson for each of us to accept people for who they are and be open with things that set us apart \u2013 race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical and mental ability and language. \u201cGrowing up in the mill town of Bristol left only fond memories even though no one was very affluent.\u201d Sidney Lawrence \u201cSid\u201d Taylor confirmed, \u201cEveryone got along as kids, everyone got along pretty good.
