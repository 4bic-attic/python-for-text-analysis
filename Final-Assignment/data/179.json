The two 6A powers will meet again Thursday at Frank Herald Fieldhouse. \n\nThe Trojans\u2019 Anabella Pope was named the tournament\u2019s most valuable player, and Jenks\u2019 Maggie Hembree and Ally Stoner joined her on the all-tournament team. Cascia Hall\u2019s Amanda Outlaw, Broken Arrow\u2019s Makina Wratten, NOAH\u2019s Malia Leatherland and Claremore Sequoyah\u2019s Karlye Wagner also picked up all-tournament accolades. \n\nSilver for Lincoln Christian: Mount Saint Mary, ranked third in Class 4A, knocked off 4A\u2019s top team, Lincoln Christian, 3-1 (25-21, 23-25, 25-19, 25-18) in the finals of the LCS Invitational on Saturday. The Bulldogs had gone 4-0 in tournament play before settling for second place. \n\n\u201cWe really played well this weekend, I thought,\u201d said Lincoln Christian coach Zac Briscoe, whose team had beaten Mount Saint Mary 3-1 on Aug. 31. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t play our best in the final, and Mount Saint Mary probably had a lot to do with that.\u201d \n\nLincoln Christian is now 19-3 and will find out its regional tournament assignment Thursday. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played great all season, and we are off to our best start in school history,\u201d Briscoe said. \u201cBut we need to retool some things and get better in the next few weeks to be ready for state.\u201d \n\nMustangs charging hard: Okay missed out on last year\u2019s Class 3A state tournament, and that didn\u2019t sit well with the Mustangs, coach Belinda Clark said. \n\n\u201cLosing at regionals last year by just three points served as a motivator for these girls,\u201d she said. \n\nThe 3A No. 2 Mustangs have turned that inspiration into a 21-6 record with the playoffs fast approaching. Clark also alluded to another reason for success. \n\n\u201cHaving a court full of good hitters has also helped us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not dependent on one or two. We can hit from anywhere.\u201d \n\nAsked to point to a couple of key contributors, Clark couldn\u2019t help but name nearly everyone on her team \u2014 hitters/blockers Karleigh McMahan, Kirstyn Anderson, Summer Milligan and Blake Judkins, setter Jade Hopkins, libero Macy Haley and junior varsity call-up, Emily Taylor. \n\n\u201cTo ask who is leading the way, I would have to say they all are,\u201d Clark said. \n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without all of them together. They are all key players in our game.\u201d \n\n\u2014 BEN JOHNSON, World Correspondent", "source": "Tulsa World"}
