Isn\u2019t that like Hannibal Lecter giving you tips on personal safety? Actually, her insights into human foibles, which she exploits to great success at the gaming table, are very helpful for managing your investments. \nDuke, who has won top honors at the World Series of Poker, gave a bravura presentation a few months ago to the Investment Management Consultants Assoc., or IMCA , in (where else?) Las Vegas. As Financial Planning magazine\u2019s Scott Wenger wrote, channeling the famed Kenny Rogers song, \u201cThe Gambler ,\u201d Duke shared her thoughts with financial advisors on \u201chow to know when to hold \u2019em, know when to fold \u2019em, and how to advise clients who may want to walk away or run.\u201d \nWhen she was younger, Duke pursued a Ph.D in cognitive psychology at Columbia University. She shucked the ivy-walled academic life for the world of felt-topped tables and cards, but used her knowledge of human behavior to great effect in the casino. As the Gambler tells Kenny Rogers: \u201cI\u2019ve made a life/Out of readin\u2019 people\u2019s faces/Knowin\u2019 what the cards were/By the way they held their eyes.\u201d \nAt first blush, financial planning seems far afield from poker. But that isn\u2019t so. Both involve human psychology and guarding against bad luck. \nIf you had a soundly diversified portfolio during the 2007-09 financial crisis, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 slid almost 56%, your fall would have been far less severe. And if you sold all your stock in March 2009, which turned out to be the trough of the bear market, you missed an enormous run-up that obliterated your losses. \nBack in the Cold War, Pentagon strategists sought to find a game to model how to anticipate and counter Soviet actions, Duke told IMCA conferees. At first, the war planners favored chess due to its intricate moves. But then they settled on poker, owing to its dependence on psychology and its need for sussing out a host of unknowns. \u201cPoker is a game of decision making under conditions of uncertainty over time,\u201d she said. \nDuke ticked off numerous mistakes that investors make. One is to keep at a course of action because they already have committed a lot of money to it, even though the evidence suggests the odds of future success are low. Perhaps you\u2019ve centered your investments on gold , despite its epic fall \u2013 almost 40% over the past four years. Absent an economic collapse or rabid inflation, a turnaround in the yellow metal is unlikely anytime soon. Too bad if you want to pay Junior\u2019s tuition bill with your gold-trading profits. With gold, you should\u2019ve folded \u2018em. \nAnother common failing, Duke said, is failure to invest for the future \u2013 because seeing yourself years from now is difficult. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t know our future selves,\u201d she said. Since that person is a stranger, you direct all your financial decisions to meeting today\u2019s wants and needs, tending to the person you know well: you, circa 2015. The retirement account gets short shrift. A good poker player thinks several hands ahead. \nShe noted that advisors strive to teach clients how to learn from such past mistakes. Advisors, she said, combat investors\u2019 self-delusion. \u201cIf you credit all wins to your skill and all losses to bad luck, you never learn and never improve.\u201d \nThe Gambler described his secret as \u201cknowin\u2019 what to throw away, and knowin\u2019 what to keep.\u201d \nHe and Annie Duke have much to teach us. \nFollow AdviceIQ on Twitter \u00a0 at\u00a0 @adviceiq .  \nAdviceIQ delivers quality personal finance articles by both financial advisors and AdviceIQ editors.
