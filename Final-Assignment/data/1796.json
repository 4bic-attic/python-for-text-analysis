This is being accomplished with the emphasis on in-house mentoring along with professional development and career planning. We help employees look 2-3 years into their future to cooperatively work toward helping them achieve their goals and integrate that into the success plan for the organization. \n \nI have been at several organizations where the growth and development opportunities that existed for the organization were significant but ultimately the organizational structure or the limitations set by the leadership got in the way of the growth of the organization. This is where EVstudio is different from an employee\u2019s perspective. EVstudio has a unique blend of visionary leadership that is willing to encourage and support the professional grow of individuals because it is seen as a way that both the individual and organization can grow to the next level. \n \nConsider becoming part of the EVstudio culture of opportunity! \n \n\u201cThe Growth and Development of People is the Highest Calling of Leadership.\u201d \u2013 Harvey S.
