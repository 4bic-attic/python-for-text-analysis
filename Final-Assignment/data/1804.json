The competition is also known for the flamboyance and creativity of its costumes. \n \nCollins took many of the routines she premiered in Sydney, including a high energy and tongue-in-cheek performance mixing Beyonc\u00e9 and a traditional war dance, to Samoa. \n \nIn Sydney, Collins wowed the judges when she said that she hoped her success would be a positive example to young trans* people. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just all about saving lives and knowing there is a high suicide rate among transgenders I want to be an advocate to stop that and bring awareness to help those kids,\u201d she told the Star Observer at the time. \n \nThe overall crown was taken out by New Zealand\u2019s entry, Steve Auina, who had previously won the Miss Auckland Fa\u2019afafine completion. \n \nWatch the\u00a0video below of\u00a0highlights from the event in Samoa: \n \n[embedded content] \n \nIn this\u00a0month\u2019s Star Observer magazine, out on Thursday, we go behind the scenes with Ella Collins and the other contestants at this year\u2019s Miss Fa\u2019afafine Australia to explore\u00a0the fa\u2019afafine culture.", "source": "Sydney Star Observer"}
