The pipeline company from Texas, Kinder Morgan, intends to install a high-pressure gas pipeline under the bike path in West Peabody. Just try and stop them. \n \nWho cares? (I don\u2019t live in West Peabody). \n \nWho cares? (I don\u2019t use the bike path). \n \nWho cares? (I don\u2019t drink water). \n \nWhat? \n \nThis Peabody bike path runs beside the Ipswich River,\u00a0which is drinking water for 15 cities and towns. \n \nKinder Morgan has stated it\u2019ll take be a year to rip up the\u00a0ground, tear down the trees, and bury this huge pipeline. \n \nHow will they do it?...with construction equipment like\u00a0bulldozers, steam shovels, tractors and portable diesel generators. This equipment doesn\u2019t have to comply with the same pollution standards of diesel trucks and buses used on our roads. These machines use non-road diesel fuel, which contains as much as 200 times the sulfur that\u2019s allowed in highway diesel fuel. The exhaust from these machines will settle into the Ipswich River. Do we really want families to drink this \u2018new\u2019 water? \u2026to cook with it? \n \nWake up Peabody (and all who drink from the Ipswich River). There\u2019s a new bully in town. \n \nTo help stop this unnecessary pipeline visit www.peabodycitizensunited.org . \n \nMitch", "source": "Salem Evening News"}
