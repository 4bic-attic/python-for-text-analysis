MAYBE. (photo: Nicole Rivelli/FOX) Let\u2019s talk about Jerome Valeska.\u00a0After all, that\u2019s all Gotham seems to want to talk about. Have you seen the promotional materials? Or any of the trailers? Or TV spots? Or, you know, watch one or two episodes from Gotham\u2018s second season? Gotham creator Bruno Heller and Co. are really, really proud of their little red-haired, wide-grinned villain it seems, and it\u2019s becoming a little grating. \u201cNothing more infectious than laughter,\u201d indeed. Not to say Cameron Monaghan isn\u2019t currently winning Scenery-Chewer of the Year right out from under Jessica Lange\u2019s torture-porn leg-stumps. After a, ahem, less than complimentary first impression of his performance, I\u2019ve learned to appreciate Mr. Monaghan\u2019s performance. At the very least, he\u2019s\u00a0great at doing other actor\u2019s\u00a0Joker. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s brought one unique tic or trait to the character, but if you were looking for a perfect amalgam of Jack Nicholson (the smile), Mark Hamill\u00a0(the low laughs), and Heath Ledger (literally everything else), boom you got it. And at the very best, Monaghan is most definitely going for it. Actually, as I pointed out last week, that seems to be the theme of season two \u2014 just throw bat-shit at the wall and see what sticks. Trying to burn a bus full of cheerleaders alive? Russian roulette? Cannibalism? Mass shootings? A villain team-up named the Maniax, a name I\u2019d think was cool as hell if I happened to still be in 4th grade? Check, check, check to everything, and then some. For the record, though, I love this tactic. Love it. It\u2019s almost like watching an entirely different show, a show that isn\u2019t concerned by wowing you with serious, gritty comic book stories and instead throws a vaguely clown-shaped fist into your face for 40-something minutes. But the worry here is that Gotham becomes so off-the-wall, that the actual\u00a0storytelling of the entire thing falls entirely to the wayside. I watched \u201cKnock Knock\u201d twice and the second viewing, where I paid closer attention, was not flattering. Underneath the madness is a narrative laziness, an assumption that if Gotham can distract you with loud bangs and bright lights, you won\u2019t notice that nothing makes sense. The show has become\u00a0a fun, but insane, train ride, but that train is dipping dangerously close to running completely off the tracks. Here are just five examples of some plot-points that are\u00a0unforgivably lazy: The fact that Bruce Wayne and his most trusted confidante Alfred have a massive falling out, Bruce fires Alfred and banishes him from Wayne Manor, and the two have a reconciliation \u2014 all over the course of a half an hour. Harvey Bullock\u2019s advice to Jim:\u00a0\u201cThose lunatics specifically chose that shipyard.\u201d Uh, no they didn\u2019t? Why does he think that? They robbed exactly one shipyard. Robbing one out of one shipyards is not a pattern, or a motive. The \u201cdetective work\u201d on Gotham has always been weak, but this wasn\u2019t even an attempt. What saves the bus full of cheerleaders from a fiery doom? A lighter failing to work\u2026.twice. After, I don\u2019t know, three or four MASS SHOOTINGS, why doesn\u2019t the GCPD station have better security? AND WHO LET THAT 13-YEAR OLD MILLIONAIRE ON TO THE CRIME SCENE OF A MASS SHOOTING? Just\u2026 come on,\u00a0Gotham. I love ya\u2019. But take a chill pill for ten seconds. Just ten seconds. Check your work. Dot your I\u2019s, cross your T\u2019s, and maybe spell Maniax correctly, and then you wouldn\u2019t have a spare body to throw off the roof. Just saying. As always, let\u2019s run down every reference, fact, and nugget of Bat-history brought up season two, episode two,\u201d Knock, Knock.\u201d Alfred and Luscious Fox This isn\u2019t so much a reference as it is a fun little tid-bit.\u00a0The last time I caught up with Sean Pertwee, he said the first time he performed this (fantastic) scene was years ago, as part of his audition for Alfred Pennyworth. The problem was, due to the secretive nature of Gotham\u2018s casting process\u00a0no one could\u00a0tell Mr. Pertwee he even was playing Alfred Pennyworth. The only direction given\u00a0for the audition\u00a0was \u201ca Brit walks into an American bar and has a conversation.\u201d An entire season later, and London native\u00a0Bruno Heller finally saw the opportunity to plant\u00a0the Alfred-audition dialogue into a\u00a0Gotham scene. Also, I noticed this scene was filmed in The Campbell Apartment, which is a speakeasy in Grand Central Station. So, if you did not know there was a speakeasy in Grand Central Station, there you are. The Maniax The reference here is that the name Maniax is lame as hell, but it could have been even lamer. There isn\u2019t a Maniax in DC comics history, but there is a Maniaks. The Maniaks are a fictional rock band modeled off Te Monkees and appeared in four 1967 issues of Showcase. They looked like this. If you click that picture and wonder \u201cgee that guy in the cover looks like Woody Allen,\u201d it\u2019s because that is Woody Allen. For some reason, probably having to do with a substantial amount of drugs, author E. Nelson Bridwell decided The Maniaks needed to interact with the real life Woody Allen. The Death of Sarah Essen So, Gotham actually did it. It killed off a character that, in comics canon, actually grows old and meets an adult Batman. It would have been awkward, though, because comics Sarah Essen is a love interest to Jim Gordon, and Gotham Jim Gordon is super busy dating homicidal murderers and the IRL mother of his child. Strictly talking death, though, Sarah Essen has a terrible track record when it comes to Joker run-ins. In 2000 The Joker murdered Sarah in Detective Comics #741, pictured here in this REALLY, REALLY disturbing comic book panel. Um, is Barbara the Joker?\u00a0 Okay, so\u2026bear with me. I first floated this idea casually after the season one finale. ComicBook.com\u2019s Lucas Siegel posed the question a week ago. It\u2026kind of makes sense. I know Jerome is around, but as a #swerve, there is evidence for Barbara jumping in as a last minute future-Joker. There was her sudden, drastic turn to the homicidal side last season. Then she mocked\u00a0Jim this episode with \u201cYou could always make me laugh!\u201d In the alleyway, after Aaron Helzinger gives Jim a beating, Barbara lands a kiss on Jim\u2019s bleeding forehead. When she sits up, the blood totally resembles sloppily applied red lipstick, underneath a wide, psychotic smile. What I\u2019m saying is \u2014 If the Frank Miller, Dark Knight Returns Joker just happened to be a bisexual blonde woman, he\u2019d rock that exact white jacket and red gloves combo Barbara wore in the GCPD station.", "source": "Observer"}
