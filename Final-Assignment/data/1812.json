The Dow fell 272 points, or 1.7 percent yesterday, while the S&P fell 1.5 percent. \n\nThe jobs report is the last major data about the economy before the Fed\u2019s meeting later this month. \n\nJeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech before the jobs report was released yesterday that it is time to raise rates. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to align our monetary policy with the significant progress we have made\u201d in the economy, Lacker said. \n\nStill, other Fed officials appear to be more cautious because of concerns over international growth and slow inflation. \n\n\u201cIf the decision was made on labor markets alone, this would encourage the Fed to raise interest rates,\u201d said Sara Johnson, senior research director of IHS Global Insight. \n\n\u201cOur view is they will take into account a number of other factors, including international problems and inflation.\u201d", "source": "The Suit Magazine"}
