My Outdoor Alphabet is a series of beautifully designed posters, baby onesies and\u00a0tees that bring to life the language of cyclists, backpackers, alpinists, skiers, and paddlers of all kinds. For example, the cyclist\u2019s alphabet takes you from aero bars to Team Z, with J for jersey, K for kickstand, and M for Musette. There\u2019s a small description at the bottom to fill you in on each one in case you\u2019re stumped. And since I\u2019m not a cyclist, I actually had to look up musette. So. Now I know. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You can grab a beautifully screen printed and signed version of the posters, or a slightly smaller archival print for your kiddo\u2019s room. Or maybe your own. Not that you spend any time in there; surely you\u2019re reading this right now on your phone\u00a0during\u00a0a brief rest after a long portage, which is what P stands for in the Paddler\u2019s Alphabet poster. And yes, I actually did know that one. Find the cool sporty A-Z posters, onesies and more at\u00a0My Outdoor Alphabet\u00a0 \u00a0 No Comments", "source": "Cool Mom Picks"}
