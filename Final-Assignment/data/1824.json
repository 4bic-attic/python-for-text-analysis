Our beautiful, quiet, to ourselves campus was about to be stormed by probably really loud and annoying Americans who knew when to say mail instead of post and romper instead of play suit. The night before they came, I took a walk by myself around campus to just remember what it looked like before some freshmen college kids puked all over it.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2248\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"165\"] All by myself[/caption]\n\nBut come they did. A sea of orange and black, woo girls and lad packs, as well as a vast majority of very lovely and friendly people. In one day everything shifted up a gear. I heard 'oh my god I love your accent are you Australian?' at least 10 times an hour. The gym as suddenly packed with perfect girls with perfect hair (I've discovered everyone's secret is coconut oil).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2249\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"165\"] Pitch invasion[/caption]\n\nThen came class. It really was classes, like being back in secondary school. Registration, whiteboards and homework. Nightmare. Our grade comes from attendance as well as homework and in class quizzes. I'm inclined to think this is utter bull and I should move back to the UK immediately. I also seemed to have accidentally signed up to a political science major that is far more science that politics, with threats of month long data collection hovering over the next week. However, the books I have to read for class are super interesting and stuff i probably would have picked anyway so BONUS.\n\nTomorrow, I start rush week, which is the recruitment week for sororities. I have no idea what to expect, except to expected the unexpected, not the movies....\n\nAll my love, Jas", "source": "JasmineSarahAdams"}
