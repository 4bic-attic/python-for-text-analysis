Set in \u201970s San Francisco, it follows 15 year old Minnie Goetze as she goes from girl to woman at a super high speed after embarking on an affair with her mum\u2019s boyfriend (awks). The best thing about the film? It\u2019s actually believable, and incredibly honest about what it feels like growing up as a young woman which obviously we\u2019re very into. Plus, the sun-soaked retro sets and costumes make the whole thing look like a moving Pinterest board for this season. We caught up with leading lady Bel Powley ahead of the film\u2019s New York premiere to talk teenage memories, London loving and being a secret geek. Tell us about your character, are you alike?\u00a0 I was very earnest like Minnie is, but\u00a0I think she represents every young woman, that butterfly feeling that you get in your stomach. The way you feel when you\u2019re a teenager is so extreme, it\u2019s exhausting. I was so irrational, I\u2019m like how did I survive? How did I live?! You\u2019ve been compared to Carey Mulligan, what actresses do you look up to?\u00a0 There\u2019s so many that I admire but I don\u2019t want to be like anyone else, I want to be my own person. I really admire actresses of older generations who didn\u2019t succumb to the pressures on women in Hollywood, like Francis McDormand and Meryl Streep. Let\u2019s talk about that \u201970s wardrobe\u2026\u00a0 I loved it! It\u2019s so funny because I was wearing all those flares for the film and now it\u2019s out and bell-bottoms are really in, I\u2019m like why didn\u2019t I keep them?! How was shooting in San Francisco? I basically had a tour of the city through shooting. There were so many cool places, I was staying in Potrero Hill which is basically their Hackney \u2013 kind of hipster. The food there is amazing, my favourite restaurant was called Foreign Cinema, it\u2019s so good! Do you prefer the UK or the US?\u00a0 I love coming back to London. I love New York, I love LA, they all have their own amazing qualities but I could never leave London. There\u2019s something about it that just has a sort of grittiness and an edge. We loved the animation in the film\u2026\nIsn\u2019t it amazing? It was all done by an Icelandic animator called Sara Gunnasdottir, she drew every single frame \u2013 her arm nearly fell off! They\u2019re incredible. I just got really good at tracing because I am not good at art! I was better at maths and more rational subjects. If I hadn\u2019t become an actress I was going to study Eastern European history and politics (I know, I am such a geek!). What\u2019s next for you?\u00a0 I\u2019m doing an indie thriller where I play a pole dancer \u2013 which is interesting\u2026 Then I\u2019m doing another period piece called A Storm in Our Stars. My pole dancing costume is the best so far though, it\u2019s literally covered in tassels. \u00a0Want to work \u201970s style yourself?
