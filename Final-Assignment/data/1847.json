Not only is it a complete tick-tock of how the team fell apart, it features a number of quotes and anecdotes from inside the locker room, each one revealing that Matt Williams\u2019s performance as manager was, somehow, even worse than you imagined. \n \nThere\u2019s a lot to be drawn from Svrluga\u2019s story, so you should definitely go read the whole thing , but the biggest revelation is that nobody on the team seems to think much of Williams. \n \nHere\u2019s one anonymous Nationals player talking about Williams\u2019s various strategic missteps : \n  \n   \n\u201cThe first time he does something odd, you\u2019re like, \u2018All right, I see, I get it, I\u2019m with you,\u2019\u201d one Nationals veteran said. \u201cThe next time you\u2019re like, \u2018Ooookay. All right. I\u2019m trying to get it. Yeah.\u2019 And then when it keeps happening, guys are watching him like, \u2018Well, here comes this guy again.\u2019\u201d \n \nNot every manager needs to have Joe Maddon\u2019s ability to inspire confidence in order to be successful, but I\u2019m fairly certain that \u201cWell, here comes this guy again,\u201d is not a thing that many good managers have had said about them by their own players. \n \nIt gets even worse! One of the things consistently brought up to Svrluga by the players he talked to is Williams\u2019s apparent lack of interest in communicating with his players, a source of friction that eventually led to a blowup when Williams failed to inform Jayson Werth that he was going to be out of the lineup one day: \n \nAccording to individuals with direct knowledge of the situation, Werth hadn\u2019t received such a message from Williams. This wasn\u2019t the first time, and Werth wasn\u2019t the first veteran to experience what players considered an oversight once, an egregious error beyond that. \n\nWhat might have been a minor blip in a successful season became a boiling point. Incensed, Werth ripped the lineup card off the wall, bellowing that it was going to change. Then, according to several people who were present, he confronted Williams \u2014 not just about whether he would play that day, but about what most of the clubhouse considered to be a chronic lack of communication with his players. Among the most jarring barbs, from Werth to Williams: \u201cWhen exactly do you think you lost this team?\u201d \n \nReferencing that same confrontation, another player had this to say about Williams: \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s like the guy in his house who hears a sound, like someone breaking in,\u201d one player said. \u201cAnd his reaction isn\u2019t to take care of the problem or investigate. It\u2019s to put his head under the pillow and hope it goes away.\u201d \n \nAbout a year ago, Matt Williams was voted the N.L. Manager of the Year. Since then, he\u2019s presided over the stunning collapse of a team that should have been a lock for the playoffs and transformed himself into baseball\u2019s version of Michael Scott. It\u2019s just too bad we\u2019ll never see what he had in store for next season, because this dude is definitely getting fired. (In fact, how has he not been?) \n \n[ Washington Post ]", "source": "Deadspin"}
