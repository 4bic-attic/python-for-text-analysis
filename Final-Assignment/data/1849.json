Do I have to pay for it? Support Staff 1 Posted by Ethan on 08 Sep, 2015 01:15 PM To share your data between your two desktop systems, you will need to share your main data file between your computers via either a shared local network drive or through an online syncing service. The instructions I'm going to give are for doing this via Dropbox, but you could use any equivalent service. First, you will want to locate your main data file on the desktop version of Moneydance that is most up to date. Assuming that you haven't specified a custom location, your data file will be saved at a location described at http://help.infinitekind.com/kb/moneydance-2015/where-is-my-data-st..., and will be called something like yourfilename.moneydance. You will want to move this file to your Dropbox folder by following the instructions at http://help.infinitekind.com/kb/moneydance-2014/how-to-move-your-da... Once your data file has been moved, reopen Moneydance, use the Open Other option from either the welcome screen or from the menu bar at File -> Open -> Open Other, and select the data file in its new location. If you can now see your data, this computer should now be set up. Make sure that the Dropbox program is running and you are connected to the internet. Moving on to the other computer, assuming that you have Dropbox set up and installed on this computer and either are using the same Dropbox account or have shared the data file with whatever account you are using, you should now be able to see your data file in the Dropbox folder on this computer. Follow the same instructions using the Open Other option in Moneydance to point the program to this file. Your data should now be available on this computer. Moneydance will remember the locations of your data file once you tell it using this 'open other' option, so all of this setup should be a one time event. In the future, you should just have to launch the program, and Moneydance will open the last known location of your data file. If you are using multiple data files, you can quickly switch between them by using the File -> Open menu. It is also important to only have Moneydance open on one of your computers at a time. Otherwise, you will run the risk of one of your computers overwriting the data that the other one is trying to make at the same time. You should get in the habit of completely closing the program when you are not actively using it. Finally, Dropbox uses SSL connections and AES-256 bit encryption to store your data, which provides a high level of security. If you are using a different service, you should check whether they have similar levels of security for your financial data. You can also make your data file more secure by going to File -> Encryption from the Moneydance menu bar to encrypt your data file itself. This will mean that you (or anyone trying to access your data file) will have to enter a password to open it no matter where the data file is stored. Note that we haven't built any 'backdoors' into our encryption, so if you forget your password, we have no way to help you retrieve your data. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance, Ethan\nMoneydance Support Edit Ethan closed this discussion on 08 Sep, 2015 01:15 PM.

I have saved your e mail and will refer it to my IT adviser on Friday. I am 80 years old and ex Quicken getting Moneydance some time back. I have two computers a tower on vista and a lap top now on windows 10, perhaps unwise. The computers share a BT modem infinity. Before I installed the infinity update I used allwaysync to update Moneydance and other files between laptop and tower. That installation downloaded a firewall which blocked the link and I made a cockup of things changing the headings on sync. I am now trying to get things back as they should be. I like moneydance, frankly as an old man I need to keep my assets in one place and am terrified of computer failure. I back up to BT cloud but in the event of failure can I recover from cloud to my laptop or another computer. I dont want my sons saying the silly old sod made a mess of thing if I turn my toes up.
