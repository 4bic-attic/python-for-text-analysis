As I looked through them, I was struck. These two. Just.... wow. They make my mind explode and my heart beat faster.\u00a0 Looking at them, smiling (or not) back at me from this photo, I regretted ever wishing them off to school. But there they are... David and Sam. 4th and 7th. 9 and (nearly) 12. Elementary and Middle. Easy and Complex. Silly and Funny. Sensitive and Emotional. Athletic and Artistic. Yin and Yang. Up and Down. Kid and Tween. Predictable and Unexpected. Heart and Soul. Mine. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Good luck to all you moms, dads, kids and teachers who are beginning another hopeful school year.", "source": "Happie by Abbie: The Blog"}
