Students are no longer sent home for the day unlike in the past. Also, the district no longer performs one-by-one student head checks in the classroom. \n \nThe policy changes are in line with recommendations from the CDC and National Association of School Nurses. If a student has lice, parents are required to follow specific treatment guidelines before the child can return to school\u2013which is usually no more than a day absence. \n \n\u201cNo disease is transmitted it\u2019s considered an annoyance and a nuisance,\u201d Dayton Public Schools Director of Health Services Virginia Noe. \u201cOccasionally, children may have lice and never tell the school so the families pick it up at home and don\u2019t even report it so it\u2019s nice if they do report it so the nurse can make sure they\u2019re following the best guidelines for treatment.\u201d \n \nAnd Noe says that treatment includes using the proper shampoo, examining everyone in the household for the bugs, vacuuming the floor and furniture and temporary packing up any stuffed animals. \n \nFor more on the protocol your school takes to handle lice, you should contact your school district. \n  \nAdvertisement", "source": "WDTN"}
