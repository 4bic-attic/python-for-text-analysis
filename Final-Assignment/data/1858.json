Now if you could combine those two things, then you\u2019d have a blockbuster product right? Yes folks, we now have the world\u2019s first ever Selfie  Spoon, to help you out during those times when you want to eat something and take a picture at the same time. \n \n\n \nThis is actually not a very serious product (at least we hope not), but rather a promotional stunt for Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But it is an actual product that people can get for free, but you just need to pay for the shipping and handling. It really is simple: it is a selfie stick with a spoon at the end of it. If you want to take a picture of yourself while you\u2019re eating, to show off what you\u2019re having for breakfast or any other meal, then you don\u2019t need to use two hands to do it, but just one with this contraption. \n \nThe product may not be serious, but it is functional. It can extend up to 30 inches and even has a remote shutter button just like most selfie sticks, so you don\u2019t need to stretch out your arm. And of course, it has the titular spoon, which you can actually use to eat real food. \n \n\n \nIf you think that such an obviously tongue-in-cheek promotion would not attract people, the fact that it\u2019s free may have escaped your attention. In fact, the first batch that went \u201con sale\u201d last Sunday has already sold out. But the makers of the cereal said that they will be producing and giving away more in the next few days. \n \n \n \nSOURCE: Cinammon Toast Crunch", "source": "Android Community"}
