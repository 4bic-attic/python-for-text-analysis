They are the graphic art-equivalent of Red Cross disaster relief food rations. You and your team \u2014 which you\u2019ll be obsessing over for the next four months \u2014 deserve a better face than some stupid helmet with an even stupider letter on it. That\u2019s stupid. \n \nYou want something that will make your league-mates say things like, \u201cWhat a cool logo, dude!\u201d and \u201cI want one!\u201d and \u201cWow, he\u2019s really gotten his life together!\u201d We can help get them to say the first two by offering up 16 fantasy team names and their corresponding logos, which you can upload to your team\u2019s homepage and proudly display as a battle flag on your quest for that $250 prize. \n \nSome are better than others. (Read: a few suck so bad they\u2019re actually pretty damn good.) \n \nOh, and if you\u2019re still looking for a team name, here\u2019s a running list of the best one\u2019s we\u2019ve found floating around the ol\u2019 internet . Feel free to steal as many as you\u2019d like. (We also have a team name generator, here .) \n  \");\n\t\t}                                                                                                                          js slider         Advertisement", "source": "SportsGrid"}
