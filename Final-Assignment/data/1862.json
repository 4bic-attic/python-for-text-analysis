They want to be close to the event that they're attending or the activity they're wanting to participate in,\" he said.\n\nThe expansion of Docklands has relocated the demographic centre of Melbourne to the west.\n\nMr Burke said that shift was likely to accelerate with the vast bulk of future hotel room development in the Docklands end of town.\n\nHoteliers and developers have moved to exploit the trend.\n\nAt least 2246 rooms are in the development pipeline in the western end of the CBD. In contrast, only 432 are expected to be built in the east, STR Global figures show.\n\nNewer hotel stock can also attract more visitors, a factor working in the west's favour. However, it could also prove difficult for existing operators.\n\n\"It's certainly going to be a bit of a challenge,\" Mr Stickland said.
