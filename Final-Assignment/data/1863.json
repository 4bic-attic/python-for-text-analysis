Instead, Manziel decided to party and drink rather than learn the playbook, and was soundly beaten out by Brian Hoyer to the Browns starting QB. \n \nBut Manziel looked like he was turning his career around, until an elbow injury basically handed the starting job this year to Josh McCown.

I had not had that brought to my attention, so I would be very concerned. His arm never came up when I met with him.\u201d \n \nGruden worked with Manziel in the summer, with the ESPN employee and host of Gruden's QB Camp helping Manziel improve his game ahead of the 2015 season. \n Concerned Coach  \nGruden said that he didn't know anything about any elbow problems with the former Heisman Winner, and the former Oakland Raiders head coach seemed very surprised to learn that Manziel was having to spend time on the sideline. \n \r \n\"Hopefully it's nothing severe, but I'd be very concerned anytime a young quarterback or any quarterback is on the shelf for arm reasons,\" Gruden said. \"I haven't seen that anywhere else in pro football this year.\" \n\r  \nThe elbow problems have prevented Manziel from playing at a time when he was making real progress on the field, showing more maturity off the field and generally being a calmer presence on it, while under center. \n \n\n \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
