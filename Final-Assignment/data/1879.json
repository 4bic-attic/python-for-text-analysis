Even when she explained they weren\u2019t just ordinary baby clothes \u2013 they were designer baby clothes.\n\n\u201cI called up a shelter, and they wouldn\u2019t take them, so I asked them what they wanted. They said new undies,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother shelter she called said they needed sanitary pads, and another needed a pair of closed in work boots.\n\nIt was an eye-opener. The boots were needed as a family was homeless because the father had lost his job and couldn\u2019t afford a pair of work boots that he needed to get a job on road works.\n\n\u201cWe seem to think that what charities need is what we want to donate,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThese charities don\u2019t have a big shed at the back to house the fridge and shed waiting for our donation.\u201d\n\nWith this epiphany, Juliette was determined to help and skimmed from her grocery money, buying new undies, a new pair of boots and sanitary pads. She delivered these to the shelters.\n\n\u201cI felt so good and really connected to the community.\u201d\n\nIt also got her thinking. What if she had a website that matched what charities wanted with what people had ready to donate?\n\n\u201cI spent $500 building a website, and it absolutely failed,\u201d Juliette said.\n\nThe website was not able to remove items from the list once they were donated.\n\n\u201cEvery single person I know said it would fail.\u201d\n\nAnd Juliet was filled with rage - she was not going to give up, so she spent another $900, drew up a contract to ensure what was donated fell off the list, and had another website developed.\n\nSo began GIVIT.\n\nFor the next few weeks, Juliette spent the days glued to her computer, watching for donations that would match charity needs.\n\nThen she would get them together. It eventually came to a head.\n\n\u201cMy husband asked me if I would have the time to buy him some undies, and I said I couldn\u2019t because I was waiting for donations.\u201d\n\nWhen she asked him, why, he pointed to the two-week pile of washing \u2013 mainly his \u2013 pushed in the corner.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018This website is not automatic\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat night, he came home with a bottle of wine and an idea. The virtual warehouse was born.\n\nNow the system works where donations are kept at the donor's place until a person with need selects it. That way, there are no more situations as seen in the Black Friday fires, where 40,000 pallets of donated goods are still in storage.\n\nThese pallets take up more than 50,000 square metres and cost $8 million to store, and no one has the time to sort through.\n\nAs a result of the virtual system, and the fact needs are matched directly with donations, GIVIT now handles national disasters for the Queensland government.\n\nIn 2011, when Queensland was hit by devastating floods, GIVIT had 1.8 million hits resulting in 33,500 goods matched in three weeks.\n\n\u201cCharities can go into the virtual warehouse, and the homeless person sitting with them can choose what they need \u2013 and it is like buying it because it\u2019s their choice.\u201d\n\nBecause people have a sense of control and ownership, they are more likely to look after what has been donated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy how it works. What is essential for one person is completely different for another, so I need to have no judgement.\u201d\n\nNow GIVIT can handle up to eight disasters at one time.\n\nSo far, it has raised over $600,000 for the Ravenshoe disaster, and it is still dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Marcia, where it has made 7500 donations.\n\nNow, Juliette has just launched GIVIT Kids, a safe online platform for children to give new or pre-loved belongings.\n\n\u201cI am doing a drought campaign for the next GIVIT project,\u201d she told her inspired audience.\n\nThe story first appeared on Queensland Country Life.", "source": "The Ararat Advertiser"}
