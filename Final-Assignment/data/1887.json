He liked it and I didn't. He was enormously efficient, used coupons, and made a game out of how much he could save each week. One of the many unsettling moments in the weeks after he died was my going to Wegmans and realizing I had no idea where to find lentils.\n\nHere in Seattle daughter Sara, who travels a lot, gets much of her grocery order delivered by Amazon. That's true of a lot of the young people who live in my building as well. When time is of the essence, you go online and let someone else follow your list , package everything up, and deliver the order right to your door.\n\nNow\u00a0I have time to shop, and I'm a short walk from Pike Place Market and fresh produce year round. I have a favorite vendor, Sosia's, and I enjoy discussing the merits of one kind of tomato over another. It's a very pleasant part of my Saturday morning.\n\nAren't you tempted to reach in and grab one of these? :) They are as luscious as they look.", "source": "Pam Klainer's Day"}
