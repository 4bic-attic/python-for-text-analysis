The only draw came in April 2010 when the sides shared a four-goal thriller. \nLiverpool: Played 4 - Won 3, Lost 0, Drew 1 \n Steve Clarke celebrates with Kenny Daglish after Liverpool beat Everton in the FA Cup semi-final. \n\nClarke moved to Liverpool in January 2010 and had a good record against the Blues while on Merseyside. \n\nThe two teams met four times, with Liverpool never losing to their neighbours. \n\nThe Reds won three, including an FA Cup semi-final, and drew the other of their meetings. \nWest Brom: Played 3 - Won 1, Lost 1, Drew 1 \nThis was Clarke\u2019s first job as a head coach and he enjoyed mixed results against Everton during his spell in charge at the Hawthorns. \n\nHe picked up one victory, a 2-0 success in September 2012, and then had a draw and a defeat in his other two games against the Blues. \n Steve Clarke's record v Everton", "source": "Reading Post"}
