Source: DailyTelegraph \n\nThe Daily Telegraph this morning purchased a Hayne #38 jersey \u2014 for the bargain price of US$99.95 before tax \u2014 from the club\u2019s main retail outlet at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nUntil now, the only way fans could buy a Hayne jersey was to go online, or into stores, and have one specifically made to order.\n\nHAYNE HUB: MORE JARRYD HAYNE NEWS \n\nIndeed, only last week it was suggested neither Nike or the 49ers would put Hayne merchandise \u2018on the rack\u2019 until the 27-year-old superstar had made the 53-man roster.\n\nYet so staggering is the desire for gear bearing the name of the Australian cult figure, the 49ers have this week taken the extraordinary step of putting a range in their stores prior to the final pre-season game against San Diego.\n\nIndeed, in the few minutes it took us to take pictures of the #38 jersey on sale, a staffer came and grabbed two off the rack to put on hold behind the counter.\n\nAsked about the demand, she said: \u201cOh, this guy sure is hot. Source: Supplied \u201cEvery time I pick up the phone people are saying \u2018Have you got Hayne, have you got Hayne?\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nOnline, the 49ers price for a customised Hayne jersey remains US$99.95. However to have one made here at Levi\u2019s Stadium costs US$149.95.\n\nHowever, with interest in the Aussie now teetering on chaotic, and the franchise playing San Diego at home Thursday, club officials have decided to try and help meet the demand.\n\nA store manager said he was unable to say exactly how many Hayne jerseys had been made available in-store or whether more would be produced prior to the Chargers game.\n\nHowever, The Daily Telegraph understands the current batch were only put out over the weekend, when the team was playing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.\n\nCertainly, the decision to sit Hayne\u2019s jersey beside that of Kaepernick \u2014 in the official team store, no less \u2014 is staggering when you consider the Sydneysider is yet to be guaranteed a contract.

However, should Hayne make the cut Nike are ready to mass produce a variety of jerseys with his name and number.\n\nThey will also consider other \u2018accessories\u2019 such as caps and T-shirts.\n\nThe find comes only a day after 49ers coach Jim Tomsula said he had already \u201cseen what I need to see\u201d in terms of Hayne as a punt returner.", "source": "NEWS.com.au"}
