Call me crazy, my husband already thinks so, how giddy with joy I was when I saw the yoga area at DFW (airport code listed to impress you, dear husband\u00a0). After a sitting on a plane and emerging with stiffness and aches of pains this is a place where I can decompress and take care of \u201cME\u201d in between flights. You guys can take the fancy lounges, this is my happy place. The studio is located between the B and D terminals, in a walkway near gate D40. \u00a0DFW is a really big airport, so you may need to take the train or ask one of the info volunteers for directions on how to find your way there. Once there, only a partition separates you from the stressful hustle and bustle of air travel and enjoying a moment enjoying a peaceful Savasana. It\u2019s not the most private relaxation area I\u2019ve ever done yoga in, but the hallway was pretty empty. \u00a0This fully equipped studio (not that you need much for yoga) includes mats and hand sanitizer. You do\u00a0need to bring your you own yoga pants. \u00a0Better yet, just wear them on the plane so your comfortable. \u00a0There was nobody in the studio when I showed up, so I had it all to myself. There was a television that seemed to play videos on a continuous loop. \u00a0The picture quality was pretty bad and the video was definitely a bit, well, dated. \u00a0A better choice here is to bring your own app. Sworkit,\u00a0which I reviewed last week, includes a yoga option of sun salutations, basic stretches or you can create\u00a0your own on your flight so it\u2019s ready when you land. \u00a0I\u2019ll also be reviewing another app focused solely on Yoga shortly. DFW isn\u2019t the only airport with yoga. \u00a0You can see pictures and descriptions of yoga areas in Chicago O\u2019Hare, Burlington VT, San Francisco and Helsinki in this article. I also found yoga areas\u00a0at Albuquerque International Sunport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport. I\u2019ll keep searching to find more and update my list for the future!", "source": "BoardingArea"}
