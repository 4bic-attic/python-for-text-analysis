Left with little scratches but mostly a bruised ego #ohwell,\u201d she wrote. \n\nThe model, sporting nearly unrecognizable bleached eyebrows, wore a lace dress and shows with lots of fringes on them, which appeared to cause her fall. Fortunately a couple of audience members quickly helped her to her feet and she went on to finish the show. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one to fall either. The show was held at New York City\u2019s Pier 26 and the runway was concrete, hence Candice\u2019s cuts, and had a series of wooden pallets stacked like steps for the models to climb over. One model got tripped up on her shoes also but managed to avoid falling on the concrete as some quick members of the audience were able to grab her and help her up as she slipped going down the makeshift steps. \n\nNote to Givenchy: walking around with untied shoes is not fashion, it\u2019s just stupid. \n\nClick here to read full story \u00bb", "source": "NASH FM 102.5"}
