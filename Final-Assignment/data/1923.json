My \u201ccheck engine\u201d light had come on, a persistent yellow glow on my dashboard that demanded attention before I could continue my biweekly Wegmans runs. I dropped the car off (hold on, let me get the sweaty socks and granola bar wrappers out) and left on my bike, figuring \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that it\u2019d be an hour or so before they called me back in. \n \nAfter coming to terms with to the fact that I would spend my day biking around town searching for a stronger Wi-fi signal, I wound up at Barnes & Noble, my childhood mecca for all things fact and fiction. I wandered the aisles with no agenda, delighting in the idea that the employees would shelve the Kama Sutra in the \u201cLiving Your Best Life\u201d section and stopping to flip through the cookbooks. I like to circle the store, nabbing titles that pique my interest, and I ended up by the daily planners, where it is quiet and I am left virtually alone to peruse my selections. \n \nI had picked up a book called \u201cGood Poems,\u201d a massive collection of the poetry read by Garrison Keillor on the radio every morning. My experience with poetry stops with the third grade state test \u2014 I don\u2019t read too much of it, and I get upset when it doesn\u2019t rhyme. As I skimmed through a couple of the poems, names like Thoreau and Dickinson jumped off the page. Holding the book felt so adult, so scholarly \u2014 and because \u2018Scholarly Ivy Leaguer\u2019 is my day job, I bought it. To date, I\u2019ve read about eight of the poems. The book sits on my nightstand, glaring at me; It wants me to further my poetic education instead of rewatching Parks and Recreation for the umpteenth time. I started to wonder: Did I buy the book because I had the sudden urge to read poems, or because I wanted to be somebody that reads poetry? \n \nSpoiler: It\u2019s the latter. I wanted to be caught examining those lengthy stanzas; to appear brainy, like someone who spends her free time turning the cogs of her brain rather than turning the radio up on her way to get Thai food. To some extent, I did enjoy the poetry. But its purchase was a thinly veiled attempt to brand myself as an intellectual. Exactly how much of what we do is an effort to become something we believe we should be? How much of our lives do we spend biting our bottom lips through things we don\u2019t find fun in an effort to maintain an image in our own minds? I think we all strive to keep up certain appearances in the name of viewing ourselves as athletic or effortlessly popular or tolerant of a level of alcohol that in truth makes us cringe. It\u2019s that old American ideal \u2014 fake it \u2019til you make it. \n \nOf course, far be it from me to decry those who own yoga pants without actually practicing yoga \u2014 it\u2019s like wearing a cloud. But ever since that poetry book, there\u2019s been an annoying voice in the back of my head (one that sounds eerily akin to the genie in Aladdin). Am I only part of a pre-law frat because I want to say I\u2019m taking the bar? Do I do keep a shelf of classic novels because I want to slyly reference Hemingway in conversation? Am I nodding at cultural references I don\u2019t understand to avoid people discovering that I grew up without cable television? \n \nI don\u2019t mean to suggest that everything we do has an ulterior motive \u2014 quite the opposite. But I think there are small things hidden in the corners of our lives that we always wanted to be, and aren\u2019t yet. That poetry tome, for all its quiet mocking, informed an excellent point \u2014 instead of choosing the qualities you want like candy out of a vending machine, you ought to be focusing on what you do for yourself and nobody else. In my mind, there lies happiness. \n \nPeople who live authentically are rare, and you can spot them a mile away. They don\u2019t profess who they are \u2014 they don\u2019t have to. These people are content with simple internal validation. Often they aren\u2019t dressed the part; They do yoga without the tell-tale yoga pants. Maybe someday I will stop buying books to appear more bookish, but for now, I\u2019m going to set a reminder every night before bed. Because I\u2019m finishing that poetry book, one verse at a time. \n \nRuth Weissmann is a junior in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. He can be reached at raw287@cornell.edu.
