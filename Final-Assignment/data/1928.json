The Sunday Times newspaper reported that the rent for the refugees will be paid for by charitable funds under the archbishop\u2019s personal control. \n \nWelby has been critical of Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s recent offer to take in an extra 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years, calling it a \u201cvery slim response.\u201d \n \nThe archbishop lives with his family on the top floor of the palace and this month opened up the rest of the building to a new community of young Christians from around the world. Lambeth Palace dates back to the 15th century, lies on the south bank of\u00a0 River Thames. \n  POST YOUR COMMENTS", "source": "New Delhi Pioneer"}
