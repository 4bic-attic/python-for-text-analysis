Like any great showdown, the matchup between Bret Bielema and Kingsbury brings a clear good-evil dichotomy. With his utopian brand of football, uncanny resemblance to beloved actor Ryan Gosling, and popularity with the kids, Kingsbury represents the side of righteousness and light. Meanwhile, Bielema is an unapologetic troll whose face is chiseled onto the Mt. Rushmore of odious FBS coaches. His chief redeeming quality might be his candor. Naturally, Bielema\u2019s reputation made Toledo\u2019s shocking Week 2 upset of Arkansas rife with schadenfreude for the neutral observer \u2014 especially on the heels of Bielema\u2019s accurate but irrelevant complaints about Ohio State\u2019s schedule, which smacked of sour grapes.1 As a result, jokes about the Head Hog have abounded IRL and on Twitter in recent days. Even Rex Ryan got in on the action: #Bills coach Rex Ryan with a solid shot at Bret Bielema. pic.twitter.com/dfqZCvVjlx \u2014 Zach Heilprin (@ZachHeilprin) September 16, 2015 It wasn\u2019t always this way. In terms of public perception, Bielema\u2019s head-coaching career began auspiciously enough, with the former Iowa nose guard first making waves back in 2006, during his rookie campaign helming the Badgers. The NCAA had just instituted a dumb, ill-advised rule that required (among other things) the clock to start as soon as the ball was kicked off, not when it was received, which was ridiculous for a whole slew of reasons \u2014 primarily because it artificially shortened college football games, and who in their right mind would want less college football? This rule was unceremoniously discarded after one season, in part because Bielema had exploited it so ingeniously in a November game against Penn State. With 23 seconds left in the first half and the Badgers set to kick off, Bielema instructed his players to intentionally go offside twice, thus reducing the amount of time the Nittany Lions had to mount a drive before halftime. Joe Paterno was FURIOUS, but there was nothing the officials could do but shrug their shoulders and point to the rulebook. It\u2019s a damn shame that video of this incident has been removed from YouTube. Initially, Bielema was lauded for exposing Rule 3-2-5-e as a sham. He was sticking it to the establishment, and as we all know, there aren\u2019t many establishments more loathsome than the NCAA. In retrospect, though, it\u2019s fair to wonder if Bielema\u2019s motives were less altruistic than plain evil; maybe he got off on bullying his easily agitated peer. To quote noted college football guru Stephanie Tanner: How rude! Bielema\u2019s standing as a bully became more evident over time, most notably when he went for a two-point conversion at the end of a blowout win over Minnesota in 2010, a wholly unnecessary move that led to a postgame dust-up with then\u2013Golden Gophers coach Tim Brewster: Listen to Bielema try in vain to defend such a monstrously wicked decision. That right there is the voice of a coaching sociopath, ladies and gentlemen. Want more proof? Later that season, the Badgers posted a preposterous 83 points on Indiana, the poverty-stricken child of college football teams. Hilariously, Bielema proceeded to make an appearance on Mike and Mike in an ill-fated attempt at damage control, but no one was buying the \u201cWho, me?\u201d routine. At least Woody Hayes had the decency to run up the score on good teams. In 2012, Bielema criticized new Ohio State coach Urban Meyer\u2019s widely practiced method of attempting to \u201cflip\u201d recruits, famously declaring that \u201cWe at the Big Ten don\u2019t want to be like the SEC \u2014 in any way, shape, or form.\u201d Bielema would infamously end up bolting for Arkansas less than a year later, where he presumably remains insecure that Meyer is a far better recruiter. At Arkansas, Bielema fully blossomed into the grade-A troll that he is today. He\u2019s feuded with too many SEC coaches to name, generally due to his self-serving and baseless contention that hurry-up offenses pose a serious player-safety risk. However, it was his wife, Jen, who caused his greatest controversy to date with the Razorbacks. As you surely remember, Wisconsin got utterly jobbed by the notoriously awful Pac-12 officials in a 2013 game against Arizona State \u2014 so much so that the refs faced sanctions afterward: That\u2019s not how Jen saw it, though. On the contrary, Jen genuinely believed that Badgers fans were receiving a well-deserved dose of karmic retribution from the football gods, apparently because they weren\u2019t pleased with the way Bert handled his departure from Wisconsin. While she quickly deleted this tweet, #karma has lived on as a meme in the college football Twittersphere, and it never gets old. In fact, it started trending in Columbus, of all places, moments after Toledo sealed its 16-12 upset of the Razorbacks. Jen\u2019s mentions have been a sight\u00a0to behold over the past few days. So, when Arkansas takes on Texas Tech on Saturday in a must-win game for Bielema, remember that it is your moral duty as a discerning college football fan to root for Kingsbury\u2019s Red Raiders, your imperative to root against Bielema and his bullying ways. Bert is many things: a frat bro who never grew up, a troll with a persecution complex, and an opportunistic propagandist, and he deserves your scorn. If Bert wanted to face a Big Ten schedule, he should have stayed at Wisconsin! Nobody forced him to move to Fayetteville.\tFiled Under: College Football, Bret Bielema, Arkansas Razorbacks, Wisconsin Badgers, Urban Meyer, Ohio State Buckeyes, Big Ten, SEC, Toledo Rockets, trolls, College Football Recruiting, College Football Coaches, NCAA, NCAAF, Football, Matt Borcas Matt Borcas is a contributing writer\u00a0for Grantland.
