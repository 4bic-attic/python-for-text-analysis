When reasonable people drop out the climate is bound to change and it's seldom a positive change.\u00a0\nLL\nHow many though have dropped out because it was no longer worth it to them any longer. \u00a0It's kind of a chicken and egg question.\u00a0 -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Atheism vs Christianity\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to atheism-vs-christianity+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/atheism-vs-christianity.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.", "source": "Atheism Versus Christianity"}
