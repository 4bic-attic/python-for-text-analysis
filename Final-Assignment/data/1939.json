Robert Long, left, and Rachael Hampton appear in Douglas County District Court, Thursday, June 4, 2015. Caleb Chrisman, 22, is charged with Long and Hampton in the Feb. 8 shootings of three men \u2014 two of them Kansas University students \u2014 in a central Lawrence home. The shootings allegedly happened as Chrisman helped Long rob a KU student known to sell illegal drugs.\n\nAs part of a plea deal, Chrisman testified Thursday for the prosecution at Hampton and Long\u2019s joint preliminary hearing. In exchange for his testimony, prosecutors agreed to drop Chrisman\u2019s three charges of aggravated kidnapping, leaving him with just two charges of aggravated robbery and one aggravated burglary charge.\n\nIn his testimony, Chrisman said Long and Hampton came to his Blue Springs, Mo., home the morning of the shooting to \u201chang out\u201d when Long asked him to help with a robbery.\n\n\u201c(Long) needed money and him and Rachael needed to go on the run,\u201d Chrisman said. \u201cRobert had an upcoming court date. He had just lost his job.\u201d\n\nAccording to Douglas County District Court records, Chrisman failed to appear for a sentencing hearing Feb. 17 after pleading guilty to one count of felony attempt to elude a police officer. \n\nChrisman said that although Hampton and Long had been dating only \u201ca few weeks,\u201d Long told him Rachael was a \u201crider\u201d \u2014 a colloquialism for \u201cride or die,\u201d meaning loyal to the end.\n\n\u201c(Long) made it obvious they were going to do it with or without me,\u201d Chrisman said.\n\nLater that day, Chrisman said that he told Long he would go with them to Hampton\u2019s Lawrence apartment, bringing a gun with him at Long\u2019s request. Hampton then drove the two to her apartment, where Chrisman said Long began convincing him to help with the robbery.\n\nAfterward, Long allegedly sold some \u201cmolly,\u201d or MDMA, to two customers, then had Hampton drive them to Wal-Mart so Long could show Chrisman how \u201ceasy\u201d it is to rob someone, Chrisman claimed. There, a man got into Hampton\u2019s car to buy drugs from Long, but Long and Chrisman pulled guns on him, taking $100, a wallet and an iPhone from the victim, Chrisman said.\n\nAfter the robbery, the victim was let go, Chrisman said. Long then had Hampton drive him and Chrisman to 1621 W. 19th Terrace, where two of the victims \u00ac\u2013 Phillip Hawley and Seth Peterson \u00ac\u2013 lived at the time.\n\nFirst, Long went in to buy Xanax from Hawley so he could leave the home\u2019s back door unlocked as he left, Chrisman said. After some time, Long and Chrisman got out of Hampton\u2019s car with guns and went down to the basement where Hawley and friend Arthur \u201cC.J.\u201d Perez were studying for an economics exam. Hampton was directed to circle the block and be the getaway car, Chrisman said.\n\nInside, Chrisman said Long demanded cash and drugs from the victims, and a third person \u2014 Peterson \u2014 came down to the basement. Chrisman said he told Peterson to get on the ground, and when he refused, Chrisman pistol-whipped Peterson two or three times in the head.\n\nDuring the altercation, Chrisman said Long began shooting at the victims, ultimately striking Hawley in the ear and neck area, Perez in the buttocks and Peterson in the arm. Later, Long would allegedly pull Hawley into a bedroom to take Hawley\u2019s cash and marijuana, marijuana concentrates and \u201cpills,\u201d Hawley testified Wednesday.\n\nAfter Long had taken the items from Hawley, he allegedly shot Hawley in the back, puncturing a lung, Hawley said. \n\nWhen Chrisman and Long left the home, Chrisman said Hampton was nowhere to be found. The two then ran north onto the KU campus. Chrisman said he eventually stopped in the yard of a \u201cbig white house with a chain-link fence\u201d and called Hampton. She later picked up Chrisman and Long, Chrisman said.\n\nChrisman said the three then went back to his house in Missouri, and Hampton and Chrisman left the day after. Chrisman said Long believed he\u2019d killed Hawley and was \u201clooking at life (in prison,)\u201d so Long would shoot any police officer who tried to pull them over as they fled.\n\n\u201c(Long said he was) going to need the (guns) to pave the way so that he and Rachael could start a new life together,\u201d Chrisman said.\n\nLong and Hampton were found and arrested in Las Vegas in March after spending a month on the run.\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s testimony, Douglas County District Judge Kay Huff bound Long over on aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery and two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Long is also charged with three counts of aggravated kidnapping and attempted first-degree murder, but Huff is taking those charges under advisement.\n\nHuff found that there was probable cause to bind Hampton over on charges of aiding and abetting aggravated burglary and two counts of aggravated robbery. Hampton is also charged with aiding and abetting Long\u2019s three aggravated kidnapping charges, but Huff took those charges under advisement as well.\n\nThough Huff has not yet found probable cause in the aggravated kidnapping charges on both Hampton and Long, she did find probable cause for kidnappings\u2019 alternative charges of aggravated battery. \n\nHuff will announce her decision at Hampton and Long\u2019s arraignment Oct. 30. Chrisman is expected to appear next in court on Tuesday. We strive to uphold our values for every story published.", "source": "Lawrence Journal-World"}
