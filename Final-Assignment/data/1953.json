Let\u2019s take a look at how my pregnancy\u2019s going. Here are my previous updates:\u00a0weeks 1-7, weeks 8-12,\u00a0weeks 13-16, and weeks 17-20. We\u2019ll start with a bump pic\u2026 Weight Gained: By 20 weeks I gained 11 lbs total. Wk 21= +0 lbs, Wk 22= +2 lbs, Wk 23= +1 lb, Wk 24= +0 lb. So by week 24 I gained 14 lbs total. Symptoms:\u00a0I tend to over heat more easily. I\u2019ve noticed I get much sweatier than normal in body pump. TMI- I also get constipated regularly and only poop (hey, everyone does it!) every few days. For me, that\u2019s out of the norm. I was a regular once-a-day-er, haha. My feet and belly seem to be more swollen/bigger by the end of the day. Nothing crazy or uncomfortable, just noticeable. Food Cravings/Aversions:\u00a0Again this update, nothing out of the ordinary. I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on my sugars and only indulging once a week (although I tend to over indulge), and that doesn\u2019t even include froyo/soft serve ;) Good news though, I passed my glucose test! I\u2019ve been eating a lot of nut butters and nuts in general. I tend to keep dipping the spoon in the jar or my hand in the container. Misc: I bought some new workout clothes that fit better. I never liked tight tops when running, but now I\u2019m all about them to show off my bump! \u00a0My\u00a0mom got me\u00a0some work pants that I really like.\u00a0I won this Mud Love bracelet from Carlee\u2019s Blog. I got to pick which word I wanted off a list and I went with \u201cfamily\u201d because a) family is everything b) my family is always there for me and c) I\u2019m starting my own family. All good things to remember and think about throughout the day. Workouts:\u00a0Took things easy after my big race\u00a0last Sunday\u00a0;) J/K, it was only a 5k. This week was the same as most. I\u2019m just happy to be able to run still <3 Mon\u2013 Rest\nTues\u2013 1 m walk on tread/ Body Pump\nWed\u2013\u00a04m on tread @ 9:22 pace\nThurs\u2013 1.5\u00a0m walk on tread/ Body Pump\nFri\u2013 4m on tread @ 9:15\u00a0pace\nSat\u2013 Body Pump\nSun\u2013 1 hr on the\u00a0Elliptical This bruise from the glucose test was especially fun to show off at body pump. My veins are full and plump, but small, so I almost always bruise after giving blood. It was really fun when I had to give blood every few days for a month for the IUI. Hopefully people don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing drugs while pregnant, haha. I doubt they do. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll look good on the elliptical on Sunday, too when my arm stretches out holding the handles (or whatever they\u2019re called.)\u00a0Linking up with Erin\u00a0for my weekend snapshot. Do you bruise easily after giving blood?
