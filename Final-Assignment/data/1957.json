The main purpose of this paper is to study the existence of ground state solutions for the aforementioned system with a nonlinearity in the critical growth under some suitable assumptions on V and F . Recent results from the literature are improved and extended. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "source": "Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences"}
