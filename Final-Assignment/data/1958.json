This means that in order for a panel to receive as much sunlight as possible, it has to pan with the sun as it moves across the sky. While there are motorized assemblies designed to do just that, they add complexity, weight and expense to photovoltaic systems. Now, however, University of Michigan scientists have developed a simpler alternative \u2013 and it's based on the ancient Japanese cut-paper art of kirigami.\n\nThe U Michigan engineers consulted with Matthew Shlian, a paper artist who also lectures at the university's School of Art and Design. He showed them a kirigami pattern that would suite their purposes...\n\nRead more at http://www.gizmag.com/kirigami-sun-tracking-solar-cells/39339/ from an article by Ben Coxworth.\nBelow it is a video shows how the Kirigami solar panel works:\nhttps://youtu.be/BSO91d6ryHY\nYouTube video Michigan Engineering", "source": "For Good News"}
