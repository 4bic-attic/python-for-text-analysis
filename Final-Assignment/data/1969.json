In that sense this entire drama is a grave mockery of the constitution itself\u201d. \n \nHe said people of this country have not voted for the RSS. The BJP clearly has neither the autonomy nor the permission to govern the country. The people of India have been taken for a ride. \n \nThe Prime Minister and his colleagues in the Government are functioning as per whims of an organization whose violent and intolerant ideology killed Mahatma Gandhi, and it is not surprising thus that this Government has, in line with its masters in the RSS, unleashed a divisive, anti people and fascist agenda on the country. \n \nHe advised the PM to realize that his reporting, appraisal and accountability lies with the people of India, people who are being continuously short changed, exploited and repressed by him and his Government. \n \nSurjewala also condemned the government for trying to subvert and dilute the essential spirit and character of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML). \n \nDevoid of any legacy that comprises of the building of our nation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) & the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are playing a diabolical game of rewriting and misappropriating our rich and proud heritage of struggle for Independence, he added. \n \n\u201cAny attempts by the BJP, the RSS and Shri Narendra Modi to diminish and downplay\u00a0 the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of\u00a0 Independent India and one of the greatest sons of the country is not going to hold water with the people of our country,\u201d he warned. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u2013Courtesy \u201cMuslim Mirror\u201d \n \nThe post appeared first on The Siasat Daily .", "source": "Siasat Daily"}
