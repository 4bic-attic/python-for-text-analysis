It\u2019s the emotional loss of their partner.\"  \n\r Houston TX (PRWEB) \r September 17, 2015 \r \n\nMenopause is no longer just for \u2018older women\u2019 with hot flashes, irritability and night sweats.  An estimated 6,000 baby boomer women in the U.S. reach menopause every day and suffer both physical and emotional symptoms that can linger and interfere with their relationships and marriages.  Hesitant to share her new emotions with her husband, divorce sometimes ensues. \n \n\u201cMen often wonder why she rejects him in the bedroom, why she doesn\u2019t want to go out as much, and why she seems colder, more anxious and feels old, unattractive, overweight, tired,  overwhelmed and confused or depressed,\u201d says  Mary Jo Rapini, a licensed psychotherapist and co-author of newly published, Re-Coupling: A Couple\u2019s 4-step Guide to Greater Intimacy and Better Sex. \u201cWhile menopause affects women physically, it\u2019s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved. It\u2019s the emotional loss of their partner. He sees her as still being beautiful, witty, charming, sexy and his main confidante\u2019. Anyone who has ever tried to tell a woman she is beautiful when she believes she is not understands how futile it is and how easily she will dismiss the comment even if it was said with sincerity.\u201d \n \nThese 10 tips help couples cope with the change and can even draw one another closer: \n \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t take menopause symptoms personally.\r \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explore new ways to be intimate, the ones you traditionally used may not be comfortable anymore.\r \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she\u2019s most irritable or angry ask her what\u2019s going on--it most likely has nothing to do with you.\r \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there\u2019s a problem, don\u2019t ignore it--talk about it. \r \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If she\u2019s having hot flashes, cuddling or sleeping together might be too uncomfortable.

Be patient, listen and don\u2019t make jokes.\r \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are no quick medical treatments available for the physical or emotional aspects as helpful as a loving, supportive partner. Hormone therapy helps, but it isn\u2019t a magic cure, and many women cannot use it. \r \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If sex is being avoided, it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love you anymore. It might be painful. Replens is a non-hormonal moisturizer that provides comfortable relief for three days and a good silicone lubricant like Wet Platinum or Replens Silky Smooth should be used just before and during sex. \r \n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifty is a tough time for men too, so be patient with one another. Mid-life is a couple\u2019s challenge. Many men are silently suffering from erectile dysfunction. Stronvivo is a nutritional supplement that improves blood flow and erectile function by keeping blood circulating smoothly throughout the body, delivering nutrients and oxygen to the brain, muscles, organs, and skin. Natural pharmaceutical-grade ingredients including L-Arginine and L-Citrulline among others to support healthy hormone levels resulting in stronger erections for men making it a perfect companion to testosterone replacement therapy and increased sexual desire for women enhancing lubrication, arousal and orgasms while reducing vaginal pain.\r \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depression and anxiety can be part of menopause. Take it seriously and encourage her to talk to a mental health care professional if her symptoms become severe or persistent. \r \n\u201cCouples who embrace the change in life as a temporary condition and go through it together do much better and remain much closer than those who don\u2019t,\u201d adds Rapini. \n  \nShare article on social media or email", "source": "PRWeb"}
