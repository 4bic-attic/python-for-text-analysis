Well, number four just took place (September 27 or 28, depending on where you live) and nothing happened! That\u2019s right. Nothing. \n \nJohn Hagee (author of \u201cFour Blood Moons\u201d) has been promoting a theory that God is sending signs in the skies that may precede the second coming of Jesus. Hagee says we are the last generation, and that God is sending signs to indicate that \u201c\u2026we\u2019re going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world.\u201d \n \nWell, four blood moons have come and gone and nothing happened. \n \nWhat is a blood moon? it is a total eclipse of the moon\u2013a lunar eclipse, where the earth blocks the direct light of the sun from reaching the moon. The moon sits in the earth\u2019s shadow. During a total lunar eclipse the moon appears red because indirect light from the sun passing through the earth\u2019s atmosphere takes on a red hue and illuminates the moon. There is no blood on the moon. \n \nBlood moons are not rare at all. We get two of them every year. They often fall on Jewish holidays because of the way the Jewish calendar works. Sometimes it happens that four consecutive eclipses fall on Jewish holidays. And that\u2019s what all the hype is about. When that happens, eclipses in the spring occur on Passover; the fall eclipses occur on the Feast of Tabernacles. That\u2019s it. \n \nAre blood moons related to Bible prophecy. Not at all. Though that is what Hagee and others claim. Hagee says that every time four blood moons fall on Jewish holidays, something significant happens. But the historical record will not vindicate that claim. \n \nWhat about Bible passages that speak of \u201cthe moon being turned into blood\u201d? Don\u2019t those texts indicate something significant connected with the blood moons? No. The three texts ( Joel 2:28-32 , Acts 2:16-2 1 Revelation 6:12-13 ) have to do with judgments of God against sin. Those judgments took place long ago. \n \nThose texts were not about lunar eclipses, but were about the darkness associated with judgments of God. For more on this kind of highly dramatic figurative language, read Isaiah 13:1-10 and Ezekiel 32:1-11 . Those texts speak of God\u2019s judgments on Babylon and Egypt. Those, too, have already taken place. \n \nA FINAL WORD \n \nFolks often ask me, \u201cWhat about signs that tell us when Jesus is coming back?\u201d \n \nSorry, there are no such signs in the Bible. Jesus said this in Matthew 24:36 \u2026 \n \n\u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.\u201d \n \nNote that Jesus said that even He did not know. Hagee doesn\u2019t know. John Hagee is a false teacher. You and I don\u2019t know when Jesus will return. Just be ready. \n \n\u2013Max \n \nFYI: My presentation on \u201cBlood Moons\u201d can be viewed online @ dowlenroad.com.
