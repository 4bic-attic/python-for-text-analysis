Working in assembly-line fashion, from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., employee volunteers will gather in shifts on the plaza outside Minnesota Power\u2019s General Office Building in Duluth to package toothbrushes, healthy snacks, warm socks and laundry soap for several nonprofit organizations that serve children and families in the region. The simple act of assembling a snack pack or dental kit is a big help to nonprofits that often can use an extra hand. By the end of the 2\u00bd hour \u201cPower Volunteering on the Plaza,\u201d Minnesota Power employees will have packaged hundreds of packs and kits for four nonprofits: . Just Kids Dental. Assemble dental supply kits for youths to be distributed at schools. . YWCA Duluth. Create healthy snack packs to be distributed to children in after-school programs. . Lifehouse. Package socks and toe warmers to give to low-income and homeless teens. . CHUM. Package bulk laundry soap into smaller containers to be distributed to families visiting the food shelf or who are in transitional housing. \u201cPower Volunteering on the Plaza\u201d is part of the company\u2019s payroll pledge campaign for Head of the Lakes United Way. It is the second consecutive year Minnesota Power has held the event.", "source": "The Howie Blog"}
