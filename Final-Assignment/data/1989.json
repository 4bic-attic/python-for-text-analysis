As new political appointees come in, they often meet resistance\u00a0to their\u00a0ideas\u00a0from federal government lifers, some new recruits say.\u00a0\r\u201cThere\u2019s this what I call scar tissue between that level and the actual bureaucracy,\u201d\u00a0said Greg Godbout, chief technology officer at the Environmental Protection Agency, during a Sept. 15 AFCEA Bethesda panel discussion\u00a0about emerging technologies. \u201cAnd you can imagine if you work within that bureaucracy for decades, yes, someone is always going to come in with some new thing, a change, and you build up an immunity to new ideas.\u201d\rFor years, the government has not\u00a0changed its methodologies to take advantage of new technologies, so even as new tech comes in, the processes to work around them remain the same, Godbout\u00a0said.\rThe key to the future is not\u00a0recreating legacy systems, he said, but creating an\u00a0ecosystem \u201cso we\u2019re no longer ever building legacy systems.\u201d\r\u201cYou have to build culture first and that\u2019s really the difficult part in government,\u201d Godbout added. \"You\u2019ve got to sort of tear up that scar \u2026 and say, \u2018We need you to be open to learning and changing yourself and build on that internally and continuously.\u201d\rTo \u201cunhinge\u201d that culture, Godbout said, \u201cwe have to accept risks and really embrace the small failures that we can learn from.\u201d\rChange to that risk averse environment starts at the top, said Rafael Diaz, chief information officer at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Leaders have to help guide their staff \u201cthrough change and uncertainty, and guide them through what they don\u2019t understand,\u201d he added.\r\u201cSomeone has to say, \u201cThis is where we\u2019re going, this is why we\u2019re going there and this is how we\u2019re going to get there,\u2019\u201d Diaz said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have that laid out for somebody who doesn't understand, they\u2019re going to want to keep doing what they\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\rDavid Bray, CIO at the Federal Communications Commission, objected to the scar tissue analogy. He\u00a0said the federal government is populated by people eager to transform the government. Many are \u201chungry and desperate\u201d for a change, but they haven\u2019t been empowered to make real changes, he added.\rGodbout said the status quo doesn\u2019t occur just because of lack of empowerment. That \u201cangst of change\u201d is \u201cvery difficult\u201d and something he said he sees often at his own agency. As the federal government doesn\u2019t have a profit motive like commercial entities, \u201cultimately, your job is to deliver,\" he said. In that type of environment, it\u2019s hard to discern what\u2019s positive change or just part of someone\u2019s legacy, he added.\rBut what does disrupt the status quo is someone willing to take risks -- and all the blame when something goes wrong. Bray calls that role \u201cthe human flack jacket.\"\u00a0Godbout agreed, saying that mindset is\u00a0key to transformation.\r\u201cThere needs to be leadership in that organization that is willing to take the blame, that is willing to say, \u201cIt\u2019s on me. Don\u2019t worry; I told you to do this. I\u2019ll take the risk,\u2019\u201d Godbout said. \u201cAnd I think that element -- \u2018I\u2019ll take the risk\u2019 -- is part of every moving-forward experience I\u2019ve experienced in government.\u201d\r(Image via\u00a0Lightspring/\u00a0Shutterstock.com)\rrecommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Step Inside the Digital Agency Enable Workforce Collaboration Sign Up for Government Rewritten Raise Your Agency's Energy I.Q. sponsored Get Smart.
