According to \u201cReal Goals to Improve the Developing World,\u201d a paper by Iain Murray of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) released today, true help for developing countries is about building resiliency. Contrary to the United Nation\u2019s Agenda for Sustainable Development, CEI outlines five proven ways to reduce the impact of extreme events such as weather or disease on the poorest in the world by delivering real prosperity. \n\n\u201cDeveloping countries should adopt certain strategies that are proven to work to deliver a healthier, greener, more prosperous planet \u2013 strategies that also improve the resiliency of communities to whatever nature throws at them,\u201d said Iain Murray, vice president for strategy at CEI. \n\nThe Five Goals for a Resilient Planet are: \n\nSecure Property Rights \n\nSecure the Rule of Law/Ending corruption \n\nEnsure Access to Affordable Energy \n\nEnsure Access to Capital and Credit \n\nAllow Markets in Education \n\n\u201cReal Goals to Improve the Developing World\u201d explains how Hong Kong and Singapore have already been successful in implementing these values to create strong communities. Small states such as Botswana, Honduras, and Ghana are examples of the next locations in the world where these five goals would be fertile ground for moving toward resiliency. \n\nMurray continued, \u201cTaken together, these coherent principles will allow for a much stronger, prosperous, more resilient planet than the bundle of often contradictory targets advanced by the UN and other sustainability advocates. An agenda that empowers people rather than bureaucrats, building a resilient and in that sense truly healthy society, is the best way to achieve human health and flourishing.\u201d \n\nTo read click here.
