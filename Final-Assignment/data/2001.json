He had said he initially expected to start with just individual drills. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s been no effects on the foot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels pretty good when I go out there and run routes.\u201d \n \nParker\u2019s hopeful that he\u2019ll be out there on Sept. 13 against Washington. But he won\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt like a veteran. It\u2019ll be a decision that coaches and trainers ultimately make. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s been a goal since I had (the surgery),\u201d he said of returning for the opener. \u201cWe just have to wait and see how it feels.\u201d \n \nDouglas at RG : While coach Joe Philbin won\u2019t publicly name a starter yet, rookie fourth-round pick Jamil Douglas has supplanted Billy Turner at right guard for now. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an honor,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cI know that I\u2019ve got to keep coming out every week and proving myself.\u201d \n \nDouglas played exclusively on the left side in college at Arizona State but said he\u2019s adjusting to right guard. \n \nDallas Thomas will start at left guard. \n \n\u201cThe first I did it, it was a little uncomfortable,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m able to go back and forth without any problems. I\u2019m glad they put me in that situation early.\u201d \n \nInjury updates : A day after all but one of Miami\u2019s active roster players participated in practice, several Dolphins players were out on Tuesday. \n \nCornerback Jamar Taylor, who has been out since injuring his quadriceps muscle in a preseason loss to Carolina, remains out. \n \nJason Fox, who missed last week\u2019s game with a concussion but returned to practice on Monday, did not participate on Tuesday. \n \nRunning back Mike Gillislee (quad), Don Jones (illness), Anthony Johnson (foot) were also out. \n  View Comments     Previous  Dolphins release Brandon Fields; Matt Darr is the new\u00a0punter", "source": "The Palm Beach Post"}
