PKL insists the product is ideal for exhibitions and conference centres, universities, hospitals, schools and offices. \n \nPKL claims the unit can be easily moved by just two people in a few seconds, while the facility\u2019s innovative clamshell construction means that it can be folded together to save on space when not in use. It is fully lockable so can be secured overnight. \n \nFeaturing a front and back counter, mounted on a rigid stainless steel frame set on castors, the Space Station unit can be bespoke fitted with equipment to suit a range of different food and beverage offers. \n \nIt offers a selection of hot, cold and ambient food display counters to choose from, along with under-counter refrigeration and freezer units. The back counter features a removable signage gantry for menus boards and branding, which easily slots onto the top of the unit. \n \nSpace Station requires one 63 amp electrical supply connected via a commando socket, with all ancillary equipment connected via 13 amp sockets which have been inbuilt into the unit. Ancillary equipment such as microwaves, soup kettles, pasta boilers, panini grills and specialist coffee machines can be specified according to the needs of each location.", "source": "Food Service Equipment Journal"}
