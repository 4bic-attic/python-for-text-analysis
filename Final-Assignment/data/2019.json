We are a team this season after many changes last season. We are a very good group together - that is important.\n\n\"Last season the first two or three months were difficult for me and for the other new players. This time I started the pre-season and that is very important. My body is better and I feel fitter.\n\n\"I have been playing right-back, which is my position. We are playing well with the full-backs in every game. I hope to stay in this position through hard work every day and hard work every match.\"\n\nBerardi featured 24 times for United in all competitions last season after securing a regular place in the team at the turn of the year.", "source": "Sports Mole"}
