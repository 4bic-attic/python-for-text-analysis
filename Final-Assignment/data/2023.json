Some of the\nproceeds would be used to repay loans, it added. \n \nIt gave no further details on acquisitions. \n \nSources told Reuters last week that Portugal's central bank\nwould turn to Fosun to negotiate the sale of Novo Banco after\ntalks with China's Anbang Insurance Group Co\nfailed. \n\nIn July, the Chinese conglomerate said it had purchased a\nlandmark building in the centre of Milan, as increasingly bold\nChinese firms flex their financial muscles overseas.\n \n($1 = 7.7499 Hong Kong dollars)\n\n (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Stephen Coates)", "source": "Reuters"}
