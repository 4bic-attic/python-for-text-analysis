Director Mark Rydell gives the $50 million picture a first-class polish, but fails to infuse the 2 plus hour project with any get-up-and-go Like a Porsche with a lawnmower engine, \u201cFor the Boys\u201d sputters across the screen, sometimes moving so slow that one almost expects to see the performers start to rust. Combining two feisty performers like Bette Midler and James Caan was inspired, but the broadbased script never fleshes out their characters Basically, \u201cFor the Boys\u201d is a relationship picture where a viewer cares little about the totally unfocused relationship. The story follows the long-time partnership between Dixie Leonard (Midler) and Bronx-born Eddie Sparks (Caan), entertainers who come across as Burns and Allen with an edge. As the story begins, Sparks is a star on the order of Bob Hope, a talented comic and soft shoe specialist who devotes every hour possible to entertaining World War II troops. When Sparks needs a replacement for his USO show, the comic\u2019s writer-friend, Art Silver (George Segal), suggests his talented niece Dixie, a woman with the bawdy humor of a burlesque comic and the sweet voice of an angel. Their initially uneasy relationship \u2014 need I tell you? \u2014 turns into a professional partnership, and \u201cFor the Boys,\u201d which sometimes raises an anti-war sentiment but never explores it, follows Dixie and Eddie as they entertain through the Korean War and then in Vietnam. To his credit, Rydell creates some stirring moments, such as Midler singing \u201cP.S. I Love You\u201d during a World War II blackout and in a later scene when performing for battle-weary Americans in Vietnam Whenever she sings, Midler stops the film, making one wish she had vocalized more often For some reason, Rydell, whose credits include \u201cThe Rose\u201d (also with Midler) and \u201cOn Golden Pond,\u201d felt obligated to turn what\u2019s basically a simple story into an epic motion picture. He throws in far too many elements, such as having Segal\u2019s left wing Jewish character fired \u2014 on Christmas day, no less \u2014 by Caari\u2019s Eddie during the \u201cred scare\u201d of the \u201950s The scene is forced, unnecessary and contrived. The Vietnam sequences have some genuine sting, since Eddie Sparks fails to comprehend the craziness of that paralyzing war and \u2014 as he did in World War II \u2014 says to the soldiers, \u201cI hear you\u2019re mixing it up pretty good!\u201d Their empty stares to his upbeat remark about killing an enemy they can\u2019t even locate make it clear that Eddie\u2019s time has come and gone.", "source": "BootLeg Betty"}
