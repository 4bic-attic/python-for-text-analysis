Among the reasons we chose September for our wedding, the biggest one for me is, it is my favorite time of year. The humid heat of summer is breaking, and the air is crisp, with cool nights and warm days. When the sky is clear, the blueness is exquisite and it\u2019s no longer so necessary to avoid the toasty sunshine. In fact, it practically begs a person to pause and soak it all in. The challenge is, there is barely a moment for pause. The daylight grows short and preparation for winter weather requires new projects be added to the list of others already underway or planned. This year, I am feeling as though the growing grass didn\u2019t get the memo about the arrival of September. It is hard to get ready for winter when summer won\u2019t back off and make room for fall. I spent most of the afternoon mowing lawn yesterday, after filling that dang right front tire on the tractor with a green slime leak sealant. Today I face the need to work the power trimmer to knock down the robust growth along edges and fence lines. It\u2019s a chore that resonates of mid-summer responsibilities, with one improvement: That crisp and gorgeous September air doesn\u2019t cause it to be such a sweaty, sticky job. . . . . . . . . . . .
