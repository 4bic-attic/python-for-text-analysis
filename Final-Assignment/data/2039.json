LaForge tweeted early on Tuesday, but university officials were not immediately available to clarify the comment. \n \nLamb was being sought for the early Monday killing of Ethan Schmidt, an assistant professor of American history at Delta State, as well as the earlier shooting of Amy Prentiss in Gautier, a town 300 miles (480 km) away, authorities have said. \n \nThe Cleveland, Mississippi shooting left students and staff at the school on edge for several hours as police locked down the campus and searched buildings following reports of active gunfire. Schmidt's colleagues said they could not speculate on the motive for his killing. \n \nDelta State officials said no students were injured in the shooting in Jobe Hall, home to the university's division of social sciences and history.
