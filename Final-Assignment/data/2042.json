Fentanyl addicts modify the patches so they can be chewed, smoked or made into an injectable solution. \n \nUneven distribution of the drug on a patch is factor in overdose deaths. When the patch is cut into strips to be burnt so the smoke can inhaled, there is the potential to get a lethal dose. \n \nPrior to Janson's 2013 arrest, Sarnia police had placed a tracking device on a vehicle in the belief a man was driving to London to get fentanyl. Janson was a passenger. \n \nThe vehicle was driven to Woodstock for a four-minute stop before heading back to Sarnia. \n \nPolice started surveillance as the vehicle neared Sarnia, but it is believed the officers were spotted. \n \nJanson threw a used tampon from the vehicle as she was moving about in the vehicle. \n \nAt a hospital she removed a bag with 34 patches. \n \nJanson also had $1,000 in her purse. \n \nThere was a joint sentencing submission by Crown and defence lawyers for a two-year sentence to be served in a penitentiary. \n \nThe nature of fentanyl \u201cups the ante\u201d regarding custody and if another drug had been involved penitentiary time would likely not have been considered, said defence lawyer Ken Marley. \n \nJanson had one prior conviction for drug possession and was not the main player in the July 2013 incident. Janson was under pressure by the driver to hide the fentanyl, the court was told. \n \nThe vehicle's driver was sentenced to 42 months. \n \nThe prison time is a opportunity for Janson to get serious about addiction treatment, said Robb. \n \nAddiction treatment is available in penitentiary. \n \n\u201cI am not a criminal. I am a drug addict who needs help,\u201d said Janson. \n \nAn addiction is an illness but Janson did something criminal, said Rogin who wished her luck with her treatment. \n \nA 10-year weapons ban was imposed and Janson must give police a DNA sample. \n \nneil.bowen@sunmedia.ca", "source": "Fort Erie Times"}
