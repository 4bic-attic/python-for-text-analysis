I have bought him for the next manager of Manchester United.\" \n \nSitting alongside Giggs, who made over 800 appearances for United during a 24-year career, Van Gaal added: \"And I feel I am introducing the next manager of Manchester United.\" \n \nHe also admitted he was happy to have the Welshman as his assistant after meeting him for 90 minutes in the Netherlands last year when the former winger gave his assessment of every player in the United squad. \n  \n \u00a9 2015 Sky News, all rights reserved", "source": "Metro Radio"}
