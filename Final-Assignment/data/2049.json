The level of management needed to stay competitive and above the high water line is, simply put, astounding. Consolidation in certain areas of agriculture has lead to factory farming, the widespread adoption of automation and genetically modified seeds that keep seed producers competitive. Private farmers are constantly at war with the market and their own budgets. \n \nThe agriculture industry has wholly transformed itself over the last 100 years. The automotive industry, which has only really existed for that same period of time, has seen similar levels of change.\u00a0We are now building more cars, trucks, SUVs, crossovers, trikes and quadracycles than ever before, just like we are growing more food than we\u2019ve ever seen in human\u00a0history. \n \nBut, there\u2019s one major stumbling block ahead\u00a0\u2014 and Sergio Marchionne sees it. \n \n\n \nMarchionne, at this point in his tenure as CEO of one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world, is a farmer with a cliff-side plot of land.\u00a0He\u2019s also the only farmer in his town with a massive debt bill to pay and no cash on hand to clear the ledger . \n \nThe reality of farming is, at the point of sale, the vast majority of consumers\u00a0couldn\u2019t care less where their produce is grown. On a macro level, produce buyers will purchase strawberries in the middle of winter, even if they are grown in Mexico. Locally, during in-season months, as long as those strawberries are juicy and ripe, produce buyers don\u2019t check the label to figure out where\u00a0they were grown. Sure, there are those who buy organic, gluten-free options at the grocery store \u2014 and they are a statistically significant in their numbers to deserve a whole aisle devoted to their tastes\u00a0\u2014 but the rest of us are completely apathetic. \n \nThe same goes for cars. \n \nCar enthusiasts \u2014 us folks who write, comment, drive, wrench on, wash and generally love our cars \u2014 are one percent of the overall consumer market. The other 99 percent of people are totally agnostic to the efforts\u00a0of automotive research, engineering, manufacturing and branding, with a few exceptions for those who want to \u201cBuy American!\u201d or some other loyalties of varying degrees. Enthusiasts do buy a very specific\u00a0type of product, and automakers are more than willing to provide those products to the degree they are demanded on the market, but we still only get a single aisle in a vast dealer lot. \n \nCorn enthusiasts, if there is\u00a0such a thing, might see the agriculture industry thusly: \n \n\u201cThe General Farms corn\u00a0stays fresh much, much longer than the new American-Italian corn from Marchionne Farms,\u201d a\u00a0connoisseur of corn\u00a0might say. \n \n\u201cBut, the Marchionne Farms\u2019 Hellcat Corn\u00a0 tastes better ,\u201d an equally loyal corn enthusiast might rebuff. \n \nThe other 99 percent of corn buyers are, well, not talking about corn. They don\u2019t care where it comes from. They don\u2019t care who made it. They look at the corn in the produce aisles, figure out the best deal for their needs, and buy the corn\u00a0that makes the most sense \u2014 a combination of number of ears of corn and how much it costs. All the while, corn enthusiasts are trying to push their corn consuming\u00a0friends one way or another. Sometimes they\u00a0succeed in their\u00a0suggestions, but not enough to make a real market impact. (See: SKYACTIV Corn.) \n \nStanding at the cliff\u2019s edge of his farm, Marchionne \u2014 with a hefty bank note on his mind \u2014 has an\u00a0epiphany: Why am I spending all this money growing\u00a0different corn than my neighbor? The components of corn \u2014 the cob, kernels and the way it\u2019s packaged \u2014 are essentially the same. How you dress it up and sell it, that\u2019s the only real difference! \n \nBut, it isn\u2019t the sameness of corn \u2014 or automobiles \u2014 that\u2019s the real issue here. \n \nIn probably a distant future, we aren\u2019t going to need corn. We will plug some instructions into a machine, a whirring sound will emanate, and a meal will be replicated\u00a0for consumption. You won\u2019t need to own the food replicator. Instead, you will pay a fee to use it that\u2019s magnitudes less than the current cost of food.\u00a0The farm as we know it will be a thing of the past. \n \nAutomakers are staring down the barrel of a similar fate. \n \nGoogle and automakers themselves are developing fully autonomous vehicles to be used by the masses. Their solutions are similar to the food replicator of the future: plug in a destination, a whirring sound will emanate and you\u2019ll arrive at your destination. You won\u2019t need to own the autonomous car of the future.\u00a0Instead, you will pay a fee to use it that\u2019s magnitudes less than the current cost of personal transportation.\u00a0The car\u00a0as we know it will be a thing of the past. \n \nThe autonomous car\u00a0is the ocean lapping against the cliff\u2019s edge, slowly \u2014 but with increased intensity \u2014 swallowing Marchionne\u2019s farm. \n \nNow, please, don\u2019t get me wrong. I am in no way saying that the things we love \u2014 cars as we know them today \u2014 will be gone next year or even in the next 20 years.\u00a0There might be a few companies still catering to the enthusiast,\u00a0offering\u00a0cars as artisanal luxury good for those of us who enjoy the speed and knowledge needed to pilot just such a machine. But the days of the automobile as a privately owned consumer necessity are numbered. Those who enjoy the act of driving will be the gasoline-fed hipsters of tom0rrow. \n \nMarchionne, I assume, knows this. The day his farm is\u00a0 needed is coming to an end. But not today. Today there\u2019s corn to grow and money to be made, and he\u2019s looking at his neighbor at General Farms that grows the same crop. \n \nFarmer Barra, let\u2019s grind some corn together, shall we? \n \nThe post Fields Are Fertile For Now, But Marchionne Has a Long View appeared first on The Truth About Cars .", "source": "The Truth About Cars"}
