Clashes broke out between protestors and security forces in Sopore and Baramulla with the former blocking the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway at Pattan and Kreeri. The bodies of the deceased, believed to be aged between 17 and 21, were found in Shuru (Dangerpora) village of Pattan tehsil. One of the deceased has been identified as Sopore resident Amir, who was missing since July 15. \nHis uncle Abdur Rashid Rishi said, \"We had filed a police complaint, but nothing was done to trace him.\" He said Amir was studying in Class IX. Another body is said to be of Ashiq Hussain Wani, who had gone missing last June from his hometown in Pattan. But police sources said Amir belonged to Lashkar-e-Islam, a splinter faction of Hizbul Mujahideen, while Wani worked for Hizbul. Fearing violence, the police took the bodies to a hospital for autopsy. Sources told Mirror that the bodies bore torture marks. One of the bodies had nails pulled out. While former CM Omar Abdullah called for a credible, transparent postmortem, PDP general secretary Rafi Ahmad Mir condemned the murders.", "source": "AhmedabadMirror.com"}
