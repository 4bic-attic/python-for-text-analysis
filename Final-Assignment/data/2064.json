So it sat from about \u201807 with a little bit of activity in \u201808. But from then until just this spring it had been dormant,\u201d said owner of Safe Harbour (a construction company) Jeff Irvine. \n \nIrvine was recently approached by Greeneville Mayor and fellow real estate businessman W.T. Daniels to discuss completing the project. \n \nSo far, Safe Harbour has completed 1 more homes with plans to build a total of 27 houses. \n \nDaniels\u00a0said he\u2019s excited to add housing options in Greeneville because housing availability and a\u00a0healthy economy go hand in hand. \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to recruit industry recruit jobs and that kind of thing you have to have housing to provide it\u2019s like anything it\u2019s like your school system,\u201d said Daniels. \n \nIrvine said his company will break ground on the second home this week. Irvine said he hopes to finish the subdivision within the next two years. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nCopyright 2015 WJHL.
