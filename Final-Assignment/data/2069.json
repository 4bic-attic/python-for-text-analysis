Mackenzie truly stepped up her game to help our team to victory,\u201d Voyager coach Mariah Jackson said. \n \nOn Saturday, Voyager beat N.C. School of Science and Mathematics and Wendell\u2019s Corinth Holders. \n\nPanthers cut WR Boykin, CB White to trim roster to 75 \n\nCHARLOTTE \u2014 The Carolina Panthers waived wide receiver Jarrett Boykin and waived-injured former starting cornerback Melvin White on Tuesday. \n\nThe team also waived safety Robert Lester, defensive tackle Kenny Horsley and wide receiver De'Andre Presley, and waived-injured defensive tackle Micanor Regis. Also, wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin was placed on injured reserve as the team reached the 75-player roster limit. \n\nThe Panthers boasted about their depth at wide receiver throughout the offseason, but that core has dwindled. Benjamin and Stephen Hill both tore ACLs during training camp and Boykin, despite leading all wide receivers with 91 yards on nine receptions in the preseason, didn't show the consistency. \n\nThe Panthers traded on Monday with Seattle to acquire for Kevin Norwood, a fourth-round pick in 2014 who caught nine passes last season. \n\n\"He's a guy who is used to winning,\" quarterback Cam Newton said. \n\nCarolina's receivers have been plagued by several drops the last two preseason games, but Newton said he isn't allowing it to affect his approach to the game. \n\n\"Those are things I can't worry about,\" Newton said. \"It doesn't affect me one bit. I want guys who are ready to come in and play and I think (Norwood) is ready to come in and do that. This is a production league.

The Hurricanes will pay Ward $6.8 million in 2015-16 in the final year of the six-year contract he signed a year later. \n\nStaal, 30, took over as team captain in 2010, has led the team in scoring in seven of his 10 seasons and is the only player in club history with four straight All-Star game appearances. Ward, 31, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs as a rookie in 2006. \n\nNice week in net for Duke\u2019s Proctor \n\nDURHAM \u2014 Duke women\u2019s soccer goalkeeper E.J. Proctor is the defensive player of the week in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the sophomore also earned a spot on TopDrawerSoccer.com National Team of the Week. \n\nProctor collected her first two career shutouts this past week against Penn State and William & Mary, both nationally ranked teams. \n \nDuke\u2019s cross-country team off and running \n\nDURHAM \u2014 The Duke women\u2019s cross-country both hosted and won the inaugural Duke Alumni Meet here Tuesday. \n\nThe Blue Devils beat an alumni team comprised of six former Duke student-athletes by placing all eight of their competitors in front of the first alumni finisher.
