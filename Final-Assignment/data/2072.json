HP had more than 300,000 employees as of Oct. 31, 2014.\n\nIn the latest third quarter HP's revenue from personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent. Enterprise services division sales dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is expected to have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and report adjusted profit of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2016, HP said on Tuesday.\n\nThe business is expected to report free cash flow of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.", "source": "Melbourne Age"}
