The MD&M Philadelphia Conference takes \n      place October 7-8 in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. \n \n Key Information \nPresentation : \n      Medical Materials to the Rescue: Leveraging Polymer Innovation to \n      Prevent Device Implant Infections \nWhen : Thursday, October 8, \n      2015 11:15 am \u2013 11:45 a.m. \nWhere : Pennsylvania Convention \n      Center, Philadelphia, PA \n \n About MD&M Philadelphia: MD&M Philadelphia brings together \n      the regions Medtech Community to delve into the latest challenges and \n      opportunities that are impacting the industry.
