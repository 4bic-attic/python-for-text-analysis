Bloomberg   by Marianna Papadakis  \nLawyers say the shifting of competition law policy to the Treasury portfolio could progress much-needed reforms, leaving behind ongoing controversy over proposed changes to misuse of market power provisions. \n\nNew Treasurer Scott Morrison confirmed he was taking over responsibility for competition\u00a0policy,\u00a0along with the\u00a0response\u00a0to David Murray's Financial System\u00a0Inquiry, given their importance to the\u00a0economy.\u00a0 \n\n\"I expect there will be a temptation to be pragmatic \u2013 pick up the political and economic winners and leave controversy well enough alone,\"\u00a0said Allen &\u00a0Overy\u00a0partner Peter McDonald. \n\nMr McDonald said the path for reform was always going to be treacherous, but a change of minister added extra spice. \n \nLawyers\u00a0predict that it could lead to more objective and less\u00a0polarising\u00a0progress, given the clear conflict of interest of having competition\u00a0policy fall under the small business portfolio.\u00a0But\u00a0small\u00a0business fears that removing competition law to the ambit of the new Treasurer could\u00a0signal\u00a0the government is leaning more towards the interests\u00a0of big business. \n\nDespite hopes for progress, many corporate lawyers would rather one element be left behind: the so-called \"effects test\", one of 56 recommendations\u00a0proposed by the Harper review, which would amend the current long-standing misuse of market power rules. \n\nPrime Minister Turnbull has assured that the effects test\u00a0will be dealt with by cabinet after it was pushed as part of the new Nationals' coalition agreement.\u00a0Before\u00a0Mr Turnbull's successful leadership challenge, the issue had been dumped despite the protestations of former small business minister Bruce\u00a0Billson\u00a0who had pushed for the reform. \nBusiness community on edge  \nWith Mr Morrison indicating he was \"going to take my time on it\" the timeframe remains unclear leaving the\u00a0business community on edge. \n\nThe Productivity Commission supports the\u00a0reform.\u00a0If introduced, a company would need to have\u00a0the \"purpose, effect or likely effect\" of substantially lessening competition to breach misuse of market power restrictions.\u00a0The current provision requires proof that a company \"took advantage\" of its market power and its purpose was to damage a competitor. \n\nProductivity Commission chairman Peter Harris lamented this week that controversy over the reform was derailing progress on other Harper-supported recommendations that could boost the nation's productivity, income and employment. \n\nThose who oppose the changes include\u00a0Professor Bob Baxt, an emeritus partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, who said it would not help to protect small business against bigger, more efficient competitors. \n \n\"It's an absolute fallacy to think it will change the way the courts deal with their concerns,\" he said. \n\n\"Competition law was never intended to protect small business from more efficient competitors.\" \n\nHe said misuse of market power laws should be left alone until the right case came to the High Court for determination.\u00a0This could occur if the ACCC wins a bid for special leave to appeal to the High Court over its loss against Flight Centre in a price fixing case .\u00a0It will also be a matter for determination by the full bench of the Federal Court in November when it will hear the\u00a0 ACCC's appeal against\u00a0Pfizer \u00a0for misusing its market power. \n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers partner Murray Deakin said the new cabinet should be very wary about introducing an effects test, which would place Australia at odds with the rest of the world. \n \n\"The introduction of an effects test with such a low market power threshold is likely to constrict, not expand economic activity, which is not what this country needs,\" he said. \n\nClifford Chance partner Dave\u00a0Poddar\u00a0said it was Australia's competition law equivalent of a \"zombie section\" that kept coming back from the dead. \n\n\"Competition policy is a whole of economy issue and it's important that the pro-competitive reforms in the Harper Report are taken forward to unlock productivity benefits to the economy as a whole,\" Mr\u00a0Poddar\u00a0said.", "source": "Australian Financial Review"}
