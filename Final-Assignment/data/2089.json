It\u2019s part of a brand new poster by artist JC Richard that takes one of the most iconic scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and turns it into a painfully beautiful limited edition poster. That poster, called Well of Souls, will be released by the Bottleneck Gallery and Acme Archives on Wednesday September 9 at noon EST at www.bottleneckgallery.com. Officially licensed by Lucasfilm, here it is in all its beauty\u2014exclusively here on io9. Advertisement It\u2019s a 12 x 36 inch screenprint in a signed and numbered edition of 225, and it\u2019ll cost $50. Richard made a previous Raiders of the Lost Ark print last year called The Map Room (check it out) to sell at MondoCon, a poster convention in Austin, Texas. There, I spoke to him and he said his idea was to do a nine Indiana Jones posters, three for each movie. It remains to be seen if he\u2019ll hit that lofty goal, but this is the second one. And it\u2019s even more beautiful than the last. Here are a few more detailed shots of the poster. Contact the author at germain@io9.com.", "source": "io9"}
