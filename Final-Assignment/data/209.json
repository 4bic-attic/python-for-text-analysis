Previously, only local retail investors could buy the stock. Etisalat has soared 22 percent since it announced the decision to open up to foreign investors three months ago. \n\nDubai's benchmark stock index rose 0.7 percent, supported by a rebound in a number of stocks after several days of declines.\n\nProperty developer DAMAC jumped 3.5 percent ahead of a shareholder meeting later in the day which will vote on the firm's first cash dividend since it listed in Dubai in January.\n\nSaudi Arabia's main index was nearly flat as banks offset losses in other sectors. National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi climbed 1.4 percent each and were the main support for the market ahead of this week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could result in a rise in interest rates.\n\nThe Saudi riyal is pegged to the dollar, so Riyadh is very likely to adjust interest rates as well, boosting banks' margins.\n\nOther Gulf markets were soft. Qatar edged down 0.3 percent, Kuwait fell 0.6 percent and Oman was down 0.4 percent.", "source": "Arabian Business"}
