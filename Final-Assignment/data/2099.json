In a joint memo ( http://polling.clearpath.org/docs/clearpath_pollster_memo.pdf ) released today, the pollsters write, \"\u2026support for clean energy is strong both with the overall electorate and with the conservative Republicans that form a core constituency for many Republican elected officials.\" \n\nKey findings include: \n84% of registered voters, including almost three-quarters of Republicans, favor taking action to accelerate the development and use of clean energy in the United States .  Energy independence, less pollution, and job growth are viewed by GOP voters as the \"big 3\" of clean energy benefits.  Solar policy enjoys enormous support among Republicans, with rooftop solar (82%) and net metering (86%) scoring highest among seven clean energy policy ideas tested.  Most voters \u2013 including a majority of Republicans (56%) \u2013 think the climate is changing and human activity is playing a role.  Among different approaches that win over voters on the issue of climate and clean energy, positive messages that emphasize what America can achieve are the most effective.  In particular, Republican and independent voters favor a candidate who says regardless of the debate over climate we should expand the use of clean energy because of its benefits and to mitigate risk. \n\"Voters are looking for leaders who want to solve problems and go beyond party politics. Voters, including Republicans, want to take a step back from the politicization of energy and climate issues and pursue clean energy on its own merits,\" said Kristen Soltis Anderson , co-founder of Echelon Insights. \n\n\"This research shows that conservative Republicans overwhelmingly support clean energy policy and respond favorably to positive solution-based messages,\" said Whit Ayres , founder and president of North Star Opinion Research. \n  \n\"These results underscore that clean energy has support not just with voters overall, but also with conservative Republicans. The innovation and independence that clean energy offers strikes a chord with voters across party lines,\" added Glen Bolger , partner at Public Opinion Strategies. \n\nSurvey Background \nTo test the generally accepted belief that conservatives do not support clean energy solutions, ClearPath engaged three prominent GOP polling firms to test voters' responses to clean energy messages.\u00a0 From August 24-27, 2015 , Echelon Insights completed 1200 live telephone interviews with registered voters nationwide, including an oversample of 500 Republicans. Approximately 60% of the interviews were conducted on landlines and 40% were completed on cell phones. The margin of sampling error for the full national sample is +/- 2.83%. \n\nClearPath polling center:\u00a0 www.polling.clearpath.org  \n\nMemo on national poll findings: http://polling.clearpath.org/docs/clearpath_pollster_memo.pdf \n\nCharts and analysis of poll results: http://polling.clearpath.org/docs/clearpath_survey_report.pdf \n\nAbout ClearPath \nClearPath is a private foundation dedicated to accelerating America's clean energy future through conservative solutions.
