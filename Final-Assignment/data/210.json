The unusual site and large trees forced Olsen out of his normal \u201cbox\u201d and the result is two distinct pavilions linked by a glazed entrance gallery. The public spaces occupy one side and the private spaces are on the other making for an unusually natural and effective separation. The home is still owned by the family for which it was built which explains its amazing state of preservation. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to become only the second owner of a home of this quality.", "source": "edificionado"}
