And she laments the way it is disappearing. \n\n\u201cMachines are taking over. Even just going down to the camps, I see a lot of machinery. That\u2019s pretty sad,\u201d said Marshall, who harvested berries 40 years ago. \u201cOur people could really pick that.\u201d \n\nA steady push toward mechanization in Maine\u2019s blueberry industry is reducing the number of migrant farmers who travel to the state to rake the crop, which is vitally important to the state\u2019s economy, state officials and industry leaders said. Maine\u2019s blueberry harvest attracted more than 5,000 migrant farmers 10 years ago and it\u2019s down to about 1,500 today, said David Yarborough, a University of Maine professor of horticulture. \n\nWorkers have come to Maine to rake blueberries for years, and many of today\u2019s rakers are of Latin American or Caribbean origin. Others are Native American or aboriginal people of Canada, like Marshall, who hails from Nova Scotia, and some are Mainers. Reliance on migrant farming grew with the growth on the crop, which exploded from 20 million pounds per year in the 1970s to 50 or 60 million pounds per year 10 years ago and 90 million pounds per year now, said Yarborough. \n\nThis year, migrant farmers will pick some 90 million pounds of the wild blueberries \u2013 praised for their benefits as an anti-oxidant rich food \u2013 that are indigenous in Maine and parts of Canada. They will form communities of their own that revolve around hubs like the Blueberry Harvest School and ethnic restaurants such as the migrant-founded Vazquez Mexican Takeout. There\u2019s even an end-of-harvest Wyman\u2019s Cup soccer competition for pickers at Jasper Wyman and Son. \n\nThe increasing harvests came alongside the development of mechanized harvesters \u2013 heavy pieces of machinery operated by a driver \u2013 which started to play more of a role in the 1990s, workers in the industry said. Some blueberry operations have gone almost completely mechanized, and more are headed in that direction, Yarborough said. \n\nThe trend means less work for migrant farmers who have long relied on blueberry season as a chance to earn several hundred dollars per week in the summer. The season typically begins in late July and ends around Labor Day. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really gone down considerably,\u201d Yarborough said. \u201cIt\u2019s subject to drop as we produce more and better machines.\u201d \n\nGrowing mechanization is also making the nature of the remaining work more difficult. Rakers are left to work in parts of the fields that the mechanical harvesters can\u2019t reach, like ditches and uneven land. \n\nThat makes a form of labor that already includes repetitive lifting and bending in the hot sun even more difficult. \n\n\u201cOur people are sent out to the gullies,\u201d said Marshall, who now travels to Maine every summer to work at Blueberry Harvest School. \n\nThe state has some 44,000 acres of wild blueberries, based mostly in the rural Downeast area, and the state relies on the berries for about $250 million per year in economic value, official said. Blueberries are also one of the state\u2019s key cultural identifiers, along with lighthouses and lobsters. \n\nEd Flanagan, chief executive officer of blueberry producer Jasper Wyman and Son, said his business has gone from about 20 percent mechanized ten years ago to 70 percent mechanized today. A spokesman for Passamaquoddy Wild Blueberry Company said the business has gone from 100 percent rakers just six or seven years ago to 40 percent mechanized today. \n\n\u201cThings are changing as more machines take to the fields in place of hand crews,\u201d Flanagan said. \n\nIt remains to be seen if the trend will eventually jeopardize the existence of the community that has grown around migrant blueberry farming every year. But Briana Mejia, a raker who has been coming to work the fields for seven years, said the trend toward machines and away from workers is clear. \n\n\u201cWhen someone builds a bigger, better machine that can do the gullies, what\u2019s going to happen then?\u201d Mejia said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making money.\u201d", "source": "Charlotte Observer"}
