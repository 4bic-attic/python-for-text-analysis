The latest product in Vycom\u2019s Flametec family, Thermax helps fabricators like Plastic Design meet the strict requirements of Factory Mutual (FM) 4910, which are designed to reduce fire and smoke threats to worker safety and damage to delicate semiconductor wafers used in electronics manufacturing. \n \n\u201cWe always strive to provide value to our customers,\u201d said co-owner/co-president Daryl Flynn, whose family business began in 1976.  \u201cThermax is a PVC that has great workability and performance, while meeting 4910 standards very economically.\u201d  Flynn is proud of his fabrication company\u2019s ISO 9000 registration and says quality has to be number one. \n \nFor a current job with Draper Laboratory, a not-for-profit research and development laboratory, Plastic Design is using Thermax to create cabinetry, bottle holders and large fume hoods with protective covers for a clean room lab environment. \nFlynn says semiconductors and chip manufacturing clean rooms are tough environments and the materials his company fabricates have to withstand harsh chemicals.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want staining or corrosion on the chemical side,\u201d he said.  \u201cThermax has never given us any issues with corrosion or workability.\u201d \n \nIn fact, Plastic Design uses such high volumes of Flametec products, the company is listed as a distributor.  \u201cThe new Thermax seems to be a good fit and a way to add value to our projects,\u201d said Flynn.  The material is also lighter weight, which is a plus for handling during manufacturing phase and results in reduced shipping costs. \n \nIn addition to FM4910, Flametec Thermax PVC also meets UL-94 V-0, ASTM E-84 and is RoHS and REACH compliant.
