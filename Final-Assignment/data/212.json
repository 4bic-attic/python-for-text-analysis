According to new data, Milwaukee's seemingly sudden increase in violence is part of a larger national trend represented in statistics compiled by the New York Times:\rLaw enforcement experts are unsure what exactly is causing the dramatic spike in homicides across many major U.S. cities, though they do believe \"disparate factors are at play in different cities.\" Maddeningly, the New York Times\u00a0reveals that \"some officials\" are claiming that the renewed scrutiny facing the increasingly detrimental problem of\u00a0police brutality has \"made officers less aggressive and emboldened criminals.\" Thankfully, most experts vehemently disagree with this theory.\rThough murder rates in New York and Chicago hit record lows in 2014, both rates have shown a notable increase in the first eight months of 2015. New York is currently experiencing an estimated increase of nine percent, with Chicago doubling that rapidity with a 20 percent increase. Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent in Chicago, believes that the widespread prevalence of guns is largely to blame. \"Across the country, we\u2019ve all found it\u2019s not the individual who never committed a crime before suddenly killing somebody,\u201d says McCarthy.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the repeat offenders. It\u2019s the same people over and over again.\u201d\rYxc2s3cjqfuKECan08hQUpV19NJzHcH3\r\u00a0", "source": "all"}
