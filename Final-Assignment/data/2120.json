My daughter was an amazing young mom, she worship her son, she would have changed places with him in a heart beat. I am so happy there is also another song out there called precious child who have given me permission to play my grandson's video on utube, I just wished westlife would let us all use their song for our little ones memorial, like I am not selling it or making money on their song, I just loved the song and wanted to add it to joshua's memorial. Joshua came into my daughter's life at the right time, he changed her and she went on to the right side of life, he saved her,. So joshua arrived on angel's wings, and saved her for awhile.
