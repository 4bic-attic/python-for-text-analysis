Perhaps it\u2019s the extremely unique handmade approach to each individual letter. Or maybe it\u2019s the price, which makes collecting a set of letters a little difficult. These letters have so much personality that they\u2019re more like a piece of art to add to your favorite wall. You can even request your own custom version of your initial. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do for my initial, do you? \n \n   \n \nThe post monster alphabet appeared first on Small for Big .", "source": "Small for Big"}
