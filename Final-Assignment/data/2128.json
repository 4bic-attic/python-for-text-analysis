The letters promise huge payouts to the recipient if the recipient first pays a \u2018processing fee,\u2019 usually between  $10 and $20,\u201d said Prosecuting Attorney Justin F. Kollar. \u201cThese letters often have official-looking seals and signatures and may appear to be very serious, usually urging immediate action and warning recipients not to share the letter or its contents with anyone else.\u201d \n \nThese scams often target seniors and retired persons as they tend to be more trusting of unknown individuals. Responsible family members should help to protect them from falling victim. \n \n\u201cThe basic rule is that if it looks too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Kollar said. \u201cPlease be very careful anytime you are asked to send money or personal information to somebody you don\u2019t know personally. Once that money is gone, in all likelihood, it is not coming back.\u201d \n \nResidents who have questions or concerns can contact the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney at 241-1888, the Kauai Police Department at 241-1711, or the County of Kauai Agency on Elderly Affairs, 241-4470. \n  \nAdvertisement", "source": "KHON 2"}
