This is because we approach the two concepts differently. For dedicated yogis, they approach the activity as a lifelong journey to self improvement. They form a spiritual connection to the practice. When it comes to working out, many people approach it more clinically. They get hung up on seeing instant results and feel like hitting the gym or going for a run is a chore and not a part of maintaining a balanced lifestyle.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having external or aesthetic goals, but in my experience, most clients who find true, long-term success also tend to fall in love with the process itself.\u201d says Jessi Kneeland, personal trainer and fitness writer. Yoga teaches students to know their strengths and limitations. It is about doing only what your body is capable of, and not straining yourself to do a downward dog. Whereas, working out is only considered productive if you feel like a nauseous, sweaty mess afterwards. \u201cThe future of the fitness industry should be anti \u2013 fast results and anti \u2013 instant gratification.\u201d explains Jessi. Changing your workout mentality is the simple, easy way to change your results. Look at the weight room as a place of learning and improvement. Going for a run isn\u2019t something we have to fight through until we\u2019re \u2018bikini body ready\u2019, it is a part of our lifelong dedication to fitness. Look at fitness the way you look at yoga, and see how things change! What are your thoughts? How do you stay motivated?
