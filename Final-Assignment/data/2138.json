David Cameron  [embedded content] \nSusanna got the giggles when she sat down with the Prime Minister for an interview at his home in March. While asking questions about parents\u2019 evenings and family life in Number 10, she nibbled the end of her pen and laughed, while displaying her legs in a short blue dress. \n 2. Luke Evans  [embedded content] \nSusanna\u2019s flirty encounter with Dracula Untold star Luke Evans in October last year ended with the actor nibbling her neck. \n \nShe asked the actor: \u201cWhat is it like when you go in for the big bite?\u201d and suggested: \u201cShall we do it?\u201d \n \nLuckily Luke was game and flashed: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show me your neck first, though,\u201d before jokingly nuzzling in. \u201cThat was quite nice, actually,\u201d Susanna finished. \n 3. Jeremy Renner  [embedded content] \nSusanna left Avengers star Jeremy Renner looking embarrassed when she praised his physique on the GMB sofa. \n \nWhen asked about whether he\u2019d be taking part in charity football match Soccer Aid earlier this year, Jeremy replied: \u201cI\u2019d always be honoured to go do that but I\u2019d have to get in better shape.\u201d \n   Promoted stories   \nSusanna quickly replied: \u201cYou look in pretty good shape by the way. You look in great shape.\u201d \n \nThey were left in stitches as she quipped of her reputation: \u201cNow you\u2019ve landed me in it. I always get into trouble for these things.\u201d \n 4. Alex Turner  [embedded content] \n\u201cI bet you look good on the dance floor,\u201d ended Susanna\u2019s teasing interview with Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner in 2013 while she was still working for BBC Breakfast. \n \nThe presenter, who is 15 years Alex\u2019s senior, asked him if he\u2019d ever take a twirl on Strictly Come Dancing as she flicked her hair and giggled. Alex replied back: \u201cI should have been the one that said you look good on the dance floor.\u201d \n 5. David Beckham (again)  [embedded content] \nSusanna struck again when she interviewed Becks for GMB in February this year. She hung onto the footballer\u2019s every word as he discussed his new fund to mark 10 years as a Unicef ambassador and flapped her hands to her face as he spoke lovingly of being an embarrassing dad to his four children. \n 6. Angel Delight  [embedded content] \nTwitter went into meltdown in July when Susanna turned her attention to a bowl of Angel Delight dessert. Realising she had no spoon in a retro-food cooking segment, she suggestively licked the butterscotch-flavour pudding off her little finger. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\u201cYou know what, I wasn\u2019t given a spoon, but I find with Angel Delight you can just use your finger,\u201d she said. \u201cMmmm that\u2019s good. That\u2019s sweet. That\u2019s really sweet,\u201d she added.", "source": "Yeovil Express"}
