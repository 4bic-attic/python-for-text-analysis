Dr. Otis Moss, III, Senior Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, spoke during this year\u2019s\u00a0Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference prayer breakfast, and NewsOne Now was there to capture his inspirational message. \n \nMoss connected the plight of the Black Lives Matter movement with the mission of a monumental Biblical figure.\u00a0Rev. Moss expounded upon his point, saying John the Baptist was put in place to \u201cdesign and create a ministry that will help the next generation.\u201d \n \n\u201cJohn comes in a period of history when the synagogue had been captured by Roman rule. Because previous to the period there was something known as the Maccabean Revolt. The Maccabean Revolt was the revolt that pushed back those Persians that sought to destroy the Hebrew community,\u201d said Moss. \n  \nLater during his remarks, Moss explained that High Priests at the time were in place to \u201cpreach about the personal, but not preach about the public,\u201d which Rev. Moss considered to be \u201cprophetic.\u201d \n \n\u201cAs long as you are talking about how I\u2019m doing personally, you can say whatever you want. But if you start talking about poverty, if you start talking about mass incarceration, if you start talking about food deserts, the powers that be will attempt to \u2018take you out.\u2019\u201d \n  \nAccording to Moss, John the Baptist\u00a0connected with\u00a0\u201ca decentralized movement\u201d because he recognized that \u201cHebrew lives matter.\u201d Moss continued to explain that John\u00a0moved out into the desert to \u201cunderstand and communicate to people of this decentralized movement\u201d because it was\u00a0about \u201cthe next generation.\u201d \n \nMoss considered this to be John\u2019s \u201cdesert assignment.\u201d He continued, saying John\u2019s assignment was\u00a0in a \u201cplace of little resources, a place that will never grow and develop\u201d and implored those in attendance to \u201caccept\u201d their own desert assignments. \n \nRev. Moss further explained his point: \u201cMany of those who are collectively here (attending the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference), your constituency is not on the fruited plain, but in the desert. Your constituency is a constituency that has low resources, deals with mass incarceration, is dealing with a food desert, and if we are to be who God calls us to be, we must be willing to accept our desert assignment.\u201d \n \n\u00a0\u201cThere is a desert inside our communities from food, education to mass incarceration and miseducation, and let us be clear here \u2013 this is the new Jim Crow,\u201d said Moss. \n  \nMoss then quoted Michelle Alexander, acclaimed civil rights lawyer and author of\u00a0 The New Jim Crow, \u00a0saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not because people have some type of cultural or moral or ethical deficit.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe must understand that because of their proximity to poverty, there is limited access to and availability and because of their racial identity, they end up being incarcerated because of their proximity to opportunity and limited opportunity, and so we must accept our desert assignments,\u201d said Moss. \n  \nRev. Moss added that things will not\u00a0grow at the same rate they would if you were not in a desert, but \u201d\u00a0you have to be comfortable where God calls you.\u201d \n \nWatch excerpts of Rev.
