This video deals with playing video games with the new interactive doll My Friend Cayla. Basically you download an app on to the mobile device of your choice and connect to My Friend Cayla via Bluetooth. As of this video's release, there are two games that are on the app. One is Tic-Tac-Toe. The other is the classic Memory Match card game where you use your memory to match two cards. The doll has the same emotionless reaction regardless of whether she wins, loses, or the game comes to a draw.\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Szv9iuLhmC0]\n\nI've also set up a playlist of all of the videos in this series so you can watch the ones you've missed or even watch your favorites all over again.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRA0k5P3NBE?list=PLOJBJFwYpqDs9VZzmyfxFz8eSGncnTU5L]", "source": "Sagittarius Dolly"}
