We don\u2019t have details but we are hearing that Al-Shebab militants attacked the base,\u201d said Mohamed Shire, a Somali military commander based in the region. \n \nA local eyewitness said Shebab fighters stormed into the base. \n \n\u201cHeavy fighting broke out after a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into the camp,\u201d said local resident Ali Moalim Yusuf. \u201cI saw heavily armed fighters chanting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 (\u2018God is greatest\u2019) pouring into the base.\u201d \n \nThe militants, who are fighting to overthrow Somalia\u2019s internationally-backed and AU-protected government, confirmed they were behind the attack. \n \n\u201cMujaheddin fighters captured the base after a suicide bomber struck it, the enemy fled,\u201d the Islamists said in a brief statement. \n \nIn June, Shebab fighters killed dozens of Burundian soldiers when they overran an AMISOM outpost northwest of the capital. The militants also stage frequent suicide attacks inside the capital. \n \nBut AMISOM, the 22,000-strong AU force in Somalia, has also made key gains against the Shebab in recent months, pushing them out of several strongholds in the southwest of the country. \n \n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "Rising Sun Chatsworth"}
