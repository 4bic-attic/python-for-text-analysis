Australian-born Konta downed Petkovic 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 to book a last-16 matchup with Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova, who routed Slovakia's Anna Karolina Schmiedlova 6-2, 6-1. After almost two hours, 97th-ranked Konta reached the fourth round for the first time at any Grand Slam event.  It was her 16th win in a row, although many of those were in sub-WTA level events and three came in Open qualifying. Not since Jo Durie in 1991 had a British woman reached the US Open's last 16. \n\n\nAFP", "source": "Yahoo! Finance"}
