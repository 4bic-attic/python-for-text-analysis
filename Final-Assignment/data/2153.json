Besides revenue predictions, our new analysis shows recent results, growth rates and market shares. \n\nThe new survey gives you 63 tables, 40 charts and three interviews with companies. So help your research, analyses and decisions now, also benefiting your authority and reputation for technological and commercial insight. \n\nAnd the following sections explain how that investigation helps your work. \n\nPredictions for the cellular assays market and its segments \u2013 assess sales prospects \nWhat potential does that biomedical industry hold? And what secrets underpin its progress? Discover in our report overall world revenue to 2025 for cell assays, with discussions. \n\nAlso find individual revenue predictions from 2015 for submarkets there, at world level: \n\n- Products \n\n- Services. \n\nAnd get further revenue breakdown, from 2015, by application: \n\n- Drug discovery \n\n- ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) \n\n- Basic research. \n\nThere assess revenue expansion, hearing where you could gain. Those uses include toxicity testing. See what's possible and investigate competition among developers and producers of cellular tests. You explore products, services, emerging technologies and rising sales. \n\nThat work also divides its overall world market into geographical revenue predictions. \n\nSales in leading national markets \u2013 what demand for medical cell assaying? \nOur analyses also show you individual revenue forecasts to 2025 for 11 leading countries: \n\n- United States (US) \n\n- Japan \n\n- Germany , France , United Kingdom (UK), Italy and Spain (EU5 countries), also with an overall European Union prediction \n\n- Brazil , Russia , India and China (BRIC nations). \n\nThere you find countries with highest revenues, demand and potential increases in cell assay use and sales. And you understand competitors, needs and opportunities. That way you explore trends, progress and potentials, discovering what gains the future holds. \n\nAlso how do events, challenges and advances in technology affect that bioassays sector? Our study explains. It discusses progress, policies and trends influencing cellular assaying, helping you stay ahead in knowledge. \n\nForces affecting developers and producers of those drug discovery and development tools \nThe report explains issues, operations and events affecting that market from 2015. Those forces influencing companies developing, making and selling those systems include these: \n\n- Uses in drug discovery, validating targets and lead profiling \u2013 including 2D and 3D bioassaying systems \n\n- Platforms using high throughput screening (HTS) for improved testing efficiency \n\n- Stem cells (inc. IPSCs) to extend molecular screening, esp. in toxicology studies, and other cell lines for pharma in vitro assays \n\n- Systems using biochemical assays, GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) and label-free methods \n\n- Applications in developing biological drugs \n\n- Contract and clinical research organisations (CROs) in that early-stage drug development. \n\nAnd you explore these trends and influences, among others: \n\n- Lead identification, target validation, primary, secondary and ADME screening \n\n- Cell assaying equipment, kits, consumables and disposables \n\n- Detection technology, microplate readers, microfluidics and flow cytometry, inc. assay miniaturisation and automation \n\n- Multiplexing to improve efficiency in studying biological materials \n\n- Cell viability and mitochondrial function assays in biomedical research \n\n- High content screening (HCS) \u2013 optimising processes, increasing R&D pipeline efficiencies. \n\nThere you explore what progress, trends and prospects in those bioassays mean. And discover what benefits and what restricts participants in that industry, affecting its results. \n\nCell technologies for medical product development \u2013 top companies and 2018 market value \nWhat does the future hold? Our study predicts that world market will reach $5.5bn in 2018. \n\nAlso, from 2015, outsourcing of cell-based assay processes will increase. There pharmaceutical clients and CROs will benefit. See how, discovering potentials. \n\nAnd our new report examines activities of many companies, including these: \n\n- Thermo Fisher Scientific \n\n- PerkinElmer \n\n- DiscoveRx \n\n- GE Healthcare \n\n- ProQinase \n\n- Charles River Laboratories \n\n- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company). \n\nThere you find profiles of 18 prominent, rising and emerging companies.
