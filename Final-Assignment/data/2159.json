Naturally the conversation turned to her relationship with Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson. \n \n\n \nCiara has been catching heat from her ex-fiance, rapper Future, and fans because of her decision to allow Wilson around she and Future\u2019s one-year old son. \n \n\n \nMany felt it was too early in her relationship to have Baby Future around Russell. Ciara says that this is a double standard. She pointed out that Future has four children and she was around them early into their relationship. She also says she attempted to set up a meeting between Future and Russell but Future declined. \n \nCiara also goes on to discuss she and Russell\u2019s decision to practice celibacy. Cici says it\u2019s difficult, but great sex would just be the cherry on top of their relationship. \n \nI think Future\u2019s ego is a tad bruised that Ciara upgraded to a guy richer than he is. \n \nThe post Ciara Talks Celibacy And Dating Double Standards appeared first on Jocks And Stiletto Jill .", "source": "Jocks And Stiletto Jill"}
