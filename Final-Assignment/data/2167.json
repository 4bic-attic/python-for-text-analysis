Robert Griffin III suffered a concussion in Week 2 of the preseason vs the Detroit Lions, and Captain Kirk took over the team the following week. \u00a0Head Coach Jay Gruden named him the starting QB, not only for Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins, but for the entire season, saying Kirk made the decision easy with his play. \u00a0Is it finally Cousins chance to take over the team, and show that he is a starting-caliber QB in the NFL? \u00a0He will be given that shot again this season to prove it. \u00a0Now it's time for everyone to support the Washington Redskins starting QB the same way that Tom Compton did above...\n\n \nT-Shirts Available Here\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \nT-Shirts Available Here\n\n \t\n  Poll\n  How many yards will Kirk Cousins throw for this season?\n    \n\n\n    \n        0-999\n    \n        1000-1999\n    \n        2000-2999\n    \n        3000-3999\n    \n        4000-1,000,000\n\n\n   \u00a0  0 votes | Results", "source": "Hogs Haven -  All Posts"}
