Elm St. Both requests were previously supported by the Architectural Review Committee. \n\nFirst Ward Alderman Alan Bauer sat in for Mayor Ken Mundy, who was out of town Monday. \n\nCurt Lang, 1st Ward Alderman, and his wife Karen requested facade grants after recently purchasing the former DiMarzio building, with plans to renovate the property with new windows, cleaned side brick, new roofing materials, gutters and downspouts. \n\nThe estimated cost of the renovations is $40,000. \n\nThe measure was approved 7-0, with Lang abstaining. Karen Lang spoke their behalf. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a big undertaking for us and so we\u2019re excited about it,\u201d she told the council. \n\nThird Ward Alderman Steve Braser commended the Langs for renovating the building, which the last time he knew of that happening was 60 years ago. \n\nShawn Thrower, owner of Shawn\u2019s and Princess Alex Ice Cream has requested facade grants for both his businesses. The repairs include replacing the shingled awning, installing roofing materials, adding lights under the awning to brighten the corner, repair and replace front panels, removing signs and painting the wood siding. \n\nThe estimated cost of the exterior renovations are between $10,000 and $12,000. \n\nFunding for the Downtown Facade Grant Fund comes from a $25,000 transfer made from the Hotel/Motel Tax Fund, City Manager Brian Gregory said. \n\n\u201cCurrently, there\u2019s several buildings within the past year that have undergone or are undergoing significant renovation, and the city has assisted with those renovations through the program,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cThe sole source of revenue for the downtown development fund is the $25,000 transfer, and the fund is dedicated toward downtown improvement.\u201d \n\nOnce receipts for the renovations are received by the city, an applicant is eligible for a 50 percent match-up to $5,000 \u2013\u00a0in Thrower\u2019s case, for each property. Since the Langs\u2019 new property has four different addresses attached to the building the grant could total $20,000. \n\n\u201c(Both grants) will take us over our annual allocation,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cHowever, we could amend the budget given there is a fund that is specifically set aside for these types of agreements, but haven\u2019t been utilized in the past.\u201d \nComments", "source": "Daily Chronicle"}
