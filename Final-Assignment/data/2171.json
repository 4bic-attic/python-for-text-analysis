Since the RX-8 was killed off in 2012, fans have been clamoring for a replacement, or an even sportier model in the vein of the old RX-7 \n\n. \n\nThere have been rumors of a rotary return, but given Mazda\u2019s apparent official disinterest in a new sports car, they\u2019ve seemed more like wishful thinking than indicators of the future. That doesn\u2019t mean Mazda isn\u2019t still interested in rotaries, though. The company has a research team working on them, according to Autocar \n\n. \n\nSpeaking to the magazine at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, Mazda president Masamichi Kogai said this dedicated engineering team is working \u201cvery enthusiastically\u201d to bring rotary engines up to the standards of current piston engines. Fuel-consumption and emissions performance were among the drawbacks of previous rotary engines and, in today\u2019s stricter regulatory environment, those factors will likely make or break any potential new rotary-powered model. \n\nRelated: Mazda 6-based coupe with rotary power rumored \n\nKogai would not elaborate on why Mazda is still experimenting with rotary engines. Company officials have repeatedly denied rumors of an RX-7 or RX-8 successor. Over the past few years, Mazda has largely eschewed low-volume models in favor of building up its core range of sedans \u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
