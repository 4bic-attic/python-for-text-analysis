This report examines how the\u00a02016 presidential race would\u00a0be reshaped by a public financing\u00a0system that amplifies\u00a0the voices of small donors in\u00a0our elections.\u00a0The 2016 election will likely\u00a0break all previous campaign\u00a0spending records. But more\u00a0important than the amount\u00a0of money spent is where that\u00a0money is coming from.\u00a0Under our current system,\u00a0courting wealthy mega-donors\u00a0\u2013 who often have different\u00a0priorities and policy preferences\u00a0than most voters\u00a0\u2013 has taken precedence over\u00a0appealing to everyday Americans. It doesn't have to be that way. What if our campaign finance\u00a0system encouraged candidates\u00a0to raise money from everyday\u00a0citizens making small\u00a0contributions? This report examines\u00a0how the 2016 fundraising\u00a0picture through the July\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0(FEC) filing deadline would\u00a0look if a small donor campaign\u00a0finance system were in place,\u00a0where small contributions were\u00a0matched with limited public\u00a0funds for candidates who agree\u00a0to turn down large contributions. This analysis demonstrates\u00a0that under such a system, candidates\u00a0relying on large donors\u00a0would have a powerful incentive\u00a0to shift their fundraising\u00a0strategy to focus on small donors,\u00a0and access to a narrow\u00a0set of wealthy donors or vast\u00a0personal wealth would not determine\u00a0the viability of a presidential\u00a0campaign.", "source": "U.S. PIRG - The Federation of State PIRGs"}
