The single patient compassionate use Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled a 37-year old woman with persistent and unresectable metastatic choriocarcinoma, an aggressive form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Prior to entry into the trial, the patient had received multiple treatments, including laparoscopic hysterectomy, five prior chemotherapy regimens and stem cell transplant.\n\nThe patient was treated with TRC105 dosed 10 mg/kg weekly in combination with Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab) dosed 10 mg/kg every other week. As of the time of the presentation, the patient had completed 7 cycles (28 weeks) of treatment. Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG), a known, reliable marker of disease burden in choriocarcinoma, normalized during the fourth cycle of treatment, decreasing from greater than 3,000 IU/L at treatment initiation to less than 1 IU/L from cycles 4 through 7, indicating an ongoing complete response. \n\nChoriocarcinoma represents the second tumor type known to express high levels of endoglin in which complete durable responses have been observed following treatment with a combination of TRC105 and a VEGF inhibitor. In June 2015, Dr. Steven Attia of the Mayo Clinic reported complete responses in two patients with angiosarcoma, treated with TRC105 and Votrient\u00ae (pazopanib), at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.\n\n\"We have now seen complete responses in two orphan tumor types that overexpress endoglin, choriocarcinoma and angiosarcoma. There are currently limited treatment options for patients with either of these cancers who progress on first-line chemotherapy,\" said Charles P. Theuer, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of TRACON. \"We intend to treat additional patients with GTN in a Phase 2 multicenter trial that we expect to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2015, and to apply for orphan drug status for TRC105 in GTN, as well as soft tissue sarcoma, by the end of the year.\"\n\nAbout Choriocarcinoma1\n\nGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is the term used to describe a group of rare diseases that originate in the placenta and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue. The major histologic entities for this disease include complete molar pregnancy, partial molar pregnancy, invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma. The term gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is used when molar and non-molar pregnancies become malignant, and comprise the morphologic entities of invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma metastasizes hematogenously and can follow any type of pregnancy, but most commonly develops after complete hydatidiform mole. The reported incidence of GTD in the United States is about 110 to 120 per 100,000 pregnancies. The reported incidence of choriocarcinoma, the most aggressive form of GTD, in the United States is about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies. 1Source: National Cancer Institute\n\nAbout TRC105\n\nTRC105 is a novel, clinical stage antibody to endoglin, a protein overexpressed on proliferating endothelial cells that is essential for angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. TRC105 is currently being studied in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials sponsored by both TRACON and the National Cancer Institute for the treatment of multiple solid tumor types in combination with VEGF inhibitors. TRC105 is also being developed in combination with VEGF inhibitor treatments in wet AMD. For more information about the clinical trials, please visit TRACON's website at http://www.traconpharma.com/clinical_trials.php.\n\nAbout TRACON\n\nTRACON develops targeted therapies for cancer, wet AMD and fibrotic diseases. TRACON's current pipeline includes two clinical stage product candidates: TRC105, an anti-endoglin antibody that is being developed for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and choriocarcinoma, and TRC102, a small molecule that is being developed for the treatment of lung cancer and glioblastoma.
