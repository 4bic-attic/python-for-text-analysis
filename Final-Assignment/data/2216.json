(Update + Linux & OS X builds)", "id": "502b2905-ec1c-4990-9fd3-1ce804a77113", "content": "Thank you so much everyone who played and commented on my game with helpful feedback! \nThe feedback was more or less unanimous, which made it a little easier to have a look at the flaws. \n \nIn the new build I\u2019ve focused on making jumping easier by adding a small grace period where you\u2019re able to jump after having walked off an edge. I\u2019ve also made it possible to jump a little earlier before hitting the ground. You can jump higher overall as well, and the triple jump also allows you to move faster \u00a0forwards than when you\u2019re running. \n \n\n More boost in the triple jump!  \nI made some small changes in order to address the slipperiness as well. It\u2019s now possible to take smaller steps when starting movement from a standstill. It\u2019s still easier to move slowly with an analog stick, but this somewhat emulates it for keyboard as well, without making the character feel to slow or unresponsive (I hope). \n \nI\u2019m also trying out an automatic camera solution that will slowly move to behind the character when the player is not manually rotating the camera. It won\u2019t do this whilst the player is jumping, standing still or walking facing the camera. It\u2019s experimental, but more akin to what is commonly seen in platformers, so tell me what you think of it ! \n \n\n Single jumps more useful.  \nI also wanted to tell you that I\u2019ve added a Linux \u2013 and a Mac OS X build that is available for download now as well! \\(o3o)/ w\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6! \n Up & Away  \nAnd finally a shoutout to LarryChupacabra, thanks for playing\u00a0the game and making the video!", "source": "Ludum Dare"}
