His unique style and catchy beats brought in more than 52,000 people to the venue, making it his largest tour stop in the United States so far. Sheeran, who opened for Taylor Swift on her Red Tour at Gillette in 2013, has made a name for himself over the past two years with a lot of mainstream radio play. The thing about Sheeran\u2019s live show is that he performs solo with nothing but his guitar. He doesn\u2019t have a band or a backing track. Instead Sheeran uses a device called a loop pedal that records his voice and guitar and plays it back as he\u2019s going through each song. It\u2019s an impressive feat for any performer, especially one playing a large stadium such as Gillette, however the issue with this is that many of the beats begin to sound repetitive since Sheeran uses his guitar as a drum as well. That being said, any artist who can pull such a hard task off during a live show is definitely worth seeing. Sheeran started his set with \u201cI\u2019m A Mess,\u201d followed by \u201cLego House\u201d and \u201cDrunk.\u201d At one point, he told a story about a Canadian couple who were unhappy with the show because they assumed he was not performing live. Sheeran made it very clear that he was, in fact, completely live send even had the cameras pan in on his looping pedal to prove it. Though many artists need a band or theatrics to make their show a hit, Sheeran didn\u2019t need any of that. The fact that he played alone on a massive stage that appeared to swallow him up from afar, made the entire set feel a lot more intimate. Sheeran made sure to involve the audience and talk with them as if they were his friends. His entire two hour set seemed to be about making everyone comfortable and happy, though he did say he writes a lot of depressing songs that \u201cyou listen to at 2 a.m. with an empty bottle of wine.\u201d \u201cYou sound beautiful, thank you so much,\u201d he told the crowd after asking them to sing along with him. It\u2019s no secret that the 24-year-old has a lot of very famous friends. One of those friends joined him on the Gillette stage on Friday night. Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay and ex-husband of actress Gwenyth Paltrow, took the stage with Sheeran for \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d as well as Coldplay\u2019s \u201cYellow.\u201d Though they were good together, Sheeran was much better off solo as that seems to be his niche. Sheeran ended his set with an encore of \u201cYou Need Me, I Don\u2019t Need You\u201d and \u201cSing.\u201d", "source": "Wicked Local Swansea"}
