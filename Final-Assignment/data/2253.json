This is, however, an issue affecting just one company and there is no evidence to suggest that any other company is involved, let alone that this is an industry-wide issue,\u201d said Hawes. \n \n\u201cConsumers should be reassured that cars sold in the UK must comply with strict European laws. All cars must complete a standard emissions test, which, unlike in the US, is independently witnessed by a government-appointed independent agency. \n \nHawes also predicted that real world testing, as opposed to the current laboratory tests, would become a reality in the UK within the next two years. \n \n\u201cOn the separate on-going debate about real world testing, industry accepts that the current test method for cars is out of date and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and which is more representative of on-road conditions.\u201d \n \nIn a separate BBC interview he told the Today programme that Volkswagen\u2019s actions were \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said he thought it would be an isolated case. \n \n\u201cThat (the VW case) came from a report which looked at a number of manufacturers and only found one,\u201d he said.", "source": "Motor Trader UK"}
