It has a moderate viscosity, good flow properties and an unlimited working life at ambient temperatures. Additionally, this system can be stored at 40-50\u00b0F and does not require freezing.\n\nUnlike typical one part epoxies, EP3RR-80 will cure in 45-50 minutes at 80\u00b0C (175\u00b0F), or in 25-30 minutes at 250\u00b0F. It features low exotherm while curing enabling it to cure in thicker sections up to and beyond a 1/2 inch deep. This dimensionally stable compound forms high strength bonds to metals, composites, ceramics, glass and many plastics. \n\nEP3RR-80 has superb electrical insulation characteristics and delivers a thermal conductivity of 5-6 BTU\u00b7in/(ft\u00b2\u2022hr\u2022\u00b0F) [0.72-0.87 W/(m\u2022K)] at 75\u00b0F. Resistance to water, oils, fuels and many other chemicals is outstanding. Service operating temperature range is -100\u00b0F to +350\u00b0F. \n\nThis compound is widely employed in the electronic, aerospace, specialty OEM and related industries. It is available for use in syringes as well as standard containers ranging from \u00bd pints to gallons.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nJames Brenner\n\nMASTER BOND INC.\n\n154 Hobart Street \n\nHackensack, \n\nNJ 07601-3922\n\nUSA \n\nTel: +1-201-343-8983\n\nFax: +1-201-343-2132\n\nEmail: jbrenner@masterbond.com\n\nWeb: www.masterbond.com", "source": "Process and Control Today"}
