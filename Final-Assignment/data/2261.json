Bar\u00adbara Mikul\u00adski of Mary\u00adland be\u00adcame the third Sen\u00adate Demo\u00adcrat this week to back the agree\u00adment, still nearly a week be\u00adfore Con\u00adgress is back in ses\u00adsion and form\u00adal de\u00adbate over the deal be\u00adgins.\rWith her vote, the Sen\u00adate will be able to up\u00adhold Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama\u2019s veto of any GOP-backed res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion to dis\u00adap\u00adprove of the deal. And if the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is able to win the sup\u00adport of just sev\u00aden more sen\u00adat\u00adors\u2014for a total of 41\u2014there won\u2019t be any res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion passed for him to veto. As it stands, there are\u00a010 un\u00adde\u00adcided sen\u00adat\u00adors.\rIn his ad\u00address, Kerry char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adized many cri\u00adti\u00adcisms of the deal as \u201cmyths,\u201d in\u00adclud\u00ading the ideas that the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion trusts Ir\u00adan, that the deal le\u00adgit\u00adim\u00adizes Ir\u00adan\u2019s quest for nuc\u00adle\u00adar weapons, and that sanc\u00adtions re\u00adlief will make a huge dif\u00adfer\u00adence to Ir\u00adan\u2019s fund\u00ading of un\u00adrest in the Middle East. \u00a0\rIn an in\u00adter\u00adview with CNN just ahead of his speech, a char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adist\u00adic\u00adally staid Kerry pushed back on that last cri\u00adti\u00adcism, re\u00adfut\u00ading the claim that the sanc\u00adtions re\u00adlief will res\u00adult in Ir\u00adan re\u00adceiv\u00ading hun\u00addreds of bil\u00adlions of dol\u00adlars that the re\u00adgime can use to fund ter\u00adror\u00adism.\rHe said the amount Ir\u00adan will take in is closer to $50 bil\u00adlion to $55 bil\u00adlion. And while it\u2019s \u201cprob\u00adably fair\u201d to say some of it will fund \u201cbad or ne\u00adfar\u00adi\u00adous activ\u00adity,\u201d Kerry said, neither he nor the U.S. in\u00adtel\u00adli\u00adgence com\u00admunity be\u00adlieve the funds \u201cwill be de\u00adterm\u00adin\u00adat\u00adive in any way re\u00adgard\u00ading the se\u00adcur\u00adity of the re\u00adgion.\u201d\rMinutes later, Kerry began his ad\u00address by ask\u00ading the audi\u00adence as\u00adsembled to de\u00adcide for them\u00adselves wheth\u00ader the deal is sound. He went on to out\u00adline its vari\u00adous pro\u00advi\u00adsions: to ex\u00adtend Ir\u00adan\u2019s break\u00adout peri\u00adod, cut the de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment of weapons-grade plutoni\u00adum, and give the In\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal Atom\u00adic En\u00adergy Agency ready ac\u00adcess to in\u00adspect Ir\u00ada\u00adni\u00adan fa\u00adcil\u00adit\u00adies, among oth\u00aders.\rIs\u00adrael\u2019s se\u00adcur\u00adity has been of much con\u00adcern to U.S. sen\u00adat\u00adors weigh\u00ading their votes on the deal. The two Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic sen\u00adat\u00adors who\u2019ve come out against it, New York\u2019s Chuck Schu\u00admer and New Jer\u00adsey\u2019s Bob Men\u00aden\u00addez, have done so in no small part be\u00adcause of con\u00adcerns about Is\u00adrael.\rBut in his speech, Kerry sought to as\u00adsure the coun\u00adtry\u2019s sup\u00adport\u00aders that he is its cham\u00adpi\u00adon.\r\u201cI take a back\u00adseat to no one in my com\u00admit\u00adment\u201d to Is\u00adrael\u2019s safety, Kerry said, paint\u00ading the dis\u00adagree\u00adment between Prime Min\u00adis\u00adter Ben\u00adjamin Net\u00adan\u00adyahu and the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion as one of re\u00adspect\u00adful dis\u00adagree\u00adment.\rAlong with Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama, seni\u00ador U.S. de\u00adfense of\u00adfi\u00adcials, and \u201ceven\u201d former Is\u00adraeli of\u00adfi\u00adcials, Kerry said, he be\u00adlieves \u201cthis agree\u00adment puts us on the right path to pre\u00advent Ir\u00adan from ever get\u00adting a nuc\u00adle\u00adar weapon. The people of Is\u00adrael will be safer with this deal, and the same is true for the people throughout the re\u00adgion.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\rKerry re\u00adjec\u00adted the concept that the United States could walk away from the cur\u00adrent deal and re\u00adturn to the bar\u00adgain\u00ading table with Ir\u00adan later on. He pree\u00admpt\u00adively warned mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress that, in the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion\u2019s view, there is no vi\u00adable al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive to the agree\u00adment.\r\u201cTo vote down this agree\u00adment is to solve noth\u00ading, be\u00adcause none of the prob\u00adlems that we are con\u00adcerned about will be made easi\u00ader if it is re\u00adjec\u00adted,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cNone of them. Not Ir\u00adan\u2019s nuc\u00adle\u00adar pro\u00adgram, not Ir\u00adan\u2019s sup\u00adport for ter\u00adror\u00adism or sec\u00adtari\u00adan activ\u00adit\u00adies, not its hu\u00adman-rights re\u00adcord, and not its op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion to Is\u00adrael. To op\u00adpose this agree\u00adment is, wheth\u00ader in\u00adten\u00added or not, to re\u00adcom\u00admend in its place\u00a0a policy of na\u00adtion\u00adal para\u00adlys\u00adis.\u201d", "source": "Government Executive - All Content"}
