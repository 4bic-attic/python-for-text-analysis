That\u2019s because they\u2019re participating in a unique campaign, the #8or8 Challenge, part of the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program. \nYou can join in the #8or8 Challenge by giving $8 or cutting and donating 8 inches of your hair to help create free, real-hair wigs for women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatments. The wigs are distributed through select American Cancer Society wig banks. You can also help by challenging your friends via social media using #8or8 and # BeautifulLengths , tagging @Pantene . \n\nSince its creation in 2006, the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program has collected more than 800,000 ponytails and provided the funds to create more than 42,000 wigs. With the creation of the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund, anyone can support the program and help create more wigs than ever before. \n\nYou can donate via Twitter by retweeting @Pantene\u2019s \u201c Charitweets \u201d for instructions on how to donate to the cause. \n You can also donate through One Today by Google by visiting https://g.co/beautifullengths . \nHair donations must be at least 8 inches long and cannot be bleached, permanently colored or chemically treated though it may be colored with vegetable dyes, rinses or semipermanent dyes. Gray hair is difficult to use in wig making, so the hair should not be more than 5 percent gray. \n\nFor more information and mailing addresses to send hair and monetary donations, please visit www.beautifullengths.com . \n\nOn the Net: North American Precis Syndicate, Inc.(NAPSI)", "source": "Blackshear Times"}
