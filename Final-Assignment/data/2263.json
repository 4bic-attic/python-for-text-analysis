If we're honest, the jury is still out on it. 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA)\nAlthough Toyota has promised it will be a nice evolutionary step from the third-gen product, one thing's for sure: it certainly will feature a revolutionary design. Not just on the outside, either. Looking inside, the cabin is changing in a BIG way. Toyota said in its initial press release that the fourth-gen Prius would benefit from a more luxurious cabin equipped with better materials. But, that's looking harder to believe thanks to Agent 001's detailed photographs. What I will say, however, is that it appears there are quite a lot of screens to display information on.

After you scope out the images below, let us know if you think the interior on the fourth-gen Prius is a STUD or a DUD.\n2015 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA)\nMost Viewed Photos on AutoSpies.com RIGHT NOW!\rFrankfurt Motor Show IAA\nFrankfurt Motor Show Preview\nPorsche 911 (991) REFRESH\nBMW 225xe and 330e\nMercedes-Benz S-Class Cabriolet\rLAST 5 GALLERIES\rAbout the Author\r\"There are two opinions in this world.
