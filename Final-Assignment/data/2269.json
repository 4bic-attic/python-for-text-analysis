Top congressional Democrats exiting a meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday said any temporary funding measure should have a short time-span and that Democrats would demand increases for domestic agencies.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we have equal money for defense and non-defense,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. In the final months of the year, another possible shutdown looms over Obama\u2019s demand that the GOP-led Congress to increase the nation\u2019s borrowing authority.\nWhat is clear is that the once-routine job of advancing a short-term spending bill to keep the government open past an Oct. 1 deadline remains a major headache for House GOP leaders, chiefly Speaker John Boehner. Some hard-right lawmakers and tea partyers are threatening to try to topple the Ohio Republican, a fierce foe of abortion who has held the speakership since January 2011.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen promises to fight tooth and nail on things in the past and it hasn\u2019t really materialized,\u201d said tea party-backed Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. \u201cI think there will be a point where the thin ice breaks.\u201d\nThe ice could be breaking between Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who met for 20 minutes after she returned from meeting with Obama. Aides declined to characterize the session.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., accused Boehner of \u201csubverting our republic,\u201d and working for lobbyists rather than \u201cwhat the constituents of our district want.\u201d\nBoehner\u2019s clear but unstated preference is to pass a temporary funding bill that\u2019s free of the Planned Parenthood controversy. Democrats are sure to filibuster any bill defunding Planned Parenthood should it come to a vote in the Senate, and Obama has promised a veto regardless.\nThe organization, which provides birth control, abortions and various women\u2019s health services, says it\u2019s done nothing wrong.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re pro-life, the last thing you want to do is have the focus changed to the government shutdown ... rather than the activities of Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a Boehner ally. \u201cAt some point in time you\u2019ve got to face reality.\u201d\nThe White House, in a statement released Thursday evening, said Obama called the shutdown threat \u201ca game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\u201d\nAt a closed-door GOP meeting Thursday, Republicans were shown party polling data that showed most Americans haven\u2019t seen the videos and that more Americans associate Planned Parenthood with women\u2019s health than with abortions. The numbers also showed that most Americans don\u2019t want a government shutdown, lawmakers at the meeting said.\nA significant majority of Republicans would support Boehner if he were to press for a temporary bill disentangled from the dispute over Planned Parenthood. But a few dozen of the most conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose any such effort, and some are weighing a challenge to Boehner\u2019s leadership.\nAsked how confident he was that he could defeat an effort to remove him from the post, Boehner said, \u201cVery.\u201d\nOther GOP members say tea party lawmakers have repeatedly driven GOP leaders into unwinnable fights. They highlight the 16-day partial government shutdown over health care two years ago and a failed attempt this year to use a Department of Homeland Security funding bill to reverse Obama\u2019s moves easing the threat of deportation for millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of like their own party,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do anything about it because they\u2019re right-wing Marxists. It\u2019s unpredictable what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nHillary Clinton went on the offensive Thursday, the day after the attack on Planned Parenthood was front and center in a debate of GOP presidential candidates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough to see hateful rhetoric and lies in a presidential debate. But just like the candidates on stage last night, Republicans in Congress want to defund Planned Parenthood. And they\u2019re willing to shut down the federal government to do it, no matter how bad that is for our country,\u201d said the Democratic front runner.\nSo for now, GOP leaders are pushing free-standing bills blocking Planned Parenthood\u2019s money and curbing abortion that are not tied to money to keep the government functioning. In addition, four congressional committees are investigating Planned Parenthood.\nRight to Life\u2019s leaders released a statement this week endorsing a bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., halting federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year. The House plans to approve that bill on Friday, along with another by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., setting criminal penalties for medical providers who don\u2019t try to save babies born live during abortions.\n\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press reporters Stephen Ohlemacher and Erica Werner contributed to this report.", "source": "Local News from Gadsden Times"}
