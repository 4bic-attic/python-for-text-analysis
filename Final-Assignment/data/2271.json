Col. Christopher Kasker tells the newspaper the annual fight is organized by first-year students as a way to build camaraderie after a grueling summer of training to prepare them for plebe life. \n \nHe says upperclassmen overseeing the fight required cadets to wear helmets, but video shows many did not. Some cadets swung pillowcases believed to be packed with their helmets. \n \nKasker says 24 cadets suffered concussions but all have since returned to duty. No cadets have been punished.", "source": "Owen Sound Sun Times"}
