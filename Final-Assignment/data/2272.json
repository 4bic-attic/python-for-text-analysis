Parks Canada has launched a nation-wide program that sees red Adirondack chairs placed in various locations around national parks and historic sites by local staff. For some red chairs, travellers must search the park or historic site to find them, but the hunt is always worthwhile as the views from the chairs are considered the best in each location. See where travellers have found chairs by searching the hashtag #sharethechair on Twitter .", "source": "Sarnia Observer"}
