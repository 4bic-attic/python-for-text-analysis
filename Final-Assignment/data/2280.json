Firemen built the station in 1960; it served as their city\u2019s fire station for 30 years. slideshow Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Joe Lyvers stands inside the old Skidmore fire station soon to be demolished. The station, which is adjacent to his office, was active from 1960 to 1990. slideshow One of the few remnants that indicates the Skidmore building next to the justice of the peace was a fire station is this poster and brochures with applications for the Citibank Fireman\u2019s Credit card program. slideshow The old Skidmore Fire Station has a date with demolition.\n\nThe building, at 303 E. Sullivan St., has not been a fire station since around 1990. It is adjacent to the offices of Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Joe Lyvers, who will shed no tears when a county backhoe does its business.\n\n\u201cSkidmore has a lot of eyesores. Maybe tearing down this one will serve as an example for the rest of the town,\u201d Lyvers says. \u201cIt\u2019s just been sitting there.\u201d\n\nWhen the volunteer fire department moved to a new station, about 10 blocks away, the old building was used for AA meetings.\n\nThe wooden building was the town\u2019s first fire station, built around 1960. It housed two trucks and an ambulance.\n\n\u201cIt was built by donations and firemen labor,\u201d says Ricky Bohac, the current fire chief. \u201cIt\u2019s made of telephone poles, wood and scrap oilfield pipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to think some of these farmers around here would like to have the telephone polls used to reinforce the walls,\u201d Lyvers says.\n\nAbout the only evidence of the building\u2019s former life is a cluster of application brochures for a Citibank American Firefighter credit card.\n\nBehind the station are two, taller poles, once used to house the station\u2019s radio antenna and siren.\n\nBohac recalls when 25 active volunteer firemen would meet at the station every Monday night for training and to perform maintenance on the trucks.\n\n\u201cA lot of our brush trucks were homemade then,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would take a surplus Army truck and add equipment we needed. Sometimes that truck was the only thing that can get to those brush fires.\u201d\n\nToday, the department claims only 15 active members. \u201cWe\u2019re hunting for members,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cScratch a volunteer fireman,\u201d he predicts, \u201cand more than likely you will find an adrenaline junkie.\u201d\n\nBohac doesn\u2019t view the station with much nostalgia.\n\n\u201cWe went through some pretty tough financial times,\u201d he remembers, \u201cbut, we managed to pull through.\u201d\n\nAt Christmas, firemen would decorate the interior for the group\u2019s annual party for members and their families.\n\n\u201cI kinda grew up with it,\u201d he says. It\u2019s the best way to give back to the community.\u201d\n\nBohac has been fire chief since 2000.\n\nOnce Bee County commissioners approve the use of county equipment, the county\u2019s Road and Bridge department will demolish the old station. While not mourning its demise, Bohac does admit \u201cwe had a lot of fun times there.\u201d\n\nBill Clough is a reporter at the Bee-Picayune and can be reached at 343-5222, or at beepic@mySouTex.com.", "source": "My Soutex"}
