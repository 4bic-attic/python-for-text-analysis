And this one did not disappoint. It was full of new items I've never seen before, and made me want to come back when I've got more time to browse. But for now, I know it's there, and for sure, I'll be back.\nNext stop: the park next door.\nIt sits alongside a road I've driven on countless times over the years. I've always wondered what it was like, but never stopped to see it.\nThat changed today!\nThough a highway borders it on one side, and a busy road on the other, there were few people in the park and it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful. I loved strolling through, enjoying the early fall beauty.\nJust those two stops were enough to perk me up and send me on my way for what the rest of the day held.\nIt only took a few minutes of doing something new to refresh me today. I need to do that more often.", "source": "Living By Lysa"}
