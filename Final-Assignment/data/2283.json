It\u2019s how you express and empower yourself. The clothes on your back are just one of the many ways you convey that. A lot of times people try to put style in a box: trendy, preppy, formal, etc. \u2013 but like most things, no one\u2019s style fits inside one little box. \n \n\n \nWith a lot of you starting class, internships and work, you be thinking of whether\u00a0you should try to tweak your style for the new season. After all, you could use your back to school budget to completely overhaul your style, right? It\u2019s tiring trying to keep up with what\u2019s cool or embrace a style that\u2019s not really you; it\u2019s much easier to take time to come into your own and highlight your true self. Remember: this is your year. But if you\u2019re not exactly sure what your style is in the first place, here\u2019s a short 3-step guide to figuring it out! \n How to Find Your Personal Style  \nLook for keywords, not categories \u2013 The terms above \u2013 trendy, preppy, formal \u2013 aren\u2019t going to be complete representations of your unique style. They\u2019re great categories for placing an outfit in, but you likely don\u2019t rep them every single day. Instead, think of how you\u2019d describe yourself, like daring, experimental, laidback. Let these words help you pull clothes off the rack for the dressing room. That way when you look at a piece, you can see whether it will embody your spirit, not put you in a box. \n \nMake tweaks, don\u2019t overhaul \u2013 Be real, how many of you want to start from scratch with your closet at times? I like to think of myself as always evolving, not completely transforming. As humans, it\u2019s practically our jobs to change over time, slow and steady. Style works the same way. If you\u2019ve changed from last year \u2013 you\u2019re willing to take more risks, less into checking in with trends, hoping to come off as more mature \u2013 now is the time to find clothing that reflects that. No need to go too crazy, just add those words to your original list. \n \nPut an end to the comparison game \u2013 Now is the time to be inspired, not envious. Your peers and coworkers\u2019 styles, the blogger of the moment, street style inspiration on Pinterest , there\u2019s a wealth of information out there. But once you stop being inspired and start making comparisons, it\u2019s time to separate yourself form those sources. If you struggle with comparison, try this: the moment your mind begins to compare your look to the one on your digital feed, shut it down. Close your laptop or put your phone in your pocket. You can\u2019t always remove yourself from the person sitting next to you, but when your comparison is digital, it\u2019s best to try a little self-induced timeout. Before logging on, empower yourself with positive thoughts and self-love. \n \nHow do YOU embrace your personal style?
