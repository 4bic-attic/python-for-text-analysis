Try a Cut Crease Eye Makeup Look", "id": "5e60f908-2458-4c12-9c52-a59c79488595", "content": "Search the term \"cut crease\" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of tutorials on the eye makeup look. Just as the name describes, it's a technique used to define the crease by \"cutting\" across it with a contrasting eyeshadow color and little to no blending. \n \n\"If done right, a cut crease will change your makeup game if you have a medium to heavy fold. It lifts your eyes and makes them appear more open,\" says makeup artist and YouTuber Sona Gasparian . \"You instantly lift your eyelids with this technique. And what's great about it is that you can go super soft or really dramatic depending on your mood.\" \n \nIf you're new to the technique, she says a good tip is to keep the intensity on the outer corner of the eyes. \n \n\"Start slow and build the intensity to achieve the most natural look,\" she says. \"The best way is to keep your eyes open when placing your cut crease. Look straight in the mirror and place a line where you want your new fold to appear, and start to build the shadow over the line blending upward.\" \n \nGasparian says she likes to keep her makeup looks natural, so she blends her cut crease a little more than usual and demonstrates it in her Taylor Swift Bad Blood Makeup Tutorial below: \n [embedded content]  \nIf you're looking for more intensity, check out this version by YouTuber ChrisppyMakeup : \n\n[embedded content]  \nHere's another by YouTuber Lauren Curtis that shows the cut crease at it's most basic level: \n\n[embedded content]  \nSee more of what's trending on our new Lipstick Index: \n\n \n Photo by YouTuber MakeupbyAlli", "source": "Glamour US"}
