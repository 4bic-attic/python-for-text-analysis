Our baby is developing normally, it would seem \u2013 everything seems present and correct, and he or she is growing at the correct rate. And the image is much more clear than it was at the first scan at approximately 11 weeks. \n\nWe did find out the gender of the baby and have told some people (mainly family), but we\u2019re not making it widely known. This is mainly because the sonographer wasn\u2019t very confident about whether the baby is a boy or a girl, but also because we don\u2019t want to end up with lots of pink or blue clothes in case we have another child later on. \n\nChristine is still due to give birth in early January. \n\n20 week scan originally appeared on Neil Turner's Blog and is released under a Creative Commons License .
