(WANE) \u2013 FBI agents are in the third day scouring an area along the Maumee River in downtown Fort Wayne. \n \nIt\u2019s unclear what, though, the agents are doing along the river. \n \nSpecial Agent David Crawford said agents began some sort of investigation Monday, but he refused to discuss the investigation. In fact, Crawford said details would not be revealed even after the agents wrap it up \u2013 whenever that is. \n \nCrawford said the community has no reason to be concerned, however. \n \nOn Wednesday, four tents were erected on the natural levee along the Maumee, near the intersection of Edgewayer Avenue and Oneida Street, as agents in two boats floated on the river. At least one diver could be spotted in the river. Red and green buoys were also in the water. Agents had long orange cables next to the tents, and an equipment truck was parked along the roadway just down the hill. \n \nAbout 12 agents could be seen on the scene. \n \nOn Tuesday, The News-Sentinel reported the agents had a rope stretched across the river near the Tecumseh Street bridge, and the Fort Wayne Fire Department also had personnel on the scene. The report said the Rivergreenway on the north side of the river at the bridge was barricaded going west along Edgewater Avenue during the investigation. \n \nAdam O\u2019Connor, spokesman for the Fort Wayne Fire Department, confirmed a crew is helping the FBI but could not discuss in what way.", "source": "WISH-TV"}
