He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. \nDuring an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne  Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: \"Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side.\" \n\nMaradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: \"If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal.\" \n\nThe controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency.    Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: \"If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president.\" \n\nsgl/ro/lp", "source": "Prensa Latina"}
