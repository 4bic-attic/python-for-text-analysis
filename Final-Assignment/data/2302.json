I used the picture frame border and added some real sequins - I think from Kadie too in another kit!!! to add some depth. \u00a0I made a background with card stock and fussy cut (APRIL!) the image that I colored with Copic Markers and Prismacolor Pencils. \u00a0 I worked the other cutouts, flowers, ribbon and twine to create the embellie and sentiment panel. Kadie, thank you for the kit. \u00a0I liked creating with it!", "source": ": : : :    BlueInks Design"}
