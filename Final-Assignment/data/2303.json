Want a ticket to the\u00a0women\u2019s final of the US Open? WELL YOU CAN\u2019T HAVE ONE. For the first time ever, the\u00a0US Open\u00a0women\u2019s singles\u00a0final sold out before the men\u2019s singles final.\nAccording to ESPN,\u00a0there are often empty seats at the women\u2019s final.\u00a0However this year the grand slam hasn\u2019t started yet (it starts on Monday,) and yet\u00a0there are\u00a0no tickets left. And it\u2019s all because of Serena Williams. If Williams wins the finals of the US Open she will be the first\u00a0woman to win all four grand slams in a single season since Stefi Graff (Graff did so back in 1998). On top of all her glory on court,\u00a0Serena Williams has been winning battles off court too.\u00a0\u00a0She recently called out body shamers who referred to her as \u2018manly\u2019.?= display_ad('x18', 'hidden-xs hidden-md mm_incontent', 'MM In Content'); ??= display_ad('x20', 'visible-xs mm_mob_incontent', 'MM In Content (Mobile)'); ? (Post continues after the video)\u2026 Williams took to the media to call out her body shamers, telling America\u2019s\u00a0abc\u00a0news, \u201cI just don\u2019t have time to be brought down. I have too many things to do, you know. I have Grand Slams to win. I have people to inspire. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d And in other sporting news this week\u2026 Our women\u2019s cricket team, The Southern Stars, have regained the Ashes by defeating England on home turf. The host\u2019s secured a five-wicket win over Australia in Cardiff last Monday, but it wasn\u2019t enough to take out the test. The Southern Stars had already secured the Women\u2019s Ashes overall in the multi-format series with a 20-run win at Hove on the 28th August. \u00a0Australia thrashed England by 161 runs in an earlier test in the series. Australia\u2019s women\u2019s water polo team has finished in a disappointing fourth place at the Kazan World Championships, leaving the Stingers coach Greg McFadden with some difficult decisions to make ahead of an Olympic training camp. \u00a0Training at the mid-September camp will give the players and coaches time to re-group before the 21-member squad is cut down to a final 13 for the Olympic team.\nFinally to netball, Melbourne Vixens defender Jo Weston will be joining the Diamond\u2019s squad for Australia\u2019s four-test Constellation Cup against New Zealand next month. The 15-player squad includes nine players returning from Australia\u2019s World Cup victory in August and four debutants, including 21-year-old Weston. The team will head to Christchurch for the series starting on October. What spot have you been watching or playing this week? Join the conversation No comments", "source": "Mamamia"}
