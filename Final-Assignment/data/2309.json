This sparked a fire in Lightfoot, which sent him into the air on the very next wave. Not to be outdone, goofy-footed (surfs with his right foot forward) Faulkner launched a backhand air to reverse but was unable to hold on. Three waves ridden with back-to-back air 360\u2019s, a fitting climax to what was a very successful event. \n\n\u201cIt was a really cool event,\u201d commented a stoked Lightfoot afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice coming to Mossel Bay, I seem to always get good results here and the waves are usually really fun!\u201d \n\nNicole Pallet (KZN) took out the highly completive U/20 Girls division ahead of Ollie Brand and Sophie Bell.
