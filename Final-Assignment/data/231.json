I changed the oil, the cabin air filters and I gave the car a general checkup. \n \nI\u2019m fortunate to have access to a lift, and took advantage of that to inspect the suspension and other areas under the car. Bavarian Auto has an excellent three part video that tells you exactly what to look for \u2014 here\u2019s one of the episodes: \n \n\n \nThankfully the M5 looks to be in great shape. There was no play in any of the suspension\u00a0 areas\u00a0 as described in the video. A previous owner installed a Bilstein PSS9 coilover suspension about 10,000 miles prior to me purchasing the car in 2011, so I expected those parts to be in good order. I have also replaced both the front and the rear control arms. \n \nAs BMWs age there is a list of maintenance items you need to keep track of to keep your car performing as it should.

It\u2019s even better being able to determine that for myself, using online resources like the BavAuto videos. \n \nFilters old and new \n \nPriming the oil canister \n \nCabin filter driver side \n \nFront rotor \n \nRear suspension \n Leave Blank: Do Not Change: \nYour email: \n\n\n\u00a0 \n \nThe post E39 M5 Fall Checkup appeared first on chrisparente.com .", "source": "GovZine"}
