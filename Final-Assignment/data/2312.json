Jermey Montrell Elliott, who was 35, was being pursued by several of Alabama\u2019s Escambia County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies when the wreck occurred near Baker around 12:30 a.m. The chase started in Flomaton, Alabama, entered into Escambia County, Florida, and continued through Santa Rosa County into Okaloosa County. Elliott was driving at speeds of about 100 miles per hour when he entered Okaloosa County, with three Alabama patrol cars in pursuit, according to an Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report. An Okaloosa deputy saw the chase and had been advised by his supervisor that he was only there to as-sist, but not to pursue, the report said. He followed the flashing lights to 1414 Aaron Baker Road, where he saw the red Dodge Dakota that Elliott had been driving. It had rolled onto the driver\u2019s side and struck a tree. Elliott was trapped in the truck and pronounced dead at the scene. He was not wearing a seatbelt, ac-cording to the Florida Highway Patrol media release. Several firearms were located in the truck, including two loaded pistols, one shotgun and one loaded AR-15 rifle. A brown backpack containing what appeared to be marijuana and about $2,000 were also found, ac-cording to the OCSO incident report. The items were taken into custody by the Escambia County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u00a0", "source": "Northwest Florida Daily News"}
