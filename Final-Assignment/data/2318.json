The balance sheet carrying value of its Alaska position is about $3 billion, with additional future contractual commitments of about $1.1 billion, The Hague, Netherlands-based energy explorer said. \n\nShell is abandoning exploration after winning approval in August to drill the Burger J well in\u00a0Alaska\u2019s Chukchi Sea. Success would have brought the company back to an area it left three years ago after a rig ran aground. That incident helped prompt the Obama administration to revisit U.S. rules for exploration in the region, while environmental groups have long- protested Shell\u2019s plans, saying a spill could cause an ecological disaster. \n\nIndications of oil and gas at the Burger J well weren\u2019t sufficient to warrant further exploration, according to the Shell statement. The company holds a 100 percent working interest in 275 Outer Continental Shelf blocks in the\u00a0Chukchi Sea, it said. \n\n\u201cShell will now cease further exploration activity in offshore Alaska for the foreseeable future,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis decision reflects both the Burger J well result, the high costs associated with the project, and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska.\u201d \n\nAlaska held almost 9 percent of the proved crude oil reserves in the U.S. in 2013, or about 2.9 billion barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. Dry natural gas reserves were 7,316 billion cubic feet, or about 2 percent of the national total.", "source": "La Repubblica"}
