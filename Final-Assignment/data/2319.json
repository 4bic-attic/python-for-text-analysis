And with Mad Max review codes delayed until launch day, I\u2019d pretty much written it off as another disaster.\n\nNot so! I haven\u2019t ran through a huge chunk of Mad Max yet, but from what little I\u2019ve played it appears to be both stunningly competent and well-optimized. I\u2019ve been at PAX so I don\u2019t have a decent desktop rig nearby to test it on, but I managed to eke out a solid 45+ frames per second at High settings even on the old Blade Pro\u2019s GTX 860M.\n\nSteam reviews seem to concur, with reports of 60+ frames per second at Ultra on a 660 Ti and 100+ frames per second (presumably on Ultra) on a 980/980 Ti. And I\u2019m not seeing widespread reports of problems with AMD hardware, so hopefully that means Team Red is on par with Nvidia for this launch.\n\nNow, whether the game itself is any good? I don\u2019t know. What I\u2019ve played so far feels like a pretty standard open-world game with a Mad Max twist which is\u2026well, pretty much exactly what I expected. But we\u2019ll have a more comprehensive review as soon as we\u2019re able, if you want to hold off.\n\nEither way, props to Avalanche for putting out a PC game that actually works as advertised on launch day, and doing it under the WB umbrella no less. Hopefully this bodes well for Just Cause 3\u2019s December launch also.", "source": "Computerworld Singapore"}
