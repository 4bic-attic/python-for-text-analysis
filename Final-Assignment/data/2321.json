Chapman says investigators knew where at least two of them were and were looking for the possible third. \n \nMultiple shots were fired about 8:30 a.m. at the corner of East Cornell Drive and North Duke Drive as children waited for the bus, Chapman says. \n \nThe area where the shooting occurred is a few blocks off Sterling Boulevard, which is home to multiple county schools. Park View High is just a few-minute drive away. \n \nSchool officials took extra security precautions including keeping the school locked down throughout the day and additional\u00a0police patrols at dismissal. \n \nStudents \u201cstayed in first period all day,\u201d Byard says. \n \nSix other nearby schools were placed on \u201clockout mode,\u201d which means the exterior doors of the school are locked, but normal school activities continue. It differs from lockdown mode, under which interior doors are locked and students must stay in their classrooms. \n \nCrisis counselors will be on hand all next week to help students, Byard says. \n \n\u201cThis is the first time a lot of these students have dealt with death. So you can image emotions are rather high right now,\u201d he says. \n \nWTOP\u2019s Neal Augenstein and Michelle Basch contributed to this report from Sterling, Virginia. \n \nThe post appeared first on WTOP .", "source": "WTOP"}
