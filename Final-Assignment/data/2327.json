They have a very astute coach in Eddie Jones, and our players who play in Japan have warned us to expect a very high tempo game and good, low tackling to stop momentum. \n \n\"The players know that nothing but their best will be good enough on Saturday, and we realise the importance of starting the World Cup on a good note. \n \n\"But having said that, we also know that there is no such thing as an easy game in rugby any more, and they will be just as fired up as us.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nSouth Africa team (versus Japan): Z Kirchner; L Mvovo, J Kriel, J de Viliers (capt), B Habana; P Lambie, R Pienaar; T Mtawarira, B du Plessis, J du Plessis, L de Jager, V Matfield, F Louw, W Alberts, S Burger. \n \nReplacements: A Strauss, T Nyakane, C Oosthuizen, P-S du Toit, S Kolisi, F du Preez, H Pollard, JP Pietersen.", "source": "Thurrock Gazette"}
