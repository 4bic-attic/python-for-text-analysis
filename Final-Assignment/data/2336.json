Customer Reviews but they are very comfortable and much lighter than my other golf shoes 2 of 2 people found the following review helpful \u00a0on July 13, 2014 By Brian Mullins I bought a half size larger than I wear for running shoes, but they are very comfortable and much lighter than my other golf shoes. Nike Golf Men\u2019s Lunar Express High Performance Golf Shoe 3 of 4 people found the following review helpful \u00a0on August 24, 2014 By Donald K Wentworth, Jr The golf shoe fits nicely even though I only normally wear a size 13. I needed a size 15 for the show to be comfortable. They are very light and seem very durable. I have played several rounds of golf wearing them and my feet do not slip when swinging the club. In fact, I hard know that they are on my feet because they are so light Fantastic shoe. Like wearing a running shoe 1 of 1 people found the following review helpful \u00a0on September 18, 2014 By doug pedersen Fantastic shoe. Like wearing a running shoe. Excellent traction. Looking excellent \u00a0on July 29, 2014 By CptZach \"zraines\" Found these online for cheaper, 11.5 size was just a tad small but bought some shoe trees to stretch them out. I reckon they look fantastic and did play very well with them the first outing. Awesome shoes Fantastic design and extraordinary comfort \u00a0on July 31, 2014 By Frank Bayno Fantastic design and extraordinary comfort. Like walking around in slippers. Probably 1/2 size extra needed to delight in the right fit. Try a pair at your local golf shop then order the one for you Comfortable right out of the box \u00a0on April 24, 2015 By Dragondoc Comfortable right out of the box. Don\u2019t notice any difference between these and the soft spike brands I\u2019ve owned in terms of traction and grip. Like the style. Fantastic shoe. \u00a0on May 29, 2015 By Michael Lawshe Fantastic shoe\u2026 Very light and comfortable\u2026 I was curious to see how they would be without spikes but I don\u2019t feel much difference when swinging Sure liked the look and color \u00a0on September 14, 2014 By john blair Sure liked the look and color, but toe box was a bit narrow. Probably would have been ok if I didn\u2019t need them for walking! A fantastic light weight golf shoe \u00a0on May 7, 2015 By Oliver A fantastic light weight golf shoe. it\u2019s like walking on a cloud. But, with the support required for a day at the course.
