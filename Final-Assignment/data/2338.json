I grew up outside the city in a small town in Connecticut, and love taking the train into New York to enjoy the hustle-and-bustle sights and sounds of a city that never sleeps. \nRecently, I met a friend of mine in New York City to walk around and make a stop to my new favorite restaurant in Little Italy. He\u2019s not as into photography as I am so I opted for a smaller camera bag with less gear. I only took one body, one lens, a cell phone tripod, and 2 Platypod Pro portable tripods. \n[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"59658\"]\nWalking Around\nWith less gear, my bag was super-lightweight and it wasn\u2019t bad carrying it around all day. We ended up covering a lot of ground\u2026We arrived in Grand Central Terminal, then hiked up to Rockefeller Center before jumping into Central Park to explore the large reservoir.\n[youtube=https://youtu.be/tTKgJf5OGoA]\nAfter some photos and a timelapse, we hopped on the subway and rushed downtown to World Trade Center and Battery Park just in time for sunset. Using everything I brought, I set up a timelapse of the new One World Trade Center building with my Nikon D7000, and then used my iPhone 6 Plus to shoot a timelapse of the sun setting across the Hudson River.\u00a0Timelapsing takes time, and since you\u2019re waiting anyway it\u2019s helpful to have multiple cameras to shoot different angles.\u00a0\n[youtube=https://youtu.be/JP5-czgm8Hs]\n\nI shot raw with the D7000, making it possible to pick a frame and process it, for the image below.\n\n[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"59685,59690\"]\nI was impressed with the Platypod Pro when I first saw it in Las Vegas. After shooting with it, I can see myself carrying at least one with me in my bag everywhere I go. It\u2019s so small and light, but stable enough to hold a DSLR with a zoom lens and keep it steady anywhere. \n\nBonus Tip\nThe Platypod Pro comes in a cool little carrying case, but there\u2019s no need to carry two cases around. These are small enough that you can fit multiple Platypod\u2019s in just one case.\n*Behind the scenes shot taken by Mike Lano.\n\n\n\nNick Minore\u00a0is a video professional\u00a0and avid photographer based in Florida.
