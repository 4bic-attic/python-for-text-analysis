A mercenary named Parsifal (Michael Sopkiw) Parsifal is hired by the Federation and the President of the Pan American Confederacy (Edmund Purdomto) to infiltrate New York City, which is controlled by the Euraks, to rescue the only fertile woman left on Earth. Along on the trip he is assigned with to men, Ratchet (Romano Puppo) and Bronx (Paolo Maria Scalondro) to help him with his mission. The trio will have to face all sorts of danger lurking around in New York on their mission...\"\n\n\u201c2019 - After the Fall of New York\" (\"2019 - Dopo la caduta di New York\") is a 1983 Italian science fiction film directed by Sergio Martino in both English and Italian. It is of the post-apocalyptic Italian genre similar to the films \"1990 The Bronx Warriors\", \"Blastfighter\", and \"Endgame\". This is of course a poor man\u00b4s mish mash of particularly \"Mad Max 2 - The Road Warrior\" and \"Escape From New York\", but compared to \"1990 The Bronx Warriors\" (which is ok from a perspective of the genre itself), this is pretty poor I must say. The effects are, well... hardly good, the action comic, the dialogue wooden, the acting shoddy and the crappy models of the city landscape is something extra. Even the bloody names are horrible. Parsifal? I reckon the only thing I did like was to see Anna Kanakis (\"The New Barbarians\") again. Nah, this is a pass in my book, unless you are a true Italian exploitation fan.
