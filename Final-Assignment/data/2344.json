I have written about the walk separately in my blog inspiringartwalkswithsarahmorley.blogspot.co.uk. \u00a0Do have a look and leave me some feedback!\u00a0 This little painting is one of my favourites. It shows the top of the plateau - it is the highest point yet it is just flat with various rocks lying around. I love the colours in this one! It is an original palette knife painting, oil on board, and ships anywhere in the world within the all inclusive price. Great Value!
