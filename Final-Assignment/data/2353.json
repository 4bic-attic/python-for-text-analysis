Although jovial founder, Carla, has had this piece of property near and dear to her heart for many years, her family became the official owners about six months ago. \u201cI used to come here\u00a0for dinner with my family and it has always been a dream of mine to someday own this beautiful and historic land,\u201d Bartolucci said. \n \n\nAlong with revealing the plans for the new jovial warehouse and administrative building, Carla also took the time to thank the many people who helped her dream come to fruition. \u00a0This included the \u00a0project\u2019s\u00a0architect, Friedrich St. Florian, whose very prestigious resume\u00a0includes\u00a0designing the WWII Memorial in Washington, DC. \u00a0Frederich explained that after spending time with Carla in Italy to discuss plans\u00a0and then walking the site together in Connecticut,\u00a0he was able to fully\u00a0appreciate the vision that Carla had for the John Randall homestead.\u00a0He knew she was the perfect person to bring the inspiring piece of property back to life and back to it\u2019s full potential. \n \n\n \nRandall\u2019s Ordinary is anything but ordinary, built circa 1685, the house\u00a0is on the National Register of Historic Places and one of North Stonington\u2019s most\u00a0famous sites. \u00a0In her speech on Thursday, Carla explained that she holds the property dear to her heart and although changes will be made, the\u00a0historic integrity of\u00a0the land will be honored and respected completely. She also added that the Randall homestead\u00a0is the perfect place for jovial\u2019s mission to unfold, looking to the past for a better future. \n \nState Representative Diana Urban and First Selectman Nick Mullane were also there to join Carla, her family, Fredrich and John Carlin of Carlin Construction Company\u00a0in the first official dig. \u00a0The\u00a0concrete work will commence as early as November, and the grand opening of the office and warehouse will be in the early summer of 2016. \u00a0Following the company relocation, work will begin to restore the\u00a0inn so that Carla can begin her Culinary Getaways in Connecticut. The inn was originally constructed in an Old World barn that was transported to the site from upstate New York. The beautiful timber frame structure will house 10 guest rooms, and jovial will be building an additional that will include a large kitchen, dining area, and an outdoor courtyard. Following completion of the inn renovation, the company will set it\u2019s sites toward the 1685 home and adjacent barn. \n \n\n \nTo celebrate the release of her new cookbook, Einkorn: Recipes for Nature\u2019s Original Wheat , Carla prepared\u00a0a selection of 10 savory and sweet recipes to serve after the ceremonies. \u00a0Carla told the story of the company beginnings and how much it means to her to meet her customers face-to-face at the villa in Italy and how excited she is to do the same in Connecticut. She concluded her speech by inviting people to try einkorn: \u201cI wanted to tell you that I baked for you. How many people here have tasted einkorn? Well, today, you are going to taste the oldest food that there is.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \nFollowing the ceremony Carla and all those who helped make her dream happen, gathered under the tent and together celebrated the next chapter for North Stonington and, of course, Jovial Foods. It was a great way to end an exciting evening. \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0", "source": "Jovial Recipes \u00bb Blog"}
