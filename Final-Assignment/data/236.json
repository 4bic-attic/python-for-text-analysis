It was all very awkward. \n  \nWhere's Jeremy Kyle with an intervention when you need him #CBB  #cbbuk \n \n\u2014 AISLEYNE (@Aisleyne1) September 15, 2015 \n \nAnyway\u2026back to the point. \n \nThe first eviction of the night saw Scoop say bye-bye and take his top off. It got very weird very quickly. \n  \nScoop is out!

Katie Hopkins had actually been right about something. \n  \n@KTHopkins  @TheSun  @TheSunTV No. I'd rather have my finger & toe nails removed by a pliers!! \n \n\u2014 Anonyman (@MensTroubles) September 15, 2015 \n  \nOne for all of @KTHopkins doubters: Katie has correctly predicted the General Election, Labour Leadership Race and tonight's #CBB Eviction. \n \n\u2014 Kathryn (@Kathryn0291) September 15, 2015 \n \nShe also predictably tweeted a rather rude comment about the former housemate. Sigh. \n  \nSay bye bye Gail. You have let being bald determine who you are #CBB \n \n\u2014 Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) September 15, 2015 \n   \n Share article  \n    \nIs a world where Katie Hopkins is right really worth living in?
