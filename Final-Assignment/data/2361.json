The losses followed a near 30 percent plunge in its London-listed arm after online brokerage Investec warned about the impact of soft commodity prices on the group\u2019s future. \n \n\u201cWe know all their businesses including agricultural, energy, or mining, all are in trouble,\u201d securities analyst Jackson Wong told Agence France-Presse. \n \n\u201cThey are in a very tough situation . . .\u201d said Wong, associate director at Simsen Financial Group. \n \nRush to safety \nOther resources firms also sank. In Sydney BHP Billiton plunged 6.65 percent and Rio Tinto shed 4.57 percent, while Origin Energy plunged 10.43 percent and Santos gave up more than 9 percent. \n \nIn Tokyo, oil firm JX Holdings lost 4.32 percent and Kubota\u2014which makes tractors and heavy equipment\u2014fell 7 percent. Industrial robot maker Fanuc, which has close links to China, was down 3.8 percent. \n \nThe losses dragged all Asia\u2019s bourses lower. Tokyo was down 4.05 percent at the close, while Sydney shed 3.8 percent. Hong Kong lost 2.97 percent and Shanghai was 2.02 percent lower. Wellington and Singapore both shed more than 1 percent. \n \nMarkets in New York and Europe were equally sideswiped Monday. The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all saw hefty selling, while London, Frankfurt and Paris each lost more than 2 percent. \n \nForeign exchange dealers also fled to assets such as the yen which are considered safe in times of turmoil. The dollar fell to 119.37 yen from 119.93 yen Monday in New York, while the euro slipped to 134.54 yen against 134.83 yen. \n \nOn currency markets the resources-linked Australian dollar was down 0.6 percent against the US dollar at 69.48 cents, around six-year lows. \n \nThe South Korean won fell 0.58 percent against the US unit, the Thai baht shed 0.19 percent and Indonesia\u2019s rupiah was 0.26 percent lower. Malaysia\u2019s ringgit was down 1.2 percent. \n \nThe rupee eased 0.11 percent after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised analysts by lowering borrowing costs more than expected to try to shore up a tentative economic recovery. \n \nTuesday\u2019s move was the fourth by the RBI this year. \n \nOil prices edged up after losing around 2.5 percent Monday. \n \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate added 0.05 percent to $44.45 and Brent was 0.19 percent up at $47.43. \n \nAFP \n \r\n\r \r \r\n\r \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r \r\n        \r\n\t\t\r \r\n\r \n\n\r\n\r \r \n\r\n\r \n \n\r\n\r\n\r \r \n [embedded content] \r\n\r \n\r \r \n  \r\n            \r \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r Columnists  \nThe US surrenders on AIIB (and that\u2019s a generally good thing) \nBEN KRITZ \nROUGH TRADE \n\nGoing the way of horses? \nREAL CARPIO SO \nMANAGING FOR SOCIETY \n\nPNCC does not pay \nEMETERIO SD.
