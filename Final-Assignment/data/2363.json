This has caused civil libertarians and others to praise Apple for offering privacy to make eavesdropping impossible.\nBut as Matthew Green explains, this is not really true. Apple has engineered the system so that it can spy on messages any time it wants to. Apple can comply with the DoJ requests by just turning on its own spy capabilities. Apple declined to comment on the case for this article. But company officials have argued publicly that the access the government wants could be exploited by hackers and endanger privacy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another attack on our civil liberties that we see heating up every day \u2014 it\u2019s the battle over encryption,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, told a conference on electronic privacy this year. \u201cWe think this is incredibly dangerous.\u201d\nEchoing the arguments of industry experts, he added, \u201cIf you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too.\u201d If criminals or countries \u201cknow there\u2019s a key hidden somewhere, they won\u2019t stop until they find it,\u201d he concluded.\nI believe that users have a right to end-to-end encryption, the govt should not be able to force weakened encryption. But that is not the situation here. People are willingly using an Apple system that allows Apple spying. The DoJ is just asking, with a court order against criminal suspects, for the access that Apple has already engineered in.\nI think that Apple should either offer true privacy or comply with the DoJ.", "source": "Singular Values"}
