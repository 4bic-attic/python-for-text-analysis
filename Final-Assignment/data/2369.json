Washington St. near downtown Wakarusa. \n \nThis annual tradition, more generally known as \u201cNational Anthem Day\u201d for the school, began as a way to educate the students on the significance of the song, \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d which was penned in 1814 by Francis Scott Key as the War of 1812 was ending. \n \nAccording to vocal music teacher Shawn Skaggs, the realization that so few knew of the powerful message behind the lyrics was worth taking the time to educate. \n \n\u201cThe idea to start National Anthem Day came from a national poll which showed less than 40 percent of Americans today know the words to their national anthem, and many have little understanding of the meaning behind the text, and why they hear it sung or played at events across America,\u201d Skaggs explained. \n \nThis year marks the eighth commemoration of the event, \u201cand it continues to be something the students look forward to yearly,\u201d she added. In the days prior to this ceremony, the children spend time learning about the history of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d as well as \u201cthe poetic language of the lyrics, the correct note values and melody, and the proper behaviors to demonstrate whether it\u2019s sung or played,\u201d Skaggs said. \n \n\u201cThis day has really become a chance for our students to reflect on what they\u2019re truly thankful for in their everyday lives and what freedom means. Students have also learned and will present other patriotic songs demonstration their knowledge of our country\u2019s heritage through music,\u201d she said. The entire community is welcome to attend, with particular reverence for those who have been or are currently in service to America. \n \nFor more information, contact Wakarusa Elementary School at 574-862-2000 or connect with Skaggs via email at sskaggs@wanee.org .", "source": "Goshen News"}
