You try to speak to him and tell him a certain way to do things but it's about emotions really,\" said the 31-year-old. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"People are emotional and you do silly things and when you're on Twitter it is there and you can voice your opinions. \n\n\"If he had sat quietly for 48 hours he wouldn't have done it, but it's just emotions at the time.\" \n\nThe game was forgettable, Berahino's return apart, as Jay Rodriguez wasted Southampton's best chance and Callum McManaman had a penalty appeal turned down for the hosts but was criticised by boss Tony Pulis for diving. \n\nVirgil van Dijk impressed in his Saints debut after a \u00a313million switch from Celtic and the Dutch defender hopes his move can improve his international prospects. \n\nHe said: \"That's something for the future. I've been called up for second game now and didn't play, so I'm close but not close enough but just need to keep improving. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"I just played my first game in the Premier League and kept a clean-sheet, which you never know what happens next week, but we just need to keep going. Keep the good team spirit high. \n\n\"It means a lot to play for Ronald Koeman, it's an honour for me. He was an amazing player. He played for the biggest clubs. I think I can learn a lot off him. \n\n\"He was a coach at the biggest clubs, so I'm very happy and can't wait to keep him improving.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Ballymoney Times"}
