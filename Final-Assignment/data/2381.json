A spokeswoman said the cottage in the palace grounds is currently being redecorated and could provide room for a \"family or two\". She said: \"As a Christian who leads the Church of England it is something he feels absolutely passionate about. \"As the archbishop has said, Jesus was a refugee, and there are refugees here who are desperate for sanctuary from war-torn places and the archbishop is completely torn about their situation and wants to make a difference.\"\n\t The rent for the refugees will be paid for by charitable funds under the archbishop's personal control, the Sunday Times said.", "source": "Cairns Post"}
