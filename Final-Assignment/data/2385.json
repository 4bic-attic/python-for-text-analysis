Then with time running out in the first half, the Warriors quarterback, TJ Nixon, looked to get his team on the board, but he was just a few yards short of a touchdown heading into halftime. \n\nThe Warriors looked like they were about to jump back in this one, but it was the Rams who struck first in the second half taking a 13-0 lead after TyQuan Beckett blocked the extra point kick. Parkside also scored another touchdown on 4th down late in the third quarter, however, it was taken back due to illegal formation at the beginning of the play - there was a personal foul was called on the Easton Warriors and that led to another first down for the Rams. The same drive continued heading into the fourth quarter and Easton's Chris Breen recovered a fumble in the end zone to give it the Warriors some life early in the fourth quarter. \n\nHowever, the Rams defense held off the Warriors to get the 15-7 victory.", "source": "WMDT ABC-47"}
