Night Shyamalan\u2019s strangely creepy, suspenseful tale of a brother and sister who spend a week on their maternal grandparents\u2019 remote Pennsylvania farm. Realizing that their recently divorced mother (Kathryn Hahn) needs a vacation, teenage Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her exuberant, rap-loving, younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) encourage her to take a Royal Caribbean cruise with her boyfriend. Having disapproved of their mother\u2019s marriage to their father, the grandparents have been estranged for years and have never met the grandkids, but are now eager to mend the relationship. So aspiring filmmaker Becca intends to make a documentary about this experience. Meeting the train, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) are, admittedly, a bit odd. Nana\u2019s always baking and laughs hysterically in a rocking chair, facing the wall. And Pop Pop can be unexpectedly curt, cautioning them to never leave their bedroom after 9:30 p.m. Hearing strange nocturnal noises, they peek out and spy Nana wandering around nude, clawing the walls. Pop Pop explains that she\u2019s \u201csundowning,\u201d a medical term referring to dementia patients\u2019 reacting restlessly or aggressively when evening approaches. Becca functions as the compassionate commentator as they curiously explore their mother\u2019s childhood home and come to realize how age has impaired their grandparents\u2019 functionality, resulting in bizarre behavior. Utilizing weird camera angles and a \u201cfound footage\u201d gimmick, Shyamalan then delivers a stunning twist to this intense family drama. In 1999, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan catapulted into pop culture with \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d followed by \u201cSigns,\u201d \u201cThe Village\u201d and \u201cUnbreakable.\u201d Unfortunately, his next four films \u2014 \u201cLady in the Water,\u201d \u201cThe Happening,\u201d \u201cThe Last Airbender\u201d and \u201cAfter Earth\u201d \u2014 misfired. Collaborating on TV\u2019s quirky \u201cWayward Pines,\u201d Shyamalan learned how to create chaotic visual energy with fewer resources. Which led to this comedic thriller, financed with $5 million of his own money. Once dubbed \u201cthe next Spielberg\u201d by Time magazine, Shyamalan is the highest-profile director to team up with micro-budget producer Jason Blum (\u201cInsidious,\u201d \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d). On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, \u201cThe Visit\u201d is a spooky, scary 6. As Nana says, \u201cYou have to laugh to keep the deep darkies in a cave.\u201d\nVisit www.susangranger.com\nfor more about movies and entertainment.
