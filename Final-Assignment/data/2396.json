Millions of grains of sand are painstakingly laid into place on a flat platform over a period of days or weeks to form the image of a mandala. To date the monks have created mandala sand paintings in more than 100 museums, art centers, and colleges and universities in the United States and Europe.\u00a0Traditionally most sand mandalas are destroyed shortly after their completion. This is done as a metaphor for the impermanence of life. \n\nThis event is held in conjunction with the McClung Museum's special exhibit,\u00a0Embodying Enlightenment: Buddhist Art of the Himalayas.\u00a0 \n\nEmail\u00a0or call the museum at (865) 974-2144 for more information.", "source": "The University of Tennessee, Knoxville"}
