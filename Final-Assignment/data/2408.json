I\u2019d like to offer up my congratulations and wish them the best as they prepare to continue their quest towards winning a regional title, but also thank them for consistently helping us to reinforce the UK\u2019s reputation as the home of the world\u2019s best fish and chips.\u201d\n\nThe awards will be handed out at the Lancaster London Hotel on January 20 next year.", "source": "Plymouth Herald"}
