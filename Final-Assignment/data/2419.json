I had just enough time to secure some conclusive photos before the visibility decreased and the whale disappeared into the gloom.\" \n\nThe last sighting of a blue whale so close to the UK occurred in September 2008 when one of the animals was photographed off south-west Ireland. \n\nBlue whales were hunted to near-extinction in the north-east Atlantic in the early 20th century but experts believe the population is slowly starting to recover and moving into new areas. \n\nDr Veerle Huvenne, also from the NOC and the expedition's chief scientist, said: \"There was huge excitement on board as many people got a glimpse of their first blue whale. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"The Biscay margin is already recognised as a hotspot for whales, dolphins and seabirds - our new data further underline the importance of this area for iconic marine life.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "Hemel Hempstead Gazette"}
