Instead, they ate items like \u201clandfill salad,\u201d \u201cchickpea water\u201d and \u201crepurposed bread bun.\u201d \n\nThe US-themed menu at the UN\u2019s Sunday lunch was prepared by world-renowned chefs, and designed to highlight food waste and how agricultural production contributes to climate change. It was a far cry from Monday\u2019s lunch, where heads of state dined on smoked trout and cucumber timbale, caramelised beef short ribs and spiced wild berry compote. US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin toasted each other with glasses of ros\u00e9 at the luncheon. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the prototypical American meal but turned on its head,\u201d prominent New York chef Dan Barber, who helped design the menu, told AFP. \u201cInstead of the beef, we\u2019re going to eat the corn that feeds the beef. The challenge is to create something truly delicious out of what we would otherwise throw away.\u201d \n\nBarber and former White House chef Sam Kass worked together to create the vegetarian meal. Kass is known as the architect of US First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s anti-obesity campaign called Let\u2019s Move. \n\n\"Our lunch was produced from food that would otherwise end up in landfills, emitting methane, a potent greenhouse gas,\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban told reporters. \n\nFood production and agriculture contribute as much to climate change as transportation does, he noted. \nREAD MORE: Americans trash about 1/3 of their food, worth $161bn - USDA \n\u201cMore than a third of all food produced worldwide \u2012 over one billion tonnes of edible food each year \u2012 goes to waste,\u201d Ban said. \u201cThat is shameful when so many people suffer from hunger.\" \n\nAccording to UN figures, more than a quarter \u2012 28 percent \u2012 of agricultural lands around the world go to produce food that is lost or wasted, the equivalent of 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon responsible for climate change. \n\nSo Barber and Kass composed lunch items out of compost. The \u201clandfill salad\u201d was made from unwanted vegetable scraps salvaged from the waste of big food producers, rejected apples and pears, and dressed with the liquid drained from a can of chickpeas. \u201cSpent grain bread\u201d was baked from grain mash normally tossed out by brewers and distilleries. \n\nThe veggie burger consisted of \u201coff-grade vegetables,\u201d cucumber scraps from the pickling industry, \u201cpulp left over from juicing,\u201d and was served on a \u201crepurposed bread bun.\u201d \u201cCow corn fries\u201d served as a side dish, made from field corn \u2012 different from sweet corn that people usually eat \u2012 that represents 99 percent of the corn grown in the US. It is used to feed cattle. \u201cBruised beet ketchup\u201d was the condiment. \n\nFor dessert, \u201ccocoa husk custard\u201d was made from the outer shell of a cocoa bean, the dried skin and the material leftover after pressing nuts for oil. \n\nKass dreamed up the themed lunch after he learned of the year-end UN climate negotiations in Paris, he told AFP. Those talks aim to create a far-reaching global agreement to tackle climate change. Yet the world leaders heading to those negotiations weren\u2019t talking about food waste, \u201cexcept in small environmental circles,\u201d he said. \n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Barber has tackled the food waste concept. Earlier this year he ran a pop-up restaurant in New York City that featured food scraps. \n\n\u201cThe idea of doing a \u2018waste dinner\u2019 would not have existed in the 1700s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe westernised conception of a plate of food is enormously wasteful because we\u2019ve been able to afford waste.\u201d \n\nHe hopes that the menu is enough to get the world leaders \u2012 including Ban and the meal\u2019s hosts, French President Francois Hollande and Peruvian President Ollanta Humala.\u2012 to spread the message of the dangers of food waste, gradually changing food culture. \n\n\u201cThe long-term goal of this would be not to [be able to] create a waste meal,\u201d Barber said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that by lecturing \u2012 you do it by hedonism, by making these world leaders have a delicious meal that will make them think about spreading that message.\u201d", "source": "Russia Today"}
