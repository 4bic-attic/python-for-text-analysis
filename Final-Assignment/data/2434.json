Source: AAP  \n        \n JUSTIN Bieber has thanked Australia for its warm welcome hours after jetting into Melbourne.  \n   \n\"LOVING Australia. I've missed this place. Thanks for the welcome,\" he tweeted on Sunday. \nA smiling Bieber landed in Melbourne at about 9am on Sunday. Dressed in a beige hoodie, grey trackie pants and red trainers, the Canadian heart-throb touched a handful of the 100 or so screaming fans waiting for him at Tullamarine airport before getting into a silver sedan and being chauffeured away. \"He was really good and smiling to us all,\" fan Tess Gia, 25, told AAP. \"I don't have tickets to see him while he's here so I was happy I saw him here - it was my best chance.\" Bieber is enjoying a rest day on Sunday before performing a rooftop radio gig in Melbourne for the Hit Network on Monday night. He will then fly to Sydney, where he will appear on the Seven Network's X Factor stage on Tuesday. After that, he will head to a secret location - dubbed \"Bieber Island\" - in Sydney harbour to perform at a concert presented by KIIS radio and iHeartRadio Australia. Fans can only see the show by winning tickets, which are now being scalped online for up to $700 each. The trip comes as Bieber celebrates his first Australian No.1 single; the track What Do You Mean? is topping the ARIA singles chart for the fourth consecutive week. His new album will be released on November 13.", "source": "Townsville Bulletin"}
