He expressed hope that the disgruntled Madhesi parties would come to the negotiating table to figure out a solution. \u201cViolence cannot and should not be a solution to the problem. Dialogue and talks will be of great help to resolve the issues,\u201d Sharma added. \n \nOn the demarcation of provinces, Sharma argued that the parties had not done injustice to the Madhesi people as their province encompasses districts from Parsa to Saptari. \u201cSome people in the plains might be unhappy, but nationalist people and parties will support the seven-province federal model,\u201d Sharma held. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nThe post appeared first on The Himalayan Times .", "source": "Himalayan Times"}
