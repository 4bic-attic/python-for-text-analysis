I used a light grey ink.\n\u00a0I have a sentiment stamp that I previously cut apart.\n\u00a0They easily line up right back together like they were originally intended to be used.\n\u00a0Here I left this picture in because I stamped crocked so I restarted but not by cutting another mat I just flipped over my card stock.\nThe card stock I am using is a heavy weight white card stock.\n\u00a0Added some tiny google eyes with some Tombow glue and a quick stick.\nThe spider is from a retired Stampin Up stamp set.\nI put the card mat on a base that matches my ink.
