In order to expand our leadership in cross-platform software and services, we are investing strategically - organically through new products and services based on the BES platform, and through acquisitions like AtHoc and Good.\" \n \n- BBRY CEO John Chen \n  \nBy Scott Tzu \n \nThat commentary doesn't sound like it's coming from the lips of a man who's confidence has been shaken. However, BlackBerry's (BBRY) report was no doubt a miss across the board. The headline numbers are ugly, and the stock has reflected this. \n \nThey missed on almost every single metric that analysts were guiding them on, including hardware, software, margin, earnings and revenue. Taking a first look at this report has shook out even more BlackBerry investors, as the stock moved lower immediately in pre-market trading to about $6.40. Heading into the company's conference call, the stock is now at about $6.80. \n \nLet's recap earnings. Here were some of the highlights pointed out in the company's press release, \n Non-GAAP software and services revenue of $74 million, a 19% increase over Q2 FY15 driven by 33% growth in software licensing revenue.   Positive free cash flow of $100 million in the quarter. Cash and investments balance of $3.35 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter, an increase of $37 million over Q1 FY16 after using $47 million on share", "source": "TeleTrader.com"}
