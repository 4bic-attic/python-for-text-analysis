You can trust me to\u00a0deliver a stronger economy and\u00a0a safer community. \n\n\"The Prime\u00a0Ministership of this country is\u00a0not a prize or a plaything to\u00a0be demanded. It should be\u00a0something which is earned by a\u00a0vote of the Australian people.\" \n\nHe demanded the destabilisation stop. \n\n\"I firmly believe that\u00a0our party is better than this,\u00a0that our Government is better\u00a0than this and, by God, that our\u00a0country is so much better than\u00a0this.\" \n\nIn a brutal critique of Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull declared he needed to move because Mr Abbott was incapable \"of providing\u00a0the economic leadership we need\" or \"the economic\u00a0confidence that business needs\". \n\n\"The big\u00a0economic changes that we're\u00a0living through here and around the world offer enormous\u00a0challenges and enormous\u00a0opportunities,\" he said. \n\n\"We need a style of leadership\u00a0that explains those challenges\u00a0and opportunities, explains the\u00a0challenges and how to seize the\u00a0opportunities. \n\n\"A style of\u00a0leadership that respects the\u00a0people's intelligence, that\u00a0explains these complex issues\u00a0and then sets out the course of\u00a0action we believe we should\u00a0take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans.\" \nTurnbull brutal \nMr Turnbull also attacked Mr Abbott's style of government, including\u00a0his notorious \"captain's\u00a0picks\" and the cabinet process. \n\n\"We have to\u00a0remember that we have a great\u00a0example of good Cabinet\u00a0government. John Howard's\u00a0government most of us served in\u00a0and yet few would say that the\u00a0Cabinet government of Mr Abbott\u00a0bears any similarity to the\u00a0style of Mr Howard,\" he said. \n\nMr Turnbull said it was his duty to protect Australia from Labor leader Bill Shorten becoming Prime Minister\u00a0 \n\n\"We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row,\" he said. \n\n\"If we continue\u00a0with Mr Abbott as Prime\u00a0Minister, it is clear enough\u00a0what will happen. He will\u00a0cease to be Prime Minister and\u00a0he'll be succeeded by Mr\u00a0Shorten\".\u00a0 \n\nMr Turnbull would not make changes to climate policy nor\u00a0bring forward a vote on same sex marriage. \n\nIn a sign of the rancour to come, a\u00a0bitter Mr\u00a0Hockey also pledged support for Mr Abbott, refused to stand down and slammed Mr Turnbull's critique that the government in its current form could not provide economic leadership. \n\n\"(Mr Turnbull)\u00a0has\u00a0never said to\u00a0me or to the\u00a0Cabinet that we are heading in\u00a0the wrong economic direction.\u00a0The disloyalty of some has been\u00a0outrageous.\" \n\n\"We must put the national interest ahead of any self-interest. The Prime Minister has my absolute loyalty as I have his.\" \n\nLabor has feared a transition to Mr Turnbull who is vastly more popular than Mr Abbott, especially among Labor voters. \n\nMr Shorten said a switch to Mr Turnbull \"changes nothing\" because Mr Turnbull had been part of a dysfunctional\u00a0government. \n\n\u00a0\"Australia has been\u00a0going\u00a0nowhere for the last two years,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\n\"Australia does not\u00a0need\u00a0another out of touch,\u00a0arrogant\u00a0Liberal leader.\" \nSudden move \nAfter days of intense speculation that another challenge was coming, Ms Bishop visited Mr Abbott at noon on Monday to tell him he had lost the support of the backbench and the cabinet. She told him he should stand aside. \n\nSources said the meeting was very brief and Mr Abbott\u00a0\"wasn't happy to say the least\". \n\nWhen Question Time finished at 3.10pm, Mr Turnbull followed the Prime Minister back to his office and, during a 20-minute meeting, told Mr Abbott\u00a0that\u00a0unless he stood aside, there\u00a0would challenge. Mr Turnbull resigned from the frontbench and more of his supporters were threatening to do the same unless Mr Abbott stepped aside.\u00a0 \n\nMr Turnbull was rolled by Mr Abbott as Opposition leader on December 1, 2009. \n\nMr Abbott is the fourth longest serving Liberal leader following Robert Menzies, John Howard and Malcolm Fraser. \n\nBut\u00a0but\u00a0if Mr Abbott loses\u00a0to Mr Turnbull, he would have served as Prime Minister for just two years, less than both Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, both of whom he vanquished. \n\nA transition to Mr Turnbull would not\u00a0guarantee peace. Ministers such as Senator Abetz, Mr Hockey, Mr Dutton and Mr Andrews would be most likely to be dumped and Mr Abbott would go to the backbench.\u00a0 \n\nNationals leader Warren Truss threatened to tear up the\u00a0Coalition\u00a0agreement and negotiate a new one of Mr Turnbull\u00a0because\u00a0leader. \n\nFormer Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett savaged Mr Turnbull.", "source": "Australian Financial Review"}
