A resolution on unfair barriers to US exports is urgently needed, particularly given the clear congressional mandate in the recent Agoa renewal legislation,\" deputy assistant US trade representative Trevor Kincaid said in a statement ahead of a meeting today (Monday) with South Africa\u2019s special envoy on Agoa issues, ambassador Faizel Ismail.", "source": "FTW Online"}
