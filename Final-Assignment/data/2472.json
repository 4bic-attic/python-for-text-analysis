Conclusion\nAll in all, I'd say day one was a big success. \u00a0I was rarely hungry and the shakes were actually pretty good. \u00a0I drank a ton of water that wasn't listed above. \u00a0Time to see how I sleep tonight :)\nYou should follow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook.\u00a0You can also subscribe via\u00a0RSS\u00a0or\u00a0email.\u00a0 Please support the blog by doing your Amazon.com purchases through\u00a0this link.
