Host the ultimate 'staygate' instead", "id": "336bd374-3daa-4b80-b342-a28baed5d036", "content": "(BPT) - With college football season upon us, there\u2019s no better way to enjoy time with family and friends than getting together to cheer on your favorite team. This year, with rising ticket, concession and travel costs, why not gather your friends and family together for a private \u201cstaygating\u201d party in your own living room? Here are five tips to hosting the ultimate staygate this fall to do game day right. \n  \n* Pick your game day early! Do you have a favorite rivalry game? Is there a certain Saturday that promises lots of good conference showdowns? Plan now and let your friends and family know you\u2019ll be hosting an all-day staygate so you can get a full house and an accurate headcount. Email invites make it easy to get an accurate headcount, especially if your staygating party is a larger affair. They are also more environmentally friendly, and best of all, free! \n \n* Impress your guests by watching the game on an amazing television \u2014 like the OLED 4K TV s from LG, which allow your fans to experience each moment with the best picture quality on the market. OLED technology delivers a breathtaking picture with perfect blacks and amazing color, even at wide viewing angles \u2014 so every seat in the house feels like the 50-yard line. \n \n* Create a stadium atmosphere to set the stage for game day. Easily set up a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-capable multi-room speaker system, like LG\u2019s Music Flow , to play a game day soundtrack featuring your team\u2019s fight song and popular in-game anthems to get your crowd pumped up before kickoff and keep them energized throughout the game. Just use your smartphone to stream your playlist from your favorite service via the Music Flow Player App to get the party started. By adding a Music Flow sound bar and surround system, it will enhance the viewing experience with enveloping game day sounds of bands and cheering crowds. \n \n* Serve a creative spread. Game day snacks can make or break the atmosphere of a staygate, so make certain your fans aren\u2019t calling foul on what you serve. Go online to order local favorites, from wings and pizza to sliders and nachos, to give your guests a taste of what it\u2019s like to be back on campus, or color-coordinate your spread to create a celebratory vibe. For inspiration, check out your favorite team sites or regional food blogs. \n \n* Stock up on game day essentials. Once your RSVP list is finalized, don\u2019t forget to stock up on festive game day favorites. Encourage your guests to dress for the occasion! Just because the team can\u2019t see you, doesn\u2019t mean your lucky socks are any less lucky. Break out those team colors, wear them with pride and challenge your fellow staygaters to do the same. Do you cheer on your team with shakers or foam fingers? Cowbells or clappers? Recreate that stadium electricity by offering your fans the same fun noisemakers at your staygate.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nFor more tips and advice on how to \u201cdo game day right\u201d from Official NCAA Corporate Partner LG Electronics USA, visit www.lg.com/us/do-game-day-right . \u00a0", "source": "Doaneline"}
