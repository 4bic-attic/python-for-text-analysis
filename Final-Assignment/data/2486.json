It may have been part of a plea bargain on charges related to the kidnapping of two early primary states. All we know is that Mr. American Voter agreed to go to anger management counseling, and the Democratic and Republican parties agreed to split the cost. \n\n\u201cMr. Voter,\u201d the counselor began cautiously, \u201cdo you know why you\u2019re here?\u201d \n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be somewhere,\u201d Mr. Voter snapped. \n\n\u201cYour friends in the Republican and Democratic parties care about you,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cThe party leaders think your anger has made your life unmanageable.\u201d \n  \nMr. Voter\u2019s answer was unprintable in a family newspaper. \n\nThe counselor picked up a small notepad and a pen from a side table. \u201cTell me, Mr. Voter, when did you first experience a feeling of strong anger?\u201d \n\n\u201cSeptember 11, 2001,\u201d Mr. Voter said. \u201cThings were going along all right. We had just had a long national debate over whether oral sex was adultery. It was football season, baseball playoffs were coming up. Things were all right. And then, somebody took a shot at us. Angry? I was volcanic. And I waited for the government to do something. Seemed like forever before they figured out what to do. \n  \n\u201cAnd what they did was a disaster. Fourteen years of war and it feels like the terrorists have won. Now we\u2019re helping Iran sponsor terrorism and get a nuclear bomb. And when I go to the airport, they throw out my shampoo. \n\n\u201cAngry? The government takes over the health insurance business and now it\u2019s costing me more, and my doctor retired at 55 years old. \n\n\u201cThe financial markets crash in 2008 and what does the government do? Bail out everybody who caused it. Meanwhile I\u2019m getting zero percent interest on my savings and it seems like the stock market is rigged with computer trading and inside information. \n  \n\u201cAnd everything\u2019s more expensive. Food, energy, insurance, housing, college. And what does the government say? \u2018There\u2019s no inflation!\u2019 \n\n\u201cAll the jobs that used to pay $60,000, $70,000 a year, so you could live, they\u2019re gone or out of the country now. And what does the government say? \u2018Job creation is strong!\u2019 Over 90 million people have left the workforce. What does the government say? \u2018They\u2019re not unemployed!\u2019 \n\n\u201cAnd on top of everything, we\u2019ve got an open border and millions of people who came into the country without legal authorization. What does the government say? \u2018It\u2019s all good!\u2019 \n \n\r\r \n  \n\u201cI\u2019m angry all down my left side and all down my right side,\u201d Mr. Voter said. \u201cI\u2019m angry that CEOs are getting obscene payouts approved by corporate boards they recruited themselves. I\u2019m angry that anybody who stands up for the interests of Americans is called a nativist or an isolationist or a wing nut. Where are you going?\u201d \n\n\u201cTo get a bigger notepad,\u201d the counselor said. \n\n\u201cAnd another thing,\u201d Mr. Voter raged. \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing that American history is some kind of criminal record. I want Andrew Jackson on the 20. I want Alexander Hamilton on the 10. I want William McKinley on the mountain. I want George Washington taught in elementary school.\u201d \n  \n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough for our first day,\u201d the counselor said. \n\n\u201cJust give me the bill, we\u2019re done,\u201d Mr. Voter growled. \n\n\u201cNo, sir!\u201d the counselor insisted. \u201cThe Democratic and Republican parties promised to pay for this.\u201d \n\nMr. Voter slammed his fist through the top of a coffee table. \u201cYou know they\u2019ve run up $19 trillion in debts, right?\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019ll write you a check. My kids have enough bills to pay.\u201d", "source": "Inland Valley Daily Bulletin"}
