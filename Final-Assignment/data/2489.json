With another deadline looming, health care has become an important issue to be addressed, especially for Puerto Ricans enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. by Andy Uhler Tuesday, September 8, 2015 - 05:00 Story Tuesday marks the latest deadline for cash-strapped Puerto Rico. The group put in charge of putting together a comprehensive plan to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s debt has been told to deliver the plan to the governor by today. But given Puerto Rico\u2019s inability to reach other deadlines, many experts say they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the deadline was pushed back again. But as nearly half\u00a0of the island\u2019s residents are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid, healthcare is\u00a0one item in the debt restructuring plan that might need more immediate action.\u00a0 Rafael Cox Alomar, a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia, says the Clinton administration abolished a tax\u00a0break that had, for years, brought investment to the island. Many\u00a0pharmaceutical\u00a0and medical supply businesses subsequently moved to the mainland. \u201cThey harp back to the Clinton years and the mismanagement and lack of commitment and strategy that administration showed in its dealings with Puerto Rico,\" he says. \"It\u2019s sad to say, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d People have steadily been leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland since the 1990s, and the island is on track to lose another half million people by 2050. Dr. David Lenihan, President and CEO of Ponce Health Sciences University, says Puerto Ricans who decide to stay may or may not have access to healthcare. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda screwed,\" he says. \"Because it\u2019s not like living on the mainland, where if you\u2019re on Medicare or Medicaid your doctor just bills the federal government.\u00a0We don\u2019t have that right. The government has said 'You\u2019re a territory so you don\u2019t have the right to do it.' So what happens is, the government gives a block grant down to PR and if you spend it all, you can\u2019t go get more money.\u201d That could leave patients without access to healthcare. Senators introduced legislation last month to eliminate that cap on the grant for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid. Professor Charles Venator Santiago, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut says, if adopted, it would treat the territory more like a state. \u201cThere would have to be local reforms in the island because the public healthcare system we have there is fairly corrupt,\" he says. \"There has to be a lot more accountability and it can be done. It can be done quickly if the federal government would move forward, but I don\u2019t see that impetus right now.\" There\u2019s no hard deadline for restructuring Puerto Rico\u2019s healthcare funding issues, but it\u2019s inseparable from its larger debt problem and demands a solution.\u00a0For one thing, if funding for Medicare and Medicaid runs out, the island\u2019s residents don\u2019t have the safety net of the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0 Featured in: Marketplace Morning Report for Tuesday, September 8, 2015 Share It!\nYou Might Also Like...
