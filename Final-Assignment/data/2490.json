(Photo: The Enquirer/Janelle Gelfand) \n\n\u201cIt is an exciting time of transformation at Music Hall, and SPMH is right in the middle of it,\u201d said Don Siekmann, outgoing president of the Society for the Preservation of Music Hall. \n\nWhile officials have been finalizing the big-ticket renovation of Music Hall, the hall\u2019s support group \u2013 SPMH \u2013 has continued to make improvements behind the scenes, raise money and conduct tours of the landmark building. \n\nThe society, founded by volunteers 27 years ago, held its annual meeting in Corbett Tower on Tuesday, a day after the Music Hall Revitalization Company announced a firm timeline and design team to lead extensive renovations. Members heard further details about the construction plans from Stephen Leeper, president and CEO of Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC), developer of the project. Among the revelations: The historic, now-hidden carriageways will be re-purposed as VIP and concession areas. \n\nSPMH\u2019s hand is evident everywhere you look in Music Hall \u2013 from cleaning the chandeliers to funding plumbing repairs. This past year, the society paid $15,000 to \u201cdeep clean\u201d the marble and slate lobby floor, which is original to the 1878 hall. \n\nDocent guides took a record 2,400 people on backstage tours. And this year, SPMH took ownership of the superb \u201cMighty Wurlitzer Organ,\u201d which formerly graced the long-gone Albee Theater. It was gifted to the group by the Ohio Valley Chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society. An anonymous donation of $1.4 million funded its installation in Music Hall\u2019s Ballroom, where organ concerts are presented to sell-out crowds. \n\nAlso on Tuesday, board member Kathleen Janson introduced a display of art-carved wooden panels from Music Hall\u2019s original Hook and Hastings organ. They are temporarily on exhibit in Corbett Tower. She has led the project to rescue and restore the panels \u2013 many which were lost in Music Hall\u2019s last renovation \u2013 and announced several privately-owned panels that have been donated to the effort. Their restoration is being funded by the Patricia Corbett Endowment Fund of SPMH. \n\nIt is the society\u2019s goal, she said, to display these rare pieces in Corbett Tower after Music Hall\u2019s renovation, shown as they would have been mounted on the organ screen. They are fine examples of Cincinnati\u2019s own art-carved movement. \n\nSPMH\u2019s new president, Peter E. Koenig, partner in Buechner Haffer Meyers & Koenig Co, LPA, said it is his aim to keep Music Hall in the public eye after it closes in June. \n\n\u201cI envision that while Music Hall is dark during up to18 months of construction, SPMH will continue to increase the visibility of this iconic landmark in the consciousness of our community,\u201d Koenig said. \u201cWe look forward to re-emerging with Music Hall\u2019s re-opening in the fall of 2017 with abundant tours to showcase what will be the best concert hall in America.\u201d \n\nTo join, or for information, visit spmhcincinnati.org. \n\nComposer Libby Larsen visits CCM \n\nGrammy Award-winning American composer Libby Larsen, the first woman to serve as a resident composer with a major orchestra, will return to the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music on Sept. 26 for a performance of her new work, \u201cThe Birth Project.\u201d \n\nA trio of faculty and alumni artists will perform the Cincinnati premiere in Robert J.
