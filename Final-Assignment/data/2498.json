Ferry Pool: There were three Spotted Redshanks, three Green Sandpipers, a Common Sandpiper, a Snipe and 24 Dunlin on the pool at high tide, along with half a dozen Lapwing, c30 Black-tailed Godwits and c80 Lapwing. There were also 25 Shoveler and over 100 Teal present - with the drakes starting to come out of eclipse plumage, plus eight Shelduck and around 400 Black-headed Gulls, with the the whole place looking very busy! (AH) Spotted Redshank (above), Snipe, Shoveler & Teal on the Ferry (AH) Chichester GPs: Ivy Lake area - No sign of the Black Tern this morning, and fairly quiet bar a large roaming flock of Long-tailed, Blue and Great Tits, plus 15 or more Chiffchaffs, two Cetti's Warblers\u00a0and six Goldcrests. (OM) Drayton pits were no better; apart from Coots, wildfowl numbers were surprisingly low with the only interest being 20 Gadwall and a single drake Wigeon still in partial eclipse (doubtless the same bird that summered in this exact area). Two Cetti's Warblers were present and a about a dozen Chiffchaffs were in the hedges, whilst a single Snipe put in an appearance, but these apart, the only other interest was up to four Jays collecting acorns and a family party of three green Woodpeckers (OM).\u00a0 Medmerry: Easton Lane to the Stilt Pool - The two Garganey were still present this morning, and there was a Green Sandpiper and six Gadwall on the pool, and a dozen yellow Wagtails were flying around nearby. Along the banks/path to the Stilt Pool there were up to four Whinchats, eight Wheatears, two Stonechats, a Lesser Whitethroat, a few Chiffchaffs and two Corn Buntings, along with 30+ Stock Doves, 100+ Linnets and Goldfinches and up to 500 Meadow Pipits. There was a continuous flow of hirundines - most of which were House Martins, though there were a fair few Swallows and 30+ Sand Martins among them.\u00a0Also a female/juvenile-type Marsh Harrier was over the sea. There was not much on view out on the reserve, bar a few Curlew and plenty of Teal, and the two Bar-headed Geese with the Canada Geese early on. The Pool itself was quiet, with just two juvenile Avocets and eight Dunlin being the only waders present. (AH/A&YF/RJS/PH) Whinchat (above), Wheatear, House Martin, Meadow Pipit & Stock Doves at Medmerry (AH) North Wall area: There were some 300 Wigeon in and around White's Creek this morning, whilst on the Breech Pool there were 70 Black-tailed Godwits, 2 Common Snipe and 1 Spotted Redshank.
