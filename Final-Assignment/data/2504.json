I just Saw the news and felt troubled. I\u2019ve been trying to make self-examination but I just cannot get over it. Probably I am narrow-minded. I must apologize to the producers And their team. I am\u2026 the worst example of going back on my promise. Because I always keep my promises. What is your reason? You are already prepared for the occasion, why do you suddenly decide not to show? Just say that I am narrow-minded. Though\u2026anyway... I think\u2026 what I do is to make a show that helps my boss make money, And to help the audience save money and effort. I do not make a show for awards or for the judges. So that\u2019s it. You are really the queen of variety shows. you speak right to the core. But if you don\u2019t go, the ceremony will feel cold. (Dee Hsu says if people don\u2019t show because of being criticized, it makes the showbiz circle loose. How do you see it?) Right\u2026 Yes. The showbiz circle is always loose. Showbiz.
