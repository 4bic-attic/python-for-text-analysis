The other was on a path beside the road. It was a challenge to find the divergent path and in the beginning one had to have faith that we were on the right trail. About half way through the walk we visited the Santa Maria la Virgin Blanc church which was built by the Knights Templar in the 12 century. We arrived in Carrion requiring a beer to quench our thirst. It was a pleasant day discovering the town of 2200 people. It was once 10,000 strong. We attended a beautiful concert at the church followed by mass. We received the Pilgrams Blessing which was moving. The nuns provided a star to help us find our way. Almost half way there!!!!!\nAdditional photos below\nPhotos: 8, Displayed: 8 COMING SOON HOUSE ADVERTISING ads_leader_blog_bottom", "source": "Travel Blog"}
