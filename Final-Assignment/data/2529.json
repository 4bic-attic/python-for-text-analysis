The union has said those workers will stage their own work-to-rule campaign until they get a new agreement. \n \nThe previous school year ended with the possibility of all major teachers' unions being on some form of strike this fall, but agreements were recently forged with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation and the Ontario's English Catholic Teachers Association. \n \nBut even as labour peace appears to be taking hold, tensions remain over a new sex-education curriculum being implemented this year, with some parents saying the lessons will force children to make sexual decisions before they are capable. \n \nSome parents have threatened to pull their kids from school over the curriculum, but Education Minister Liz Sandals has staunchly defended the program, saying it gives kids information that can help keep them safe and healthy.", "source": "CBC"}
