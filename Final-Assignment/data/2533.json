Conduct your personal assessments and pick the rifle scope which you like, not the one your dad or best friend prefers. They are not the ones that will be shooting over it. In years past, I allowed my buddy talk me into purchasing a lower priced Simmons scope over the more costly Bushnell Elite I wanted.Ultimately, that ended up being a very poor choice on my part as the scope I bought turned out to be very poor when compared to one I genuinely wanted. Don't make the same error. \n \nHere are a few of the hunting scope postings we identified for you personally created on the following search phrases 4 x 12 -40 . \n \nIn the event that your search returns too few returned results then be sure to increase your search terms to some degree. If you see an excess of returned results, then tweak your search words and perform the search again.                        \n Scope Mount Picatinny Rail for Mossberg 500 series 590 12 Gauge 1YF SALE \n$5.99 \nTime Remaining: 52m \nBuy It Now for only: $5.99 \n   \n Simmons44 Mag 4 12x44 Riflescope Truplex Reticle 1 4 MOA Black Finish 441124 \n$100.28 \nTime Remaining: 59m \nBuy It Now for only: $100.28 \n   \n Swarovski Large Rifle Scope Guard 44084 \n$65.18 \nTime Remaining: 1h 30m \nBuy It Now for only: $65.18 \n       \n ATN DGMNNVC Digital NV Monocular Color \n$175.54 \nTime Remaining: 1h 44m \nBuy It Now for only: $175.54 \n   \n Swarovski Z3 3 9x36 4A Riflescope 59033 \n$781.57 \nTime Remaining: 2h 4m \nBuy It Now for only: $781.57 \n   \n Viridian Green Lasers C5L PACK C12 C5L w TacLoc Holster Ruger SR9c \n$264.90 \nTime Remaining: 2h 22m \nBuy It Now for only: $264.90 \n       \n Bushnell Legacy Binoculars 10 22x50 Black 121225 \n$138.86 \nTime Remaining: 2h 36m \nBuy It Now for only: $138.86 \n   \n 20017 Sightron SII Series 3 9x42 Riflescope HHR Reticle 1 Tube 1 4 MOA Matte Bl \n$220.68 \nTime Remaining: 2h 37m \nBuy It Now for only: $220.68 \n   \n 849398 Weaver Classic Rimfire 3 9x32 Riflescope Dual X 1 Tube 1 4 MOA Adustable \n$279.25 \nTime Remaining: 2h 37m \nBuy It Now for only: $279.25 \n       \n NcStar SUS31250GV2 Euro Series Gen II 3 12x50mm Scope Cross Plex Red Green Illum \n$71.54 \nTime Remaining: 2h 38m \nBuy It Now for only: $71.54 \n   \n NcStar SUM31250GV2 Euro Series Gen II 3 12x50mm Scope Mil Dot Red Green IIIum \n$75.67 \nTime Remaining: 2h 38m \nBuy It Now for only: $75.67 \n   \n Burris 201916 Xtreme Tactical XTR Rifle Scope 30mm Tube 3 12x50mm Reticle Matte \n$869.05 \nTime Remaining: 2h 51m \nBuy It Now for only: $869.05", "source": "Rifle Scope Guide"}
