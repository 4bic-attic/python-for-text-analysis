That\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nAnderson residents Greg and Liza Pierce couldn\u2019t wait to get the party started, dancing to the Michael Jackson recording \u201cPYT,\u201d Kool and the Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebration\u201d and Beyonce\u2019s \u201cLove On Top\u201d between bands.\n\nThe Pierces, and Anderson residents Bea Brumback and her daughter Meranda Turner, said having the event on the day before Labor Day was a good idea.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here tomorrow,\u201d said Greg Pierce, who plans to cook out at home.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have plans for tomorrow. I know we do,\u201d Bea Brumback said.\n\nBrumback said she likes the many events the city offers, including the recent sesquicentennial events.\n\n\u201cI participate in all of them all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nLabor Day picnic\n\nThe Madison County Solidarity Labor Council\u2019s annual Labor Day picnic is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today at Beulah Park in Alexandria.\n\nFollow Rebecca R.
