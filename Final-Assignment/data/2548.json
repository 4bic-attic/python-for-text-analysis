Today we had off from school and work .... so it was a family day! Woo hoo!\nI had insomnia this morning, so I cycled before everyone got up. ;-) After breakfast daddy ran on the treadmill. Joshua drew and the girls had a dance party. I played with the twins. Jacob is getting better at walking. Jeremiah loves to clap his hands! Ha! ;-)\nWe made a quick trip to Target after lunch since we were out of milk and other little things. Once home, we all walked to the park. ;-) It was fun to get some fresh air! The twins loved the swings! You two were so cute and I took a video. Jeremiah, you kept tucking your feet inside the swing seat so you looked like you were sitting in an egg! Ha! Everyone got a shower or bath after we got home .... you all were 5 little sweaty kids. ;-)\nThis evening we watched part of a movie with an Illusionist .... Gigi and Grandpa Jim have it to us. You all liked the floating table and sawing a woman in half. Oh my!\nSleep tight little ones!\nI love you all so much!\n-Mommy", "source": "Letters To My Children"}
