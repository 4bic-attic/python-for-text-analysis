THE documents filed on Thursday state prosecutors would pursue the death penalty against Dylann Roof, 21, because more than two people were killed, and that others' lives were put at risk.\n\nProsecutors also said they intended to present evidence on Roof's mental state, adult and juvenile criminal record and other conduct, as well as his apparent lack of remorse for the killings.\n\nRoof faces state charges including nine murder counts in the June 17 slayings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nHe is expected in court again on those charges in October.\n\nHe also faces federal charges including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, some of which are also eligible for the death penalty in that system.\n\nUS Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said federal charges were necessary to adequately address a motive that prosecutors believe was unquestionably rooted in racial hate.\n\nSouth Carolina has no state hate crimes law.\n\nRoof is white and appeared in photos waving Confederate flags and burning or desecrating US flags.\n\nHe purportedly wrote online of fomenting racial violence, and federal authorities have said he used a personal manuscript in which he decried integration and used racial slurs to refer to blacks.", "source": "Northern Territory News"}
