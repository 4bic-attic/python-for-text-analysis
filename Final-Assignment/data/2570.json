However, through June of 1971, the beautiful Berlinetta had not yet proven itself as the dominant competition machine it would become. A prototype race version was built and promptly crashed at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, and only a middle field finish came much later in 1971. Nonetheless, North American Racing Team patriarch Luigi Chinetti Sr. \n\nAccordingly, Daytona 12467 was modified from a standard road car for N.A.R.T. and entered in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. This era is still considered the golden age of road racing, due to the colossal battle between Ferrari and Porsche, and their awe inspiring 5-liter World Sports car Championship machines. Out of the box, in the world's most grueling race, '12467' finished a stunning fifth position overall, behind only the much larger and more powerful WSC machines. It came in eight laps ahead of the GT cars that it would be classified against in the future. By the end of that summer, with the requisite 500 road cars completed for homologation, the first of three batches (eventually totaling 15) of official Ferrari factory-prepared Daytona Competiziones were at the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans. The racing world watched as a flank of Daytonas took fifth through ninth place overall, once again behind only WSC machines, and swept the GT class podium. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona represents the final front engine road-based racecar built under the gaze of Enzo Ferrari \n\n\"The N.A.R.T.
