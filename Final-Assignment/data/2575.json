In coming up with the report that was released in June 2013, FinMark Trust researchers first polled over 57 000 households in 500 areas and by extrapolating their findings to the broader population, the researchers estimated that there were 2,8 million MSME business owners in the country, running about 3,5-million businesses during the review period. \n \nMeanwhile, FBC says it has fully deployed its syndicated loan facility of US$60 million that was raised last year. \n \nA syndicated loan is offered by a group of lenders (a syndicate) who work together to provide funds for a single borrower. \n \nStandard Chartered Zimbabwe, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and Investec Asset Management Proprietary Limited acted as joint mandated lead arrangers in the three-year syndicated term loan facility for FBC. \n \nFBC, which is leveraging on its strong liquidity position to support business development initiatives, used part the funds to construct housing units in Greendale, Waterfalls (Masotsha Ndlovu Phase 3 and 4), Glaudina and Mbizo. \n \nIn the half year ended June 30, 2015, FBC reported that its net profit climbed 22 percent to US$8,2 million from the same period a year ago, while its total assets jumped 4 percent to US$498 million, spurred by significant growth in deposits and lines of credit. Total deposits also increased by 3 percent to US$375,4 million due to growth in credit lines. \n \nHowever, loans and advances slumped 1 percent to US$311,7 million on the back of \u201caggressive efforts implemented by the group towards collections.\u201d \n \nThe bank also plans to reduce non-performing loans to below 10 percent in the short to medium term. \n \nGovernment and private investors are increasingly focusing on SMEs as high growth zones. \n \nThe Small Medium Enterprises and Development Corporation (SMEDCO) is now under the supervision of the RBZ following the amendment to the Small and Medium Enterprises Act. \n \nIn addition, Proparco, a development finance institution that is partly owned by the French Development Agency, recently extended two facilities worth US$20 million in support of SMEs through NMB Bank and CABS in February and March 2014, respectively.", "source": "SundayMail.co.zw"}
