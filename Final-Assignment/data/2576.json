Why me? Why now? \n\n\u201cI needed to remain really positive, not only for me to be able to bounce back from such a serious injury like that but also for the team as well. I wanted to help out the guys who moved into my position, and sobbing around the team wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.\u201d \n\nUnlike Sisyphus, who was punished by the Greek gods for his deceitful and self-important ways, Carter is one of rugby\u2019s genuine nice guys. \n\nFor all the individual plaudits he receives, for all the endorsement deals that put his picture up on billboards around the world \u2014 often dressed in just underwear \u2014 he is at heart a dedicated team man. \n\n\u201cOne of his greatest qualities is that the team always comes first,\u201d New Zealand captain Richie McCaw told CNN. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been one of the best players in the world for a long time but it\u2019s still the All Blacks and the team performing that\u2019s more important than him. He\u2019s always just one of the boys who wants to see the team do well, which is a pretty special trait.\u201d \n\nAfter McCaw famously played with a broken foot to help New Zealand beat France in the 2011 final, Carter focused on rehab as he banished thoughts of ending his international career and signing with an overseas club \u2014 having already had a brief, lucrative stint with Perpignan during a six-month sabbatical which was predictably cut short by injury \u2014 this time a ruptured Achilles tendon. \n\nIn 2012, he was named IRB world player of the year for the second time, and in 2013 he became just the fifth New Zealander to play 100 Test matches \u2014 though he had to leave the field after less than half an hour of that milestone game against England at Twickenham. \n\nInjuries continue to haunt him. Carter broke his leg in last year\u2019s Super Rugby final, playing for the Crusaders franchise in the southern hemisphere competition. \n\nAnother setback in February sparked doubts he would feature at another World Cup, but a commanding performance in his final international on home soil against Australia last month sealed his place in the squad traveling to England. \n\n\u201cI really wanted to finish on a high and the fact that it was a do-or-die game playing for the Bledisloe Cup \u2014 which means so much to this team \u2014 was huge, there was a lot riding on that game,\u201d Carter says. \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after the final whistle when I had all this joy, and I just loved this feeling of standing out on Eden Park with my teammates feeling so happy, and then I realized this was going to be the last time that I get to experience this feeling in New Zealand. It was quite sad, I didn\u2019t want that feeling to end.\u201d \n\nRegularly listed among sport\u2019s sexiest athletes, Carter now has a young family to look after \u2014 in late 2011 he married his longtime girlfriend, former New Zealand hockey player Honor Dillon, and this year their second boy was born. \n\n\u201cI probably only see them about 50% of the year, which can be really challenging,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time you realize it\u2019s such a small window being a professional rugby player in terms of your lifetime, so you want to make the most of the opportunity and live each day like it\u2019s your last. When you do spend time with your family, you just make the most of it.\u201d \n\nAfter this World Cup, Carter will join French club Racing Metro, having agreed a three-year deal worth a reported $1.6 million each season that will make him rugby\u2019s highest-paid player. \n\nIt\u2019s a long way from his formative days in the tiny South Island town of Southbridge \u2014 population less than 800 \u2014 where he spent endless hours kicking a ball over goalposts his dad built for him in the family\u2019s front garden. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where it all started \u2014 that\u2019s probably the best birthday present I ever received,\u201d recalls Carter, who as a child was inspired by the New Zealand team that won the inaugural World Cup at home in 1987. \n\n\u201cIt was always a dream to play for the All Blacks but I never really thought it would happen, so I was out there just having fun, just throwing the ball around, kicking the ball around with my mates, by myself, with whoever I could find. I think that gave me the skill set and the base to be at the level I am playing at today.\u201d \n\nMcCaw, who first played with Carter in Canterbury\u2019s provincial team in 2002, said his friend has never lost that approach to training. \n\n\u201cI think people perhaps watch him on TV and think this is a great player, but they don\u2019t see how much hard work he puts in. He practices harder than anyone I know and he\u2019s always the last one to leave \u2014 extra kicking, extra things that make him the man he is,\u201d McCaw says. \n\n\u201cHe can do it all \u2014 ball in hand, he can tackle, he can kick, so as a fly-half he\u2019s got all the skills to be a threat wherever and he\u2019s a great man to have in your team.\u201d \n\nFor Carter it\u2019s all about being part of a team, on and off the field. \n\n\u201cRugby is something that builds friendships. I don\u2019t think I could compete in an individual sport,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cThe beauty of rugby is as soon as that final whistle has gone, your enemies are also your friends as well, and I love that camaraderie about the game. \n\n\u201cMy friendships, my best mates, are all because of rugby. Whether teammates or opponents, they are friends for life.\u201d \n\nCarter\u2019s role in the No. 10 jersey means he is the team\u2019s playmaker, directing tactics once the forward pack controls possession. \n\n\u201cMy role within the team has changed over the years. My first few years I was a young, pretty quiet guy,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cNow I am very vocal when I am out on the field, I am demanding of other players. I also have to be a good listener because the guys are often telling me what they are seeing, and I have to take that information in to make sure I\u2019m making the right decision. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my 13th year in the side so I\u2019m one of the older guys and so I need to be working really hard with the younger guys and get them up to speed, but be a real leader.\u201d \n\nCarter needed all his experience in the All Blacks\u2019 opening match of the 2015 World Cup, as New Zealand came from behind to beat Argentina 26-16 in front of a record rugby crowd of almost 90,000 at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium on Sunday. \n\nHe kicked 16 points to extend his record tally to 1,532 in his 107th international appearance, putting him 286 clear of nearest rival Jonny Wilkinson, whose final Test was in 2011. \n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s more about the bigger picture of doing whatever I can to help this team go all the way \u2014 I am just a small cog in this side,\u201d says Carter, who will sit out Thursday\u2019s second Pool C match against Namibia at London\u2019s Olympic Park as coach Steve Hansen makes 12 changes. \n\n\u201cTo be there at the end of the tournament and be lifting that Rugby World Cup up would be a dream come true. We are wanting to create history, do things that other teams have never done before and just have this mindset of being the most dominant team in the history of world rugby.\u201d \n\nIf Carter can finally land rugby\u2019s holy grail in the final on October 31, there will be few denying that he\u2019s earned it. The sporting gods, no doubt, are keeping a close eye on his progress.", "source": "949 KCMO"}
