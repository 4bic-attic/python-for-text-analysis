The $400,000 will be appropriated to Guam Visitor\u2019s Bureau from the fiscal year 2014 Hotel Occupancy Tax Surplus Fund. \n\n\n\r\nThe president of the Guam Football Association, Richard Lai, noted in his presentation that in order to participate and host these World Cup Qualifying games, a total of $1.2 million would be needed. FIFA provided seed money to Guam in the amount of $300,000, the Guam Visitors Bureau provided $300,000, and $200,000 came from selling TV broadcast rights. The $400,000 appropriation from the fiscal year 2014 Hotel Occupancy Tax Surplus Fund will round off the needed funding. \n\nLai also mentioned that if they can\u2019t get the needed funding to host and participate in the competition, the Matao would have to withdraw from the competition. As a result, the momentum of soccer on Guam that the team built from past qualifying matches would be lost. \n\n\n\r\nThe testimonies at the hearing brought together a well-rounded discussion from the public, and the return on the investment was one of the most important topics covered in the hearing. One return anticipated is the financial gain from the tremendous exposure of Guam. \n\n\n\r\nGFA Vice President Joe Cepeda spoke about the immediate return on investment that hosting and participating in these qualifying events would have.\u201cWith our participation, hosting and recent success in the FIFA 2018 World Cup and AFC Cup 2019 Preliminary Joint Qualification matches, Guam has received tremendous worldwide publicity. This publicity will enhance Guam as a sports tourism destination,\u201d Cepeda said. \n\n\n\r\n\u201cOur return on investment will be great and far-reaching, from developing the community, improving our society, and creating opportunities through sports tourism,\u201d he said. \n\nInformation was provided in a press release. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.guampdn.com/story/sports/2015/09/25/bill-help-matao-well-supported/7279119", "source": "Guam Pacific Daily News"}
