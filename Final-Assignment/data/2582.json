The problem is many garlic supplements leave you tasting garlic and smelling like you rolled in a bed of garlic cloves. This pure and potent garlic supplement from BRI nutrition is odorless, tasteless and has zero aftertaste. It makes me feel good knowing it is made in the USA with no fillers or artificial ingredients. The smaller than pea size soft gels are easy to swallow and don't leave me burping garlic the rest of the day. I get all of the cardiovascular benefits without having to worry about being stinky.\" \n\nAbout BRI Nutrition \n\nBRI Nutrition, based in California, is a manufacturer and distributor of a variety of health supplements such as\u00a0 Resveratrol, and Triphala .
