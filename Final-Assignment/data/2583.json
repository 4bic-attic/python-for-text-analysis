As they came close to the water, they were shot by two men. \n\nTwo YouTube films published in the Saudi daily 'Sabq' showed hundreds of birds flocked cheerfully on the swamp before they were shot and their carcasses were piled up in a truck. \n\nOne film showed the two Saudis boasted about killing the birds in large numbers and the paper quoted viewers as saying authorities must track down the two hunters and punish them. It noted that their car number appeared in the film. \n\nIt was not clear where in Saudi Arabia the incident took place and whether the swamp was made by the two hunters as a snare for the thirsty birds.", "source": "Emirates247"}
