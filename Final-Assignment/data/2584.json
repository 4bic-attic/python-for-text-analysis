He said their highest priority is to finish the project safely and at high standards. \n \n\r\n\tA new completion date will be announced by the end of the year. \n \n\r\n\tThe delay isn\u2019t expected to add any new traffic impacts. Zelle says the construction work on the Minnesota side on Highway 36 is finished, and the Highway 64 roadwork in Wisconsin is on schedule. \n \n\r See more project details here. \n   \r \r \r \nConstruction of the St. Croix Crossing project \n \nPhoto: St. Croix Crossing Project Team", "source": "KSTP"}
