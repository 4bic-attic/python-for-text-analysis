These crystals were structurally characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinements. The crystal shapes and sizes were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Their optical properties were analyzed by ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) absorption spectroscopy. XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement data indicated all crystals have spinel-type cubic structure. FE-SEM images revealed the crystals tend to increase in average size with the reduction in the degree of polarity of the solvent. Finally, \u03b2-Ag2MoO4 microcrystals exhibited a dependence of optical band gap energies (from 3.30 to 3.38 eV) with the intermediary energy levels.", "source": "RSC"}
