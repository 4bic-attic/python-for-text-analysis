In 2010 I blogged the Court of Appeal guidelines being : \n  Rape Band 1 (6 to 8 yrs) \u2013 offending at the lower end of the spectrum where there are no aggravating factors, no serious violence, no abduction, the victim is not very young or very old.  Rape Band 2 (7 to 13 yrs) \u2013 involves moderate violence, pre-meditation, a rape involving more than one offender, or an especially vulnerable victim  Rape Band 3 (12 to 18 yrs) \u2013 offending with serious additional violence, wit multiple (three or more) aggravating factors. For particularly cruel, callous or violent rapes.  Rape Band 4 (16 to 20 yrs) \u2013 for multiple offending over considerable periods of time, gang or pack rape.   \nThere was obvious serious violence that left her unconscious. \u00a0It would seem to me the case would be Rape Band 2 or 3, not Rape Band 1. \n \nOfficer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Nick Pritchard, said it was one of the worst cases he had investigated. \n \n\u201cThis was a sexual attack that involved extreme violence. It was one of the most violent sexual attacks I\u2019ve seen in my career,\u201d he said. \n \nSo eight years seems rather light. He did plead guilty which gets 10% to 33% knocked off. \u00a0But in theory he could be out of jail in under three years. \n \n\u00a0 \nTags: rape", "source": "Kiwiblog"}
