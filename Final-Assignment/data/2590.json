This rating, the highest possible from Morningstar, is based on a 3-year (vs. 1,528 funds) and 5-year (vs 1,325 funds) weighted-average of risk-adjusted total return in Morningstar's Large Growth Category. \n\nMorningstar rates mutual funds from 1 to 5 stars based on how well they've performed after adjusting for risk and accounting for sales charges, in comparison to similar funds. \n\n\u201cOur distinct approach to factor-based investing aims to deliver the best potential for sustainable long-term results for investors through well diversified, smartly constructed portfolios,\u201d said Gregg S. Fisher, Gerstein Fisher\u2019s Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager of Gerstein Fisher Funds. \u201cWe are proud of the integrity of our process and the resulting performance of not only GFMGX, but also our two other Multi-Factor\u00ae funds.\u201d \n\nThe Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor\u00ae Growth Equity strategy uses a quantitative investment model that provides diversified exposure to domestic growth-oriented companies.

(Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating\u2122 for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. \n\nGerstein Fisher Multi-Factor\u00ae International Growth Equity Fund (GFIGX) was rated against the following numbers of Foreign Large Growth Category funds as of August 31, 2015, over the following time periods: 300 funds in the last three years.
