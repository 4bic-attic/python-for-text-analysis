She had presented with severe incontinence. It was previously suggested to the inquiry by the former Master of the Rotunda Hospital Dr Peter McKenna that a vaginal hysterectomy would have in no way solved Ms Cruise\u2019s problems.\n\nMs Cruise was in attendance at the inquiry this morning.\n\nHelen Cruise \n\n\u201cNot ideal\u201d\n\nVan Geene said that it is not unheard of for him to not meet a patient such as Ms Cruise prior to her coming to the operating theatre.\n\nHe agreed that the situation Ms Cruise found herself in was \u201centirely not ideal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely I would have preferred to see her on the ward but with her having reached theatre I thought surgery was the best option,\u201d he said.\n\nBird countered that van Geene had performed a surgery designed to alleviate a prolapse, something that Ms Cruise didn\u2019t have.\n\nA prolapse is a slipping-down of a part or organ of the body.\n\nVan Geene replied that as far as he was concerned, she did indeed have a prolapse.\n\nVan Geene said it was \u201cquite impossible\u201d that he could have obtained Ms Cruise\u2019s consent to undergo surgery the first time he met her, which was while fully scrubbed up pre-surgery in the operating theatre.\n\nThe allegation that this consent was obtained after Ms Cruise had undergone a spinal anaesthetic and was lying on the surgical table is one of the key charges against van Geene with respect to Ms Cruise.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely incorrect that I discussed the consent with Ms Cruise in the theatre, it was done outside, I cannot be more categorical than that,\u201d he said.\n\nLong exchange\n\nThere followed a lengthy exchange where Ms Bird asked Dr van Geene extensively about his dealings with Ms Cruise following her second visit to theatre to have her post-operative bleeding stopped.\n\n\u201cThere were no complications during the surgery,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Bird contended that Dr van Geene had told Ms Cruise following the surgery that he had \u201cthrown her womb in a bucket\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cMs Cruise had a recollection of it and that it had been upsetting,\u201d replied Ms Bird.\n\n\u201cDid you say when meeting several members of her family after Ms Cruise\u2019s second trip to theatre: \u2018My God how many generations have we got here\u2019, did you say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say \u2018she\u2019s not out of the woods yet,\u2019 and walk off?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say \u2018your mother is a smoker, she coughed and put pressure on her organs\u2019? You removed one ovary, did you tell her family \u2018and I ripped the other one out too\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say: \u2018your mother didn\u2019t lose enough blood to become brain damaged\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say: \u2018well at least she won\u2019t get ovarian cancer\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI put it to you that you did use all these phrases?\u201d\n\nFault\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s suffered a bleed surely the operation is at fault?\u201d asked Ms Bird.\n\n\u201cDid you say: \u2018I already told your family what happened, why don\u2019t you ask them\u2019,\u201d asked Ms Bird.\n\n\u201cDid you say: \u2018you coughed and busted yourself open\u2019?\u201d asked Ms Bird.\n\n\u201cDid you say: \u2018sue me, sue me, sue me\u2019?\u201d asked Ms Bird.\n\n\u201cDid you say that you weren\u2019t getting paid to be there?\u201d asked Ms Bird.\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nOriginally published 11.18 am", "source": "TheJournal.ie"}
