Instantly felt smarter as soon as we walked into Harvard Yard, I\u2019m not going\u00a0to lie. \u00a0It was really a beautiful campus and\u00a0soooo very different from where I went to college. \u00a0Case in point - Harvard was established in 1636; UCF (my alma mater) was established in 1963. \u00a0Different worlds. \u00a0It was cool to see a campus with so much history and heritage. \u00a0And Cambridge itself is a cool little town, and home to the only Curious George shop in the world. \u00a0Fun fact there. \u00a0 I even picked up a little souvenir for Jillian... I have also taught her to say \u201cI\u2019m going to Harvard!\u201d whenever she wears the shirt. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t hurt to start that early. \u00a0Hee. After putzing around Cambridge for a little while, we made our way back to Boston with just enough time to get changed and take a bunch of shameless selfies in Red Sox gear. \u00a0Neither of us are Red Sox fans at all, but when in Boston... \u00a0(Go Cubs) Once we got that out of our systems, we walked over to\u00a0another T station to get the train to Fenway. \u00a0Two subway experiences in one day! \u00a0 Fenway was just as awesome as everyone says it is. \u00a0So big, so green, so much history. \u00a0 Our seats were really good but\u00a0in direct sunlight, so we literally just baked for the first three innings. In need of a reprieve from the sun, we went down under and walked around Fenway for a few innings and ate baseball stadium things like hot dogs and Cracker Jack. \u00a0 We went back up to our seats for a few more innings and got to sing Take Me Out to the Ballgame and Sweet Caroline and then made our way back to the T. \u00a0(They were winning like 6 to 2\u00a0when we left) We got back to downtown and wandered around Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall for a bit to pick up souvenirs before returning to our hotel for showers. \u00a0Our plan was to\u00a0have a nice dinner on the North End for our last night. \u00a0And that\u2019s exactly what we did. \u00a0Even got a little dressed up for the occasion. On Saturday we had scoped out where we wanted to eat and decided on a place called Cafe Florentine on Hanover. \u00a0Many of the restaurants on the North End were tiny and had lines wrapped around the block. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry but if a restaurant has a line wrapped around the block, it is not a restaurant I want to go to. \u00a0Who want to wait that long to eat? \u00a0Luckily Cafe Florentine was pretty easy to get into. \u00a0We only had to wait for them to clear off a two top before we sat down. The food was really really good. \u00a0I had gnocchi and Hubs had spinach lasagna accompanied by the most amazing bread and wine. \u00a0It was all very very good. \u00a0And then of course afterwards we had to make a pastry run. \u00a0Because that\u2019s what you do in Boston. \u00a0Since we had been to Mike\u2019s the day before we decided to try Modern. This was the line outside of Modern. \u00a0I won\u2019t wait in a restaurant line that\u2019s wrapped around the block, but I will wait in line for pastries for that long. \u00a0Twice. Yes, after we got our pastries from Modern, we went over to Mike\u2019s and stood in line there and got more\u00a0pastries. \u00a0Because we\u2019re gluttons. \u00a0Hey, when in Boston... \u00a0 Yes, that is Hubs skipping down the street with his pastry boxes. \u00a0 Thankfully our mileage tally for the day was over 10 miles, so that helped a bit. And that was our last evening in Boston. The rest of the evening was spent packing and resting. \u00a0In the\u00a0morning we had to get up and drive back to Hartford to catch our flight home. \u00a0 All in all, GREAT vacation! \u00a0I loved every minute in Boston and\u00a0cannot wait to go back! How about you ... Who is your favorite baseball team? \u00a0", "source": "Half Healthy, Half Nuts"}
