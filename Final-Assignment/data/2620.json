We shouldn\u2019t have conceded the 1-2 directly after the 1-1. \n\n\"Then we lost our shape completely. Bayern made use of the decisive situations and went in pursuit of more. Based on the quality they possess, we have to accept this drubbing, although we were good in the first half.\" \n\n  \nPosted: 2015-09-23 12", "source": "Football365.co.za"}
