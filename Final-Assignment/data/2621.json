The Top 46,000 teams win cash with $100,000 paid to first place. Join now!\n\nIn addition to the daily stuff we have going on at FanDuel, we have also started an Eliminator and Pick'em league over at ESPN. \u00a0You can sign up for Eliminator\u00a0here and Pick'em\u00a0here. \u00a0Pick'em is pretty simple- you pick which team you think will win each game each week.\n\nEliminator is really fun. \u00a0You pick one team each week that you think is going to win. \u00a0If that team wins you move on to the next week. \u00a0If they lose you are eliminated. \u00a0What makes it even more interesting is that once you pick a team you cannot pick them again for the rest of the season.\n\nWe are a little bit late getting this started. \u00a0You need to be in before the Steelers and Patriots game kicks off tonight. \u00a0We will come up with something cool to do for the winner of both leagues.", "source": "Music City Miracles -  All Posts"}
