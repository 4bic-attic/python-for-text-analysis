Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nTreasurer Joe Hockey's crackdown on 1000 large companies accused of not paying enough tax in Australia is \"bad tax law' and will result in revenue wars with other nations, experts\u00a0have warned. \n\nOn Wednesday Mr Hockey introduced new legislation to Parliament that boosts anti-avoidance laws and\u00a0could see companies with annual global revenue of $1 billion or more hit with\u00a0double tax, plus interest, if they are found to be illegally shifting profits offshore. \n\nThe laws, which apply from January,\u00a0were initially expected to apply to 30 companies with with annual global revenue of $1 billion or more, but\u00a0will now affect 1000 companies. This is because the $1 billion figure applies to global revenue, and a company's local subsidiary, could have a revenue figure below that amount. \n\nMr Hockey\u00a0has refused to put an exact figure on the tax revenue expected to be recouped.\u00a0 \n \nTax Commissioner Chris Jordan, who joined Mr Hockey at a press conference\u00a0on Wednesday where they announced the new laws, said he hoped that multinationals would come forward and co-operate with the Australian Taxation Office, before the January start date. \n\nThe government could collect\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, simply\u00a0by using the new legislation as a threat, and encouraging companies to restructure\u00a0and pay more tax\u00a0ahead of the laws. \n\nBut tax experts are warning that the laws could deter business investment and spark revenue wars with overseas\u00a0tax authorities. \n\n\"This is a dangerous strategy for Australia to pursue,\"\u00a0Tax Institute President Stephen Healey said. \n\n\"The bill that has been introduced to Parliament today [on Wednesday] includes provisions in relation to country-by-country reporting that have been hastily drafted, with inadequate consultation, before global efforts directly relevant to these matters are finalised. \n\n\"The result is further uncertainty, complexity and, if passed, potentially bad tax law.\" \n\nAlready, one of the US Treasury's top officials, has labelled the Australian\u00a0measures as evidence the debate is\u00a0heading\u00a0\"in a disturbing direction\" . \n\nUS deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs at US\u00a0Treasury, Robert Stack, has singled out Australia and Britain for unilaterally moving ahead of other countries, and\u00a0criticised\u00a0both governments for\u00a0putting politics\u00a0ahead of good policy. \n\nCPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley also expressed\u00a0concerns with the legislation, saying it had gone beyond capturing\u00a0only the so-called Dirty Thirty, \n\n\"Treasurer Hockey is now expanding the net to 1000 companies, which is potentially a lot of uncertainty, which will need detailed and considered explanation to ensure compliance,\" he said. \n\nMr Malley said Australia needed to work within the\u00a0OECD and the G20 crackdown against multinational\u00a0tax avoidance, known as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. \n\n\"This is important to ensure we can plug into the international grid and don't have our own unique system that is out of kilter with what may ultimately be the accepted multilateral approach,\" he said. \n\nChartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand tax leader\u00a0Michael Croker said the government needed to come up with a clearer formula about how profits are going to be taxed. \n\n\"The legislation being introduced into Parliament\u00a0may need to be more explicit about where the profits are being taxed,\" Mr Croker\u00a0said. \"It\u00a0doesn't talk about the extent to which the multinational\u00a0company has paid tax elsewhere ... and there\u00a0could be disputes between countries as a result.\" \n\nPitcher Partners tax partner Leon Mok said\u00a0he was worried mid-market companies\u00a0could be impacted. \"Given the implications of non-compliance are very harsh, the government needs to clarify what concessions and carve outs will be given for mid-market businesses with global parents,\" he said. \n\nTax Justice Network spokesman Mark Zirnsak\u200b welcomed the laws, but said\u00a0the government should be prepared to\u00a0take further action should companies simply develop new tax dodging techniques. \n\n\"This would include if they reduce their profits in Australia by artificially loading up their subsidiary here with things like inflated intellectual property charges,\" Mr Zirnsak\u00a0said. \n\n\"We also think the net of companies caught by the legislation should have been widened to include those with global revenues of over $250 million.\" \n\nKPMG tax partner Grant Wardell-Johnson said\u00a0although the wording of the bill was\u00a0simpler,\u00a0more taxpayers would\u00a0have to\u00a0work out whether they would\u00a0be hit.\u00a0\"How the ATO applies these provisions will be critical and early guidance will be important,\" he said. \n\nPwC international tax services partner\u00a0Peter Collins\u200b said Australia was taking\u00a0unilateral action ahead of its OECD counterparts, but it would be better to\u00a0gain international\u00a0consensus.\u00a0", "source": "Brisbane Times"}
