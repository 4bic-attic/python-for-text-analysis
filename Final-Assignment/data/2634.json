A single unit will process garbage from three to four nearby villages. Civic officials said it will ease the pressure on garbage management. \n\nAn administrative official said local waste processing units in the fringes are essential with a sharp rise in construction, population and commercial activities. The district planning and development council (DPDC) will provide some funds for the installation of the processing units. Pune Zilla Parishad has floated tenders for a detailed project report. \n\nAt present, villages in the fringes dump solid waste as they neither have a garbage management plan nor a processing unit. Once the processing units start functioning they would ensure that this garbage does not go to Uruli-Phursungi depot or is dumped in any open area. \n\nA senior official said since each processing unit will require 1.5 acre of land, vacant plots are being identified and there has been no opposition, so far. The units will also give additional income to the gram panchayats, he added. \n\n\"Each processing unit will process 25 tonne waste. Two separate plants to process wet and dry garbage may be set up. Options are being worked out for two units to produce CNG by processing garbage,\" official said.", "source": "Times of India"}
