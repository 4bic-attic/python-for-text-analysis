Whether it\u2019s actually gambling \u2014 a friendly bet on the big game, the weekly lottery ticket, those trips to the casinos \u2014 or taking a risk in life, we all want to be seen as that bold adventurer. \n\nClich\u00e9s abound. \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous \u201cYou\u2019ll always miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\u201d \u2014 Wayne Gretzke \u201cOnly those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.\u201d \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy \n \nOf course, there are just as many sayings warning against gambling: \u201cA fool and his money are soon parted.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous \u201cGambling: The sure way of getting nothing for something.\u201d Wilson Mizner \u201c And my favorite: \u201cHorse sense is a good judgment, which keeps horses from betting on people.\u201d \n\nIn my younger days, one of my favorite pastimes was a road trip to Vegas. I fancied myself a bit of a Blackjack expert, even though I seldom won big. Okay, I usually lost. But I set myself a limit and quit when I lost that amount. Most of the time. \n\nI still go to Vegas, but now it\u2019s for business or to take in the spectacle. The blackjack tables have gotten too pricey for me, and I do like to pretend that there is some skill involved in games I play, so slots hold no fascination. \n\nI admit to watching big money poker on television a time or two (when there wasn\u2019t baseball, football, basketball, soccer, golf, tennis, etc. on ESPN), and now I have a bit of affinity for Texas Hold \u2018Em. That\u2019s the poker game of choice for poker tournaments. \n\nNow if you go to fundraisers, you know that one of the more popular attractions is a \u201ccasino\u201d where you gamble play money to win play money, with the charity getting the real money. It\u2019s a more active pastime than listening to speakers drone on, and it adds to the charity\u2019s bottom line. \n\nSome of the more ambitious groups have tried to capitalize on poker\u2019s popularity, and added a poker tournament to the mix. The leader in that regard is Rancho Los Alamitos, where a Texas Hold \u2018Em tournament has been part of the Ranch Roundup fundraiser since day one. \n\nAnd yes, I have been sucked into that vortex. I have played every year. \n\nIt started out as a charitable thing. I plunked down my money, took my cards, and after only a few hands got up and walked away empty-handed. \n\nBut then there were a few players who, shall we say, enjoyed winning just a bit too much. The gleeful grin as I pushed my last few chips to the center of the table was more than I could handle. \n \nSo I studied up and got serious. The last two years, I\u2019ve made it to the final table. Last year, I finished fourth \u2014 just out of the money. \n\nIronically \u2014 or not \u2014 last year\u2019s winner wore that same gleeful grin as he flipped over his aces to beat my lowly threes. So you can bet I\u2019ll be back at the table this Saturday night, hoping Lady Luck will be just a bit kinder to me. \n\nWhat does all this have to do with you? Well, you too can do some semi-serious gambling while supporting Rancho Los Alamitos. You don\u2019t even have to decide to play until you get to the Rancho on Saturday evening \u2014 there will be day-of signups until 6 p.m. \n\nThere will be plenty of other activities as well \u2014 auctions, a barbecue dinner, other casino games, western music and line dancing \u2014 but we both know the real attraction. Beating the guy with the gleeful grin. \n\nGo to www.rancholosalamitos.com for details and come on out. I bet you can\u2019t beat me.", "source": "Gazettes Newspaper"}
