He was frustrated with what he calls a \u201cstagnation of ideas\u201d in the political class. \n\nHe lost that race, and in 2009, was selling cars when he got involved with the tea party movement. Since no one else was stepping up to collect data and organize, Rhodes took action and founded the Iowa Tea Party. \n\n\u201cWe started to organize groups, and trying to help set up groups, do trainings, harvest people, and connect them around the state,\u201d Rhodes said. \n\nThe relative political newcomer held rallies and events, did a bus tour, and trained Iowans on how to caucus. Rhodes\u2019 experience with the tea party helped him predict the anti-establishment wave of the 2016 election. \n\n\u201cThe one thing I noticed more and more on the ground was that people stopped listening to some of the same endorsers,\u201d he said. \u201cTo a much larger extent in this cycle, it\u2019s less about the power brokers than it was before.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s the neurosurgeon and political outsider\u2019s candidacy, coupled with Rhodes\u2019 unusual background, that has injected creativity into an Iowa campaign scene filled with cattle call forums and town halls at the local Pizza Ranch. Just after the first Republican debate in early August, Carson held a dinner fundraiser on a train in Boone, which raised $30,000. \n\nRhodes became an overnight tea party sensation during the 2011 campaign season for confronting President Barack Obama at a rural economic forum in Decorah. At the town hall-style stop, Rhodes asked the President about a reported remark by Vice President Joe Biden comparing tea partiers to terrorists. \n\n\u201cI said, hold on a second, I\u2019ve got a question. How can you demand civility if your vice president is calling tea party members like myself terrorists?\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cNext thing I know, I have every news truck from Fox and CNN parked in my driveway asking to talk about it. It was one more thing that raised the size of the platform.\u201d \n\nFast-forward a few years and a few business ventures later, and five prospective presidential candidates came calling, including Carson. \n\nRhodes initially wrote Carson off until hearing him speak at the Polk County Republicans Summer Sizzle in the summer of 2014. He was surprised that Carson filled the room with many people he hadn\u2019t already seen before. \n\n\u201cI saw somebody who could actually lead and bring people together that weren\u2019t the normal political people \u2026 When you see a phenomenon like that, you can either decide you want to check it out and dismiss it or go, \u2018Wait this is something you can build off of.'\u201d \n\nEventually, Rhodes got on board with Carson, a decision he was told he\u2019d regret by other Iowa GOP operatives. \n\n\u201cI narrowed it down to somebody that I could believe in on principle, and my heart went with Ben, that\u2019s just what it was \u2026 They asked, \u2018Why would you choose somebody who\u2019s never going to be up there, not going to even be in contention, you just don\u2019t get this process and you had the chance to be with other people.\u2019 \u2026 Originally I didn\u2019t have a great answer, other than I said, \u2018I see something you don\u2019t see.'\u201d \n\nThe Carson operation in Iowa is small. Rhodes has a staff of three, with two additional members coming on board this month. The team he\u2019s assembled is young, but what they lack in experience, they make up for with enthusiasm for Carson and his message. \n\nAlso bolstering Carson\u2019s grassroots efforts: his super PAC, the 2016 Committee. It is on a mission to deliver books to every caucus-goer, Midwest regional director Tina Goff said while handing out books, bumper stickers, and pins on Carson\u2019s behalf at the Iowa Faith & Freedom forum. The super PAC, which cannot coordinate with the campaign, makes about 40,000 phone calls per month with a staff of about 32 in the Midwest over the summer. And it has about a dozen well-placed billboards across the Des Moines metro area, and attend county meetings and festivals across Iowa. \n\nGoff began assembling her team in April 2014, first focusing on building Carson\u2019s name recognition in the Midwest. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a different cycle this time,\u201d Goff explained. In the 2016 race, super PACs are able to organize and mobilize voters independently of the campaign. \n\nCraig Robinson, a Republican activist and founder of TheIowaRepublican.com, said it\u2019s possible that the super PAC can build an effective grassroots operation. \n\n\u201cThey have been in existence for quite a while, long before Carson even started showing up in the state. That longevity gives them an advantage, because for a long time, it was people\u2019s only way to contact anyone in the Carson orbit, so people are used to dealing with them,\u201d Robinson said. \n\n\u201cI think the big problem is that campaign is going to be in the dark about what the PAC is doing. For example, does the PAC have someone lined up to speak at my caucus or does the campaign? What if there are two people who think they are going to do it, or worse, nobody? Caucus campaigns require a lot of attention to detail, so extra hands in the kitchen on caucus night could make things messy in a hurry,\u201d he added. \n\nOn the campaign side, Rhodes learned how to organize during his statehouse run, and the same principles apply to his operation. One tactic that\u2019s worked particularly well: asking others to help. \n\n\u201cYou can catch the wave, but if you don\u2019t capitalize off the wave, then it doesn\u2019t do you a whole lot of good. And that\u2019s kind of the thing in Iowa: if you can get those people to do something, whether it\u2019s walk in a parade, whether it\u2019s pick up a phone, whether it\u2019s give three or five dollars, they have some sort of investment in the campaign \u2026 The number one thing is getting people involved that love Ben that know him. They\u2019ve read his books. When you find somebody like that \u2014 when you find the kid he operated on, the father, saved his son\u2019s life or something like that, you really have to give those people something to do because they\u2019re your evangelists,\u201d Rhodes said. \n\nIt\u2019s a textbook behavioral economics concept: if you want someone to support you, ask them for help. They\u2019ll feel more connected and, in turn, more invested in your success. \n\nRhodes said his team has built a \u201cmassive volunteer network.\u201d They have chairs or co-chairs in all 99 Iowa counties, and is well on its way to organizing at the precinct level, with about 800 of 1,682 precinct chairs. \n\nAnd that kind of engagement is building a grassroots apparatus: \u201cIt can turn a staff of a few people into something that\u2019s a much larger machine of somebody who may have a staff of 10 or 12,\u201d he said. \n\nIn a Monmouth University poll released Aug. 31, Carson was tied with Donald Trump in Iowa, becoming the only candidate so far to pose a major threat to billionaire mogul in what pundits have dubbed the \u201csummer of discontent.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s the neurosurgeon and political outsider\u2019s candidacy, coupled with Rhodes\u2019 unusual background, that has injected creativity into an Iowa campaign scene filled with cattle call forums and town halls at the local Pizza Ranch. Just after the first Republican debate in early August, Carson held a dinner fundraiser on a train in Boone, which raised $30,000. \n\nThat same weekend, the campaign held three family festivals across the state in Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, and on a bridge in downtown Des Moines. It had food vendors, live music, and face painters, princesses, and ponies for the kids. Carson spoke at each event, took questions, and posed for photos with attendees. \n\n\u201cIt set the groundwork for him to take off,\u201d Rhodes said. The three events, Rhodes said, turned out around 5000 people, and created a buzz. \n\n\u201cWhen you can get out in front of that many people in Iowa and people love you and are excited about it, that\u2019s a lot of evangelists to go send out. All they got to do is tell a friend, tell a friend, and tell a friend,\u201d he said. \n\nThat grassroots, word-of-mouth campaign networking is crucial to building an organization in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. \n\nAnother new tactic: the campaign is driving a Carson logo-wrapped bus to different churches across the state and holding tailgates after Sunday services. Staffers chat about Carson with churchgoers, handing out books, bumper stickers, hot dogs, chips, and drinks in church parking lots. This strategy is key for Carson, who is looking to shore up the evangelical vote in a crowded field. \n\nCarson Iowa volunteer director Megan Assman said the campaign\u2019s innovative strategy reflects their unique candidate, who has never held public office. \n\n\u201cDr. Carson\u2019s not a politician. We\u2019re not going to do things on a campaign that normal campaigns would \u2026 I don\u2019t know of a lot of campaigns that are going to church with people and then afterward just chilling and grilling hot dogs and just getting to talk to people afterwards \u2026 This isn\u2019t a politician, so we\u2019re not going to run his campaign like that,\u201d she said. \n\nOne challenge for the Carson campaign is that about half of the Iowans committed to Carson are first-time caucus-goers. Staffers are tasked with making sure they know how to caucus, making sure they have a plan and a strategy to get them out on caucus night on Feb. 1. \n\nAssman said Carson\u2019s message is getting those new to the caucus process excited and committed. \n\n\u201cI thought it was going to be very hard. Just about every other person that I talk to has never caucused before. So in my job, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to walk them through this,\u201d Assman said. \u201cMy job should be a lot harder, but with him, people will do whatever it takes to get this man elected.\u201d \n\nUltimately, the goal is to get Carson in front of as many Iowans as possible before caucus night. \n\n\u201cIf they listen to Ben, they\u2019ll vote for him, or they\u2019ll at least think about voting for him,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of doing the work to put him in the position to win.\u201d", "source": "WXOK-AM"}
