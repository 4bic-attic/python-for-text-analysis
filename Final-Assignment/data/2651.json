Actually, it\u2019s a re-enactment, but that really is McKinley. A claim can be made that this is the earliest film of a U.S. president, but technically he wasn\u2019t president yet.\n\nMcKinley and his secretary walk from the front porch (where Ida McKinley, his wife can be seen in a rocking chair) toward the camera. McKinley looks at a (prop) piece of paper, dons a top hat, and they keep walking.", "source": "Retro Campaigns"}
