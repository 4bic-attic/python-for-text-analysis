The warrant was received by a certain Ruben Lurot. \n \nThe NBI team confiscated sales invoices, membership registration forms, official receipts, ledgers, journals, and all other books of accounts and documents used in recording investments. \n \nThe team also confiscated money collected for the purported investment activities, flyers and other advertising manuals, as well as projector or visual aid, laptop, desktop computers and security cameras being used by the company. \n \nMembers of Klikmart Rewards said they have no idea that the company is conducting illegal operations because they immediately got returns on their investments, placed at a minimum of P1,500 and have started to receive P15,000 twice a month. \n \nSection 8 of the Securities Regulation Code states that \u201cSecurities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the Commission.
