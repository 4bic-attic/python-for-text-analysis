Serious, sometimes life-threatening, 5-FU toxicity has occurred in an estimated 10-20% of patients treated with 5-FU. Administration of uridine triacetate can reduce the ability of toxic 5-FU metabolites to incorporate into the genetic material of healthy cells, enabling cellular recovery after overexposure to 5-FU and preventing cell death. \n \nRELATED: First Drug for Hereditary Orotic Aciduria Approved \n \nIn 2009, the FDA granted uridine triacetate Orphan Drug status as an antidote for 5-FU poisoning. Under an expanded access protocol and under FDA emergency treatment provisions, uridine triacetate is currently provided to patients at risk of excess 5-FU toxicity due to overdose and patients exhibiting serious toxicities to 5-FU within 96 hours of 5-FU administration. \n \nFor more information call (240) 631\u20132500 or visit WellstatTherapeutics.com .", "source": "Monthly Prescribing Reference"}
