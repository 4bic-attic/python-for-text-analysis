Besides the pulmonary and carcinogenic effects of air pollution, exposition to air pollution has been associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular mortality.\"\n\"In addition to the long term consequences, more recent research suggests that acute exposure to air pollution may trigger some cardiovascular events such as strokes, heart failure or myocardial infarction (heart attack),\" continued Dr Argacha. \"Myocardial infarction covers a number of clinical conditions and the effect of pollution on these subsets is unknown.\"\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022", "source": "A Closer Look"}
