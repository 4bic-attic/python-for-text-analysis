His remarks were read by a state TV anchorman. \n\nKhamenei says some U.S. officials have spoken of the \"suspension\" of the sanctions, which he says is unacceptable. He says Iran will only partially comply with its commitments if the sanctions are merely suspended. \n\nU.S. President Barack Obama recently secured enough support to prevent the Republican-led Congress from blocking the deal. The agreement would curb Iran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.", "source": "Charlotte Observer"}
