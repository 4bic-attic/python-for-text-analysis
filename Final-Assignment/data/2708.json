Boney \nSpecial to the NNPA from the Houston Forward Times \n \n\u201c\u2026The justice that we seek will not come from these courts, it will come from us.\u201d \u2013 Marian Tolan \n \nThe fight for justice has come to a close for police brutality victim and former baseball star Robbie Tolan \u2013 at least in the courtroom. \n \nEarly Tuesday morning, attorneys for both Robbie and Bellaire police officer Jeffrey Cotton announced that a settlement had been reached between the two parties in the civil trial that was scheduled to begin that day. \n \nAccording to the settlement, the City of Bellaire will only pay $110,000 to settle the civil rights suit filed by Robbie Tolan. In addition to that, the settlement allows Robbie to discuss the details of his experience with impunity. \n \n\u201cLet me be clear about this, this is a win ONLY in the sense that I will not allow anyone else to write the end of my story,\u201d said Robbie. \u201cI will define my legacy. I will tell my story. No one will tell it for me! God has given me peace! I thank God for my parents, my extended family and friends, my awesome attorneys who were ready for battle, and all of my supporters. We are relieved to put this behind us and move on!\u201d \n \nThe journey towards this settlement has been full of many challenges and roadblocks along the way for Robbie and his family. \n \n\u201cGod understands the direction we\u2019re having to go and He understands that this has been a long and lonely journey that\u2019s lasted 7 years. I\u2019m taking the end of my story out of the judge\u2019s hands,\u201d said Robbie. \u201cMy foundation, my book, and the lives of young men and women of color who have suffered injustices will be my focus. I\u2019m ready to write the next chapter.\u201d \n \nRobbie was shot on New Year\u2019s Eve in his driveway in 2008 by Cotton, after he and Officer John Edwards mistakenly identified Robbie\u2019s vehicle as having been stolen. Robbie\u2019s vehicle was found to have not been stolen, nor was either man found to have been armed. More importantly, the license plate number that the officers entered into their computer was the wrong one, leading them to identify the wrong suspects. A grand jury indicted and acquitted Cotton, after only charging him with aggravated assault, which is what led the Tolan family to file the civil lawsuit, which eventually ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court because of the decisions by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to grant qualified immunity to the officers. The U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the civil lawsuit filed by Robbie, with a unanimous decision back in May 2014. \n \nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court said that the courts must review excessive force claims in \u201cthe light most favorable to the party asserting the injury\u201d and determine whether the right in question was \u201cclearly established at the time of the violation.\u201d In addition to that, the Supreme Court justices declared that they reached the \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d that the Fifth Circuit of Appeals made a gross error by giving more credence to the narrative presented by Cotton and his attorney\u2019s and by not delving deeper to properly investigate contradictory evidence. \n \nOnce the case landed back in the hands of Judge Harmon, things appeared to get even more challenging for Robbie and his high-powered legal team. \n \nOn Sunday, Robbie and his attorneys called for Judge Harmon to recuse herself from the case because of \u201cseeming bias and prejudice\u201d based on comments she made during a pretrial hearing last Friday. Tolan\u2019s legal team filed an emergency motion and affidavit, on his behalf, asking Judge Harmon to recuse herself from the case, citing in documents that the comments at the pretrial hearing \u201cdisclose that the judge can no longer be an impartial arbiter of this case.\u201d The affidavit filed by Robbie also alleged that Judge Harmon\u2019s comments would taint the federal jury pool and hamper his ability to receive a fair trial. In response to their request, Judge Harmon denied the recusal reconsideration motion on Monday. \n \nIn her order, Judge Harmon stated that she \u201chas never expressed a personal bias or prejudice against Robert R. Tolan or in favor of Jeffrey Cotton.\u201d She went on to say in her order that, based on case law: \u201cWhen a judge makes a ruling or says or does something in the course of pretrial or trial proceedings, impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned simply because one side wins and the other loses.\u201d \n \nIn what was a stunning blow to Robbie and his attorneys \u2013 that essentially forced them to the settlement table \u2013 Judge Harmon denied every single expert witness submitted by the Tolan legal team who were being called to testify on behalf of Tolan, while allowing the City of Bellaire to allow all of the witnesses they submitted to the court to testify. Judge Harmon then released an 18-page order preventing Tolan\u2019s legal team from presenting former Major League Baseball players, sports agents, excessive force specialists and others from testifying as expert witnesses. \n \nSome of the expert witnesses that the Tolan legal team submitted to testify included former MLB professionals such as Ken Griffey Jr. and Ken Griffey Sr. \n \nTolan\u2019s attorneys and the Tolan family began to have settlement discussions, which led to a settlement eventually being reached. \n \nOfficer Cotton was made to testify, under oath in court, that he had no assets to settle the lawsuit, which put the burden on the City of Bellaire to pay the settlement amount to Tolan. According to the Tolan legal team, the attorneys presented their accord to Judge Harmon on Tuesday morning, the day the trial was to begin, where they demanded that the City of Bellaire draw up the settlement documents in court. Furthermore, Tolan\u2019s attorneys demanded the written agreement be fleshed out in court and fully agreed upon before it was signed and this ordeal was laid to rest. For the Tolan family, it is closure concerning this case, but not concerning the continuous injustice in this country \u2013 an injustice they will continue to fight. \n \n\u201cWe did not get justice here,\u201d said Marian Tolan, Robbie\u2019s mother. \u201cThe first time the judge dismissed our case, we had to pay Officer Cotton\u2019s court fees. That was another injustice. I\u2019ve had to watch his dreams and part of his spirit die. We gave up so much as a family for a chance at justice, a chance at peace.\u201d \n \nMarian said that she believes God kept her son on this earth for a reason and insists that they are going to continue to work hard for changes in the justice system. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up,\u201d said Marian. \u201cThere are some things that need to be changed and we\u2019re going to work toward that change. The justice that we seek will not come from these courts, it will come from us.\u201d \n \nAttorney Benjamin Crump said that he and Robbie will begin to aggressively push for police body cameras on a national scale. They are both scheduled to appear on several panels at this week\u2019s Annual Legislative Conference (ALC), hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington D.C., where they will address police brutality and the need for body cameras. \n \n\u201cAs an attorney, the courtroom is our arena. Robbie Tolan is not an attorney, so he is going to take his case to an arena most favorable to him, that arena is the court of public opinion,\u201d said Crump. \u201cGod left Robbie Tolan here for a reason. Robbie is here to tell his own story. This family can now focus on the Robbie Tolan foundation and Robbie\u2019s book.\u201d \n \nRobbie still believes that his case is going to help a lot of people because the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court now states that a judge can no longer look at one side\u2019s evidence and not the others \u2013 which is what happened in Robbie\u2019s case.", "source": "Black Press USA"}
