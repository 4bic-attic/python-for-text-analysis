From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. \n \nHowever, in a study, the researchers concluded that the likely health risks from arsenic in red wines depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. \n \n\u201cUnless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there is little health threat if that is the only source of arsenic in your diet,\u201d said researchers Denise Wilson, professor at University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n\u201cBut consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice \u2014 all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning \u2014 you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly,\u201d Wilson noted. \n \nThe study that tested 65 wines from America\u2019s top four wine-producing US states \u2014 California, Washington, New York and Oregon \u2014 found all but one have arsenic levels that exceed what is allowed in drinking water. \n \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency allows drinking water to contain no more than 10 parts per billion of arsenic. \n \nThe wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. \n \nThe study looked at red wines because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. \n \nThe findings appeared in the Journal of Environmental Health. \n Related Posts", "source": "Mangalorean"}
