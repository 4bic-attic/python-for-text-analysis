She was running against Barbara Boxer. She lost in a landslide, but during the run she was really horrible about Barbara Boxer\u2019s looks,\u201d Trump said. \n\nHe was apparently referring to a moment during the race when Fiorina was caught on a hot mic, saying Boxer\u2019s hair was \u201cso yesterday.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing the game herself,\u201d Trump added. \n\nTrump raised eyebrows last week when he seemed to ridicule Fiorina\u2019s face in an interview with Rolling Stone. \n\n\u201cLook at that face. Would anyone vote for that?\u201d he was quoted as saying. \n\nTrump later argued he was referring to her \u201cpersona.\u201d \n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s CNN Republican debate, the two rivals faced off in one of the night\u2019s most highly-anticipated moments. Fiorina calmly said that she believed \u201cevery woman\u201d in America knew what Trump was referring to in his Rolling Stone comments, but Trump maintained he had not criticized her appearance. \n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s got a beautiful face, and I think she\u2019s a beautiful woman,\u201d Trump said. \n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Thursday, Fiorina said sexism remains in American politics. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still different for women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a woman whose appearance would be talked about while running for president \u2014 never a man. And that\u2019s what women understand.\u201d", "source": "1490Wosh.com"}
