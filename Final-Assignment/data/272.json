General Assembly. \n\nDevelopment programs are working, Obama said, but results can improve if the U.S. and other countries can address such issues\u00a0as bad governance; gender, racial, and income inequality; fulfilling the economic potential of Africa; and the ravages of wars. \n\nObama also cited the global challenge\u00a0he plans to emphasize throughout\u00a0his U.N. meetings: climate change. \"All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate,\" Obama said, especially poorer nations. \n\nAs Obama flew to New York City aboard Air Force One early Sunday, the White House announced an addition to his U.N. schedule: the Tuesday meeting with Castro, Obama's second face-to-face with the communist leader\u00a0since the U.S. and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in late 2014. \n\nThey met in April on the sidelines of a Summit of Americas meeting in Panama.\u00a0The two also spoke by phone earlier this month, before the visit of Pope Francis to both Cuba and the United States. \n\nThis is Castro's first trip to the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly. \n\nAfter speaking at\u00a0a mid-afternoon meeting on the\u00a0U.N.'s\u00a0global development agenda,\u00a0Obama visited\u00a0the U.S. mission to the United Nations to meet with employees and their families. \n\nObama turns to domestic politics Sunday evening as he delivers remarks at a Democratic National Committee LGBT gala. \n\nIn addition to his annual address to the countries that make up the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 something Obama will do Monday morning \u2014 United Nations week gives the president a chance to meet one-on-one with a select group of other world leaders. \n\nIn addition to Castro,\u00a0Obama's meeting list this year includes India Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\u00a0President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, and\u00a0a potentially tense session with Russia President Vladimir Putin. \n\nTopics for the Putin meeting include U.S. objections to what it calls Russian aggression in Ukraine and concern about a Russian military build-up in Syria. \n\n\"Our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine will be front and center throughout our discussions,\" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. \n\nU.S. officials have also criticized Russian support for embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. \n\nPutin, who authorized a Russian annexation of the Ukraine area,\u00a0says he will protect the interests of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, and still objects to what he has called a 2014 \"coup\" of a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine. \n\nAs for Syria, Putin says he wants to help fight the Islamic State, and he criticized the U.S. for backing Syrian rebels seeking to topple Assad. \n\nThe American\u00a0\"provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of modern international law and the United Nations charter,\" Putin said on CBS' 60 Minutes. \n\nThe White House also said Sunday that, during\u00a0his Air Force One flight, Obama spoke by phone\u00a0with Chilean President\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Bachelet. \n\nIn addition to discussing the proposed\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Obama also offered Bachelet condolences for a Sept. 16 earthquake in Chile \"and inquired about the status of rebuilding and recovery efforts.\" \n\nFollow @djusatoday on Twitter", "source": "Mount Olive Tribune"}
