But the company has in recent years gone from from quietly tolerating mass produced goods to officially condoning them. Now it will start actively helping sellers find manufacturing partners to crank stuff out in volume. \n \nBeginning yesterday, Etsy\u00a0is accepting applications for its Etsy Manufacturing \u00a0program, which bring qualified manufacturers together with designers looking to ramp up production and move some serious product. The company asks that\u00a0manufacturers comply with its ethical guidelines , which forbid child labor and discrimination and mandate humane working conditions, but according to its site, it will \u201cnot vet or certify manufacturers.\u201d \n \nAnd so continues Etsy\u2019s evolution. During the past two years, the company has warmed up to mass manufacturing. First , it updated its terms and service last year to users to sell products manufactured by third parties. Then it launched Etsy Wholesale, a service that helps retailers purchase products from Etsy sellers in bulk. Now this. \n \nIdeally, the move will help its network of entrepreneurs\u2014 86 percent of whom are women \u2014launch and expand\u00a0their businesses. The catch is that long-time users have long complained that Etsy is betraying its roots \u00a0by allowing vendors to sell products they didn\u2019t make by hand. But for some sellers, this could be a win-win situation. Helping established sellers expand their businesses by finding manufacturers and landing wholesale contracts, could give Etsy a bigger piece of the pie as well. And those that are growing will need guidance as they scale up. The new services could help keep Etsy sellers who want to grow from moving to platforms like Crowd Suppy , which helps entrepreneurs crowdfund, market and manufacture their products. \n \nThe trick will be balancing both new, truly handmade vendors with growing, mass produced products. \n Go Back to Top.
