He has also written a book about his ministry to atheists tentatively titled, Confessions of a Pirate Chaplain. This book is currently being shopped by his agent, Wes Yoder. Jonathan was born in 1974 in Huntingburg, Indiana. He spent two weeks every summer with his grandma who allowed him to check out stories about Bigfoot, the Mothman and ghost stories from the library. This summer reading gave him a lifelong love for scary stories. Jonathan's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when he was in the sixth grade. After college, he went to Covenant seminary and graduated with a Masters of Divinity with honors. He is currently ordained in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. While pastoring two churches, one in Illinois and one in Florida, he began to write a fantasy book based on American mythology. After a move to Columbus, Ohio, Jonathan felt a call to campus ministry at The Ohio State University. During the transition from church ministry to campus ministry, he decided to write his second novel, The Faithful, which combined his knowledge of the church and his love for scary stories. Jonathan is the founder of The Thomas Society, a ministry dedicated to answering questions from doubters, agnostics and atheists. Along with the atheists at Ohio State, he won a Multicultural Award from the university. Because of his work with atheists, the Secular Student Alliance added him to their speaker's bureau. - www.jonathanweyer.com", "source": "The 'X' Zone Radio Show"}
