I love it with the Motherwell under-20s and my work with BT is terrific.\n\n\u201cIt would be a lot for me to give up.\n\n\u201cIt would be a big decision for the club to make if they think a young, inexperienced manager is the way forward.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever managed in senior football.\n\n\u201cIt will certainly be an interesting next week or so.\u201d\n\nIf Craigan is to get the Motherwell job full-time, he and his family will be hoping that he\u2019ll be able to savour matches more enjoyable than the workmanlike 2-1 success over Thistle.\n\nStephen said: \u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy that. My salaries over the last three years have been a lot more enjoyable than what that one was.\n\n\u201cI knew it was always going to be the case.\n\n\u201cThe game itself was never going to be a classic; two teams who are struggling for a little bit of form and struggling for a result.\n\n\u201cWe had the disappointment during the week (losing 3-2 to Morton after extra time in the League Cup third round).\n\n\u201cWe had 120 minutes in a lot of the players\u2019 legs. We knew it was just going to be of case of getting through.\u201d\n\n* As we went to press, one betting firm had Craigan as 2/1 favourite to be next \u2019Well manager, with Steven Pressley 5/2 and Mixu Paatelainen 4/1.", "source": "Motherwell Times"}
