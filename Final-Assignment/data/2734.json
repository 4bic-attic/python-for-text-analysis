Well, I can\u2019t. Many times I\u2019m told I\u2019m not on the list. \n      \nI want to be in the church by 9 a.m. Last Sunday, he came at 9:30 a.m. and said I\u2019m to be picked up at 9:30 a.m. I think the driver does what he wants to do. \n \nWednesday I had a doctor\u2019s appointment. I got to the doctor\u2019s office at 1:45 p.m. That was good. Twenty minutes later, a van driver came into the waiting room and asked if I was ready to go home. I hadn\u2019t even seen the doctor yet and I never saw the van driver again. The office girls had called two times after seeing the doctor. They called again. They were closing the office. At that time, a van pulled up. It started to rain and a pleasant driver said it wasn\u2019t his fault. \n \nThen there was Sept. 13. It must have been one of those that think they\u2019re the boss and do as they please. I saw a van go through the parking lot at least 25 miles an hour with no thought of stopping. \n \nYou know, there is a saying \u201cWhat goes around \u2013 comes around.\u201d You get paid back sometime \u2013 just wait. I\u2019m going to do what I can! \n \nClara Delaney \n \nUniontown", "source": "Herald-Standard"}
