He's also added 301 rushing yards and two rushing scores. \n\nComing off Kaepernick's career-high four interception game against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3, McCarthy said he still sees a talented player leading the 49ers offense. Kaepernick has accounted for seven touchdowns (five passing; two rushing) in his two home victories over the Packers. He once threw for a career-high 412 yards in a Week 1 victory over Green Bay in 2013. Kaepernick also set a single-game postseason rushing record by a quarterback with a 181-yard outing against the Packers in the 2012 postseason. \n\"He\u2019s definitely a challenge to prepare for,\" said the coach of the 3-0 Packers, who will face the 49ers at Levi's\u00ae Stadium on Sunday. \n\nWhen asked about how the teams have changed since those three previous losses to the 49ers in 2012 and 2013, McCarthy made it sound like he's focused more on the 2015 version of his team than what's happened in the past. \n\nGreen Bay's high-powered offense will match up against a new-look 49ers defense. McCarthy said Eric Mangini's reputation as a creative defensive coach remains intact. \n\n\"I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have some wrinkles for us,\" McCarthy said. \n \nAfter noting the changes in defensive personnel for the 49ers, the Packers coach said, \"We\u2019ve changed a lot since then, too.\" \n\nGreeen Bay totaled seven sacks in a Week 3 \"Monday Night Football\" win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Aaron Rodgers added five touchdown passes in a brilliant performance. \n\n\"He just keeps getting better,\" McCarthy said of the NFL's early MVP candidate. \"I don\u2019t know how much better he can play, frankly. You never know with Aaron. \u2026 He\u2019s played great the first three weeks, and we\u2019ll just keep working. Hopefully he stays on course. He\u2019s playing at an extremely high level.\" \n\nAnother player who has caught the eye of Green Bay's coach is San Francisco's second-year running back Carlos Hyde . The physical 49ers rusher is one of two running backs in the NFL with 250-plus rushing yards and two rushing scores through three weeks of the 2015 season. \n\n\"Carlos has had very impressive film,\" McCarthy said. \"He\u2019s someone we\u2019re definitely focused on. I think he\u2019s off to a heck of a start.\" \n\nThe same can be said for the Packers. But McCarthy is not letting early success alter how he coaches his team. \n\n\"Let\u2019s be real here,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do as a football team.\"", "source": "NFL"}
