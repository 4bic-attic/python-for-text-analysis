They are also subsidised to the tune of \u00a326.7bn in tax breaks and housing benefit. The cost of landlord subsidies to Britons is \u00a31011 per household (Sources: Guardian) \u201cWhilst there are no doubt some good private landlords who do look after tenants so to speak, the sector is in need of regulation and if rent rises continue the way they are doing when buy to let mortgage repayments are low, then private landlords should be made to improve their properties with any rent rise that they slap on their properties. We only have to look at the state of a great many privately let houses in Bolton to see that there is something wrong.\u201d Steve Jones\nMorris Green\nBolton Reply \u2013 I read Steve Jones\u2019 letter regarding \u201crents rip-off\u201d. \u201cHe seems to be under the impression that private tenants receive the full amount of their rent from housing benefits and that \u201crip-off\u201d landlords are profiting from the benefits system. \u201cHe should be aware that the Local Housing Allowance which is paid in Bolton is a set figure based only on the bedrooms required by the tenants and their family circumstances. In many cases, tenants have to make up the shortfall between their Local Housing Allowance and the actual rent payable. \u201cCapping rents will not reduce benefits payments but will almost certainly add to the housing shortage by reducing the numbers of private rental properties available since properties in the social sector are insufficient to meet demand. \u201cThe majority of...\nprivate rental landlords are people like myself, who have invested their pension lump sums to provide themselves with an income in retirement. They, quite rightly, expect to have a reasonable return for their investment and if this is prevented by rent capping, they will look elsewhere for investments and will not be purchasing property. Landlords do not make vast fortunes from their rented property. \u201cThey have to maintain their property to suitable standards, making sure that the property is safe and habitable. They also run a high risk from tenants who run up large amounts of arrears of rent and damage to property and landlords have to pay expensive legal fees to get their property back from tenants who refuse to pay their rent or to move out. \u201cSo you see Steve, it is not \u2018all beer and skittles\u2019 for most of us, as you call \u201crip-off\u201d landlords. \u201cThe majority of us charge reasonable rents and are responsible people who care about our tenants. There is no such thing as \u2018a free lunch\u2019 or a \u2018free roof over your head\u2019. Someone is footing the bill. You would not expect to go to the supermarket and get free groceries. They expect to make a profit on what you buy and so do landlords on their investment. Stop landlord-bashing. The majority of us provide decent homes for people, expecting only a reasonable return on our investment.
