Stafford, scrambling out of the pocket, slowed down before running out of bounds. Barr shoved him from behind, sending the Detroit quarterback skidding into his own team's bench. \n\nThe fact that Stafford slowed down and, in essence, gave up on the play before it was actually over is why the hit should not have drawn a 15-yard infraction. \n\n\"That was not a very smart penalty by any stretch of the imagination,\" Zimmer originally said, per Chris Tomasson of the Pioneer Press, before consulting with NFL officials. \"I expect our guys to play with more poise than that.\" \n\nThe confusion surrounding the hit on Stafford won't have much of an effect on Barr's play moving forward. He can rest easy now, knowing that his hit was, in fact, clean. \n\n(h/t @Andrew_Krammer)", "source": "LocalNews7.com"}
