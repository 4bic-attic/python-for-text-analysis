Ten resulted in touchbacks, the other two were short kicks that were not returned. Add it up and Cal ranks last in the Pac-12 with an 18.6-yard return average. \n \n\r\r \n  \n\"It's been a weird year\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. \"Our sample size is too small to draw a lot of conclusions. It has to get better, just like our kick coverage. \n  \n\"We'll give it some attention this week, that's for sure.\" \n  \nDavis, selected as a preseason second-team All-America kick returner by The Sporting News, has returned just two kicks for a 21.5 average. He says he's not frustrated by the outcome and that the return team is executing well. But he's impatient for a breakthrough. \n  \n\"Kick return is a hard thing to do. Everyone has to do their one-in-11,\" Davis said. \"That's why Washington State was such a crazy thing. We're waiting for the opportunity where everything goes right, when we find the perfect chute.\" \n  \nThe Bears have done no better on kick coverage, where they rank 11th in the Pac-12 and have kicked deep enough for touchbacks just five times on 33 kicks. \n  \nNoting that the Bears settled for field goals three times in the 30-24 win at Washington, failed to convert a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, and had a fumble returned 70 yards for a touchdown, quarterback Jared Goff said, \"That's potentially five touchdowns we left on the field.\" \n  \nLawler was on the ground, his helmet having come off during a collision with defensive back Kevin King, when replays showed UW linebacker Azeem Victor came down and hit him in the back of the head with his right elbow. \n  \nFor more on Cal sports, see the Bear Talk blog at .
