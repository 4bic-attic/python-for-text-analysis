It was the last album of new material they recorded together although Let It Be would be released later. \n\nCoincidentally, John Lennon gave us Walls and Bridges five years later. It was recorded in Los Angeles during his \u201cLost Weekend\u201d and featured Lennon\u2019s only solo No. 1 hit, the Elton John collaboration, \u201cWhatever Gets You Through the Night.\u201d Motley Crue\u2019s Shout at the Devil was their second effort and gave them their first charting singles in \u201cLooks That Kill\u201d and \u201cToo Young to Fall in Love.\u201d David Bowie reunited with Brian Eno for Outside, which was a concept album about a futuristic dystopia. \n\nBallbreaker saw AC/DC work with Rick Rubin and bring drummer Phil Rudd back into the group. The Velvet Underground\u2019s Peel Slowly and See packaged their four studio albums with Lou Reed and previously unreleased material together inside a five-CD boxed set. Roger Waters released Ca Ira, an opera about the French Revolution. \n\nTensions between Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon boiled over, with the Who singer breaking the drummer\u2019s nose. Daltrey was fired from the band, but reinstated when it was determined he was too valuable to the rising group. \n\nWatch an exciting recap of many of the day\u2019s biggest rock anniversaries above, narrated by our radio host Zach Martin.
