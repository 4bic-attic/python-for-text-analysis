Mapsense is best when it\u2019s\u00a0taking large batches of interactive location data, and making them\u00a0embeddable into apps. From Re/Code: Mapsense was formed in 2013 by Erez Cohen, a former engineer for the data science company Palantir Technologies.\u00a0The company\u2019s\u00a0offering lets users slice and dice graphical models of maps that hold huge sums of data. It\u2019s cloud-based, naturally. Apple gave its usual non-answer about the acquisition (\u201cApple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,\u201d if you\u2019re curious), but there\u2019s probably good reason for this purchase. Large, location-tagged data sets immediately available to users \u2014 that sounds a lot like Waze to me. While Mapsense\u2019s current trajectory isn\u2019t positioned as such, it would make sense for Apple to\u00a0add real-time traffic data from users. As was written\u00a0in our iOS 9 review, Apple Maps is a solid backbone service for other software, specifically when you use Spotlight search. If I want to hit up that cool pizzeria I stumbled upon last month, user-generated traffic info about a road closure may prompt me to take the train rather than drive. And we know Apple Maps is pretty good with transit information. A bit of wishful thinking, here? Absolutely. If Apple is going to gently nudge us into Apple Maps at various turns in iOS, I\u2019d love to see it round into shape as a proper Google Maps challenger. User-reported road incidents would be a huge step in the right direction. Apple Acquires Mapsense, a Mapping Visualization Startup on Re/Code", "source": "The Next Web"}
