Stephen Ross, M.D., \n      Medical Informatics Specialist, and Brian Laberge, Director of Client \n      Services Strategy, will discuss the critical role terminology management \n      strategies play in achieving success with population health management \n      (PHM) and data analytics.  \n  \nScheduled for September 30 at 11:15 a.m. in Rooms 271-273 of the New \n      Orleans Convention Center, the presentation will highlight the \n      challenges healthcare organizations currently face when laying a \n      foundation for semantic interoperability. Presenters will discuss the \n      need for efficient strategies to address data normalization of clinical \n      terminologies coming from inbound and outbound sources, and attendees \n      will learn the value of enterprise code group management and how to \n      align a broader enterprise terminology management strategy with data \n      analytics and PHM efforts. \n \nIdentified as important strategies for healthcare organizations \n      operating within risk-bearing reimbursement arrangements, PHM and data \n      analytics require high-level information sharing capabilities. Because \n      the industry lacks a universal terminology standard, data must be \n      normalized upon intake to support semantic interoperability; otherwise \n      there are inevitable conflicts with management and distribution when \n      clinical information is shared between organizations. \n \n'As the movement to value-based care marches forward, healthcare \n      organizations must deploy infrastructures that will support \n      sophisticated data analytics and effective management of population \n      health,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David A. Del Toro, President & CEO of Clinical Software \n      Solutions at Wolters Kluwer. 'Terminology management strategies are \n      foundational to this process, and Health Language solutions are on the \n      leading edge of this movement, equipping healthcare organizations with \n      the technology-enabled workflows and capabilities needed to position for \n      success.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n \nDesigned to enable effective clinical information exchange, the Health \n      Language family of products including LEAP Code Group Manager will be \n      featured at AHIMA (Booth #812). Wolters Kluwer's enterprise terminology \n      management platform provides the software, content, and consulting \n      solutions needed to map, translate, update, and manage standard and \n      enhanced clinical terminologies on an enterprise scale, enabling the \n      information liquidity required to support such healthcare challenges as \n      Meaningful Use compliance, ICD-10 conversion, population health \n      management, and analytics. \n \nArticle source - Business Wire, all right reserved.
