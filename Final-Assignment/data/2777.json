As well as helping me to fish again, they\u2019ve helped me at home. \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t read my newspaper before so when I visited the centre for the first time I was given a CCTV magnifier which now means that I can put my newspaper underneath and read it again. \n\n\u201cI also attended the annual lunch event that Blind Veterans UK held in Liverpool at Anfield which was really good. While I was there, I spoke to one of the staff about a keyboard with large keys for my laptop at home. \n\n\u201cThey provided me with one and I can now sit and type away all day! It\u2019s really helped me to regain my independence.\u201d \n\nBlind Veterans UK is the national charity for blind and vision impaired ex-Service men and women, providing vital practical and emotional support to help veterans, like John, discover life beyond sight loss. \n\nIf you, or someone you know, served in the Armed Forces or did National Service and are now battling severe sight loss call the charity on 0800 389 7979 or go to www.noonealone.org.uk . \n\nFormerly St Dunstan\u2019s, Blind Veterans UK believes that no one who has served our country should have to battle blindness alone. \nAtlantic Drifters bring ocean rowing boat to Grosvenor Rowing Club Contact the Chester Chronicle Send a story The Editor Journalists", "source": "Chester Chronicle"}
