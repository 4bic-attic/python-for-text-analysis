We paint, we watercolor, we dust away embossing powder. And now and then they get old and ratty or someone forgets to clean them and leaves them out to dry. Ahem. It seems such a shame that they get thrown away.\rHubby was the main culprit behind this brush but as he does all the painting around the house for me I can't complain. Also...it turned into a fun art project.\rI decided to start by adding some gold paint to the bottom of the hardened paint on the brush to glam it up a little. The handle was then covered with tissue paper and a gel medium.\rThe fun part for me is always the embellishing and Maya Road makes that oh so amazing! There's a mix of trims, charms, pearl clusters and bling all mixed together to make it beautiful.\rOn the brush handle I stamped the word create from the Art Journaling Words stamp set. It's my go-to stamp set for altered projects and I adore it. A little chipboard tag holds some trim and embellishment accents and the word art.\rI have this little section of wall in my craft room that's not big enough for storage so I think this altered brush will hang there and inspire me to create each day. Look around your house for things to alter. You never know what can be turned into art next!\rMaya Road Supplies Used:\rRound Jeweled Centers\rCrystal Flower Buttons\r@ Clips\rVintage Pale Pink Pearl Ball Pins\rTeardrop Pearl Centers\r\u00a0L'Amour Eiffel Tower Charms\rArt Journaling Words Stamp Set\rDaisies Vintage Lace Trim\rCrafting Jute Cording\rMini Banner Crochet Trim", "source": "Maya Road Design Team"}
