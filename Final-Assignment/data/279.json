Most riders want a great time on the bike, exploring nature, having a good workout and still getting back to the race village by lunchtime to swap war stories.\u201d \n \nHe said the daily stages would be a manageable 55km to 70km, with climbs not exceeding 1 500m. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re cutting out all the unnecessary climbs and building contour trails to create spectacular vistas with maximum impact. \n \n\u201cYou want to build a trail where the scenery surprises you. Where a tunnel through dense vegetation suddenly opens up, or a winding trail turns another corner, and delivers a breath-taking view.\u201d \n \nWhile some of the trails would be open to the public, Kriegler said the key linking sections would be exclusively used by the race. \n \nEnter at www.capewinelands.capetown .", "source": "MarathonMTB.com"}
