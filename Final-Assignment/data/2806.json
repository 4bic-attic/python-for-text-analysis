Meanwhile in a joyless, north-facing, little-used room called the Library you\u2019ll find Robert Pattinson, the 29-year-old British actor. He\u2019s not tanned; famously, he has the pallor of an eternally youthful bloodsucker. He\u2019s not smug either; in fact it would be hard to find someone less pleased with themselves. And he\u2019s come to Shoreditch House today to work \u2013 to do interviews anyway, one of the least enjoyable elements of a job that he\u2019s not convinced he\u2019s especially good at.\nDoes Pattinson come here often? \u201cUm, yeah, kind of, er. Ish,\u201d he eventually decides on. \u201cI used to go to the gym here until I realised that I didn\u2019t want people to see me going to gym.\u201d He laughs, a posh, unexpected, winning guffaw. \u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to lift up your 10lb dumbbells\u2026 Word spreads.\u201d\nPattinson is monochromatic today: white T-shirt and thin jacket; black jeans, boots and unmarked baseball cap. He has a bushy beard (our pictures were taken before he grew it). It\u2019s the kind the Victorians favoured, with a twiddly moustache, for a part he\u2019s currently shooting. \u201cOh, this is driving me insane,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me know if I\u2019ve got something hanging off the side. Avocados are especially bad.\u201d Pattinson strokes his chin: \u201cHmmm, yeah, avocados are not beard-friendly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s around this point, maybe a couple of minutes in, that I realise I\u2019m going to quite like Pattinson. It is not particularly something he\u2019s said, but his, for want of a better word, vibe. If anyone could be forgiven for being an oddball, it\u2019s him. Any chance Pattinson had of a normal career \u2013 a normal life \u2013 vanished when he appeared, aged 22, as the vampire Edward Cullen in 2008\u2019s Twilight. Over five films he became very rich, unpleasantly famous and kinkily lusted over. One example: last year in Las Vegas, a woman married a life-size cardboard cutout of Pattinson; on their honeymoon, she carried \u201chim\u201d up to the Hollywood sign.\nSuch attention, such unsolicited devotion, would be a brain scramble for anyone. But what\u2019s endearing about Pattinson is that it is easy to see the kind of person he was before he became one of the most famous actors in the world. He\u2019s a bit of a goof. He\u2019s prone to gabbling about, say, having a gloop of avocado on his face.\nIn short, Pattinson doesn\u2019t carry himself like he\u2019s God\u2019s gift. He remains recognisably a 20-something from suburban London whose dad sold vintage cars and whose mum was a model booker.\nThe most interesting thing about Pattinson these days is the career he\u2019s curating. To oversimplify it, pretty much any director would want Pattinson in their film: he has a name that gets a project green-lit and a fanbase that means people are sure to see it. Yet he has chosen to use this power in an unconventional way. Sometimes he actively seeks out filmmakers who he admires: \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of them, and I like quite specific stuff.\u201d He doesn\u2019t demand the biggest role or for his name to be in the largest type on the film poster \u2013 though that\u2019s usually what happens anyway. He\u2019s worked with cult auteur David Cronenberg twice (Cosmopolis and Maps to the Stars) and with Werner Herzog, as TE Lawrence in the forthcoming Gertrude Bell biopic, Queen of the Desert, alongside Nicole Kidman and James Franco. He\u2019s just signed up to play an astronaut in Zadie Smith\u2019s first screenplay.\nAnd this month Pattinson stars in Anton Corbijn\u2019s Life, a warm, perceptive film about James Dean. But Pattinson isn\u2019t playing Dean; he is Dennis Stock, a Magnum photographer who befriended the actor in 1955 and took the iconic shot of him walking in Times Square, smoking, huddled against the rain. Pattinson insists he didn\u2019t, even for one second, consider lobbying for the role of Dean, a role taken by Dane Dehaan.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin,\u201d says Pattinson. \u201cI guess the only reason anyone would think that is from Twilight, because people always said about \u2018brooding\u2019. I\u2019m not entirely sure what brooding is, other than a chicken sitting on her eggs. So I\u2019m not entirely sure why that\u2019s considered an attractive trait.\u201d\nThere are, however, intriguing parallels to be drawn between Dean and Pattinson, two of the defining stars of their eras, or at least an examination of how the nature of celebrity has changed in the 60 years between their respective peaks. In Life, Dean is caught on the cusp of fame, shortly before the release of his debut film, East of Eden (in the ensuing eight months he would shoot two more films, including Rebel Without a Cause, before dying in a car crash aged 24). The studio, Warner Bros, puts him forward for interviews and Dean mucks them up, partly through inexperience, partly through sabotage.\nPattinson certainly knows how that feels. \u201cWhen the first Twilight came out, I\u2019d definitely say dumb stuff just so I wouldn\u2019t sound cookie-cutter or part of the machine,\u201d he recalls. For the most part this was pretty tame, such as admitting he took a Xanax before his final audition to calm his nerves or saying that he had been drunk for a year before he landed the part, living in a \u201ccool little ex-crack den\u201d with his best friend, the actor Tom Sturridge. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult to shock people when you can literally just swear,\u201d Pattinson says, laughing again. \u201cYou talk about being hungover and you just see the publicity department waving their arms going: \u2018Shut up! Shut up!\u2019\u201d\nIn other ways, though, Life makes it clear how much the interaction between celebrities and the media has changed. Stock, at Dean\u2019s encouragement, follows the actor home to Indiana, to the farm where he grew up with his uncle and aunt in a Quaker household. The intimacy of their exchanges \u2013 and the photographs that relationship produced \u2013 would be unimaginable in the present day.\nPattinson concedes as much. \u201cThe idea of taking a photographer back to my family\u2019s house\u2026 it\u2019s just insane!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really even to do with the photographs \u2013 it might be nice to have a really good photographer do it, but it\u2019s bringing your family into the public domain and then having to have them deal with this horrible cacophony of demons who live on the internet. That\u2019s really ruined a lot of things, internet trolls, because no one wants to put themselves out there. Even if you can ignore it, and I don\u2019t think anyone can really ignore it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s not anger in Pattinson\u2019s voice, just acceptance of the uncomfortable Faustian pact he\u2019s made for success in his chosen field. \u201cWith my sisters\u201d \u2013 Victoria and Lizzy, both older; Lizzy, a singer, appeared on last year\u2019s X Factor, reaching the stage where hopefuls audition at the judges\u2019 houses \u2013 \u201cyou just bring people into something they have not asked to be part of,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for you to stop it afterwards. All you can say is: \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for bringing this darkness into your life. And also you don\u2019t get anything out of it either.\u2019 It\u2019s just nothing but bad, yeah.\u201d\nPlenty of people in entertainment and outside it really want to be famous. Pattinson, meanwhile, more than any public figure I\u2019ve encountered, appears to be desperate to be less well-known than he is. The point where celebrity was useful to him is long distant. He already has more money than he knows how to spend. In Los Angeles he bought a house \u2013 \u201clike Versailles,\u201d he\u2019s described it \u2013 but moved out after the paparazzi set up camp outside. He owns 17 guitars, but that\u2019s as far as extravagances go.\n\u201cFame is just in the way for Rob,\u201d says Anton Corbijn, who has considerable experience of working with superstars, first as a portrait photographer and more recently as a film director. \u201cWe were shooting in a really cold winter in Toronto and there were days where it was definitely -22C and still there would be some paparazzo photographer hanging in a tree somewhere for a whole day. Even in extreme circumstances, in the middle of nowhere, he gets followed. That must be tiresome.\u201d\nWould Pattinson want to be less recognisable, then? \u201cI don\u2019t even think I am that famous anymore,\u201d he says unconvincingly. \u201cI just moved back to London and the thing that always drove me crazy in LA was photographers. You don\u2019t even really care about having your photograph taken, but it\u2019s the following, the trailing, knowing that you can\u2019t escape it. But I moved back to London and it just doesn\u2019t happen ever.\u201d\nReally? \u201cUh huh. Unless you\u2019re at the Chiltern Firehouse or somewhere. That\u2019s it. The infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist here. And celebrity press \u2013 they are interested in different things in England. Which is wonderful!\u201d\nHe might be giving us too much credit there. Pattinson\u2019s relationships are a staple of gossip columns, especially since he split with Kristen Stewart, his Twilight co-star, in 2012. He is currently stepping out with, and almost certainly engaged to, the singer FKA Twigs \u2013 hence the return to London \u2013 but he\u2019s learned enough to keep it on the down-low. When I raise the subject today, he replies, good-naturedly: \u201cOh yeah, that. I\u2019ve just found if you never talk about stuff it\u2019s better. But thank you.\u201d\nPattinson\u2019s personal experience, of enduring Twilight and coming out the other side, does seem to have left a residual interest in the smaller cogs in the machinery of Hollywood. In last year\u2019s Maps to the Stars he played an aspiring actor and writer who is really a chauffeur and has an unlikely hook-up with a neurotic big-time actress played by Julianne Moore. In Life his character Dennis Stock witnesses up close what the movie industry is starting to do to James Dean. The lesson, in both cases, appears to be that it\u2019s not easy to remain sane in this business.\nPattinson, though, sees it differently: it\u2019s not that movie stars are weird; everyone is weird. \u201cI think people are pretty extreme,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at anyone\u2019s behaviour, you meet a lot of nutcases. I can hang out with my family and it\u2019s like a mental asylum.\u201d He\u2019s laughing hard now. \u201cThey\u2019ll be like: \u2018Oh, why are you saying this about us?\u2019\u201d\nActing, Pattinson insists, remains a learning process; he never studied it and he became Edward Cullen when he still thought he wanted to be a musician rather than an actor. This leads to a bizarrely self-deprecating estimation of his talents. Pattinson rarely watches his own performances \u2013 he has still never seen the final Twilight movie \u2013 but he does assiduously seek out negative comments on the internet. \u201cI do read reviews to a fault, and it\u2019s an awful thing to do,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s an addiction. And you only read the bad ones, too, just to foster hatred, self-hatred, self-loathing. Yeah, weird habit.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s insecurity, but he\u2019s far more gifted than he gives himself credit for,\u201d says Corbijn. \u201cObviously success came relatively easy to Rob with the Twilight series, and ever since then he\u2019s taken on left-of-centre roles to prove \u2013 I guess to himself \u2013 that he is an actor and not just a famous actor. That\u2019s really courageous of him, but he underestimates his own quality. He\u2019s nervous. I think he beats himself up a lot \u2013 unnecessarily so, in my eyes.\u201d\nCorbijn describes \u201can inner turmoil\u201d he sees in Pattinson. Does Pattinson recognise that in himself? \u201cErr, ha ha, yeah, sort of,\u201d he replies. \u201cSometimes. I think everyone does, really, but I definitely feel like I need to prove something, and I\u2019m not entirely sure what it is. So that\u2019s probably what my turmoil is.\u201d\nPattinson goes silent for a few seconds. \u201cConfusion!\u201d he eventually exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m definitely very confused. I spent basically my whole 20s having no idea what was going on. And I do feel now that I\u2019m gaining a little bit of perspective.\u201d\nThe analysis session is almost over. Pattinson walks over to an upright piano by the window and idly plays a few notes. He started taking lessons again recently for the first time since he was a teenager; he thought he would be more enthusiastic this time, but practice is still a drudge. He closes the lid and finishes a thought from a couple of minutes before.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, I\u2019m quite proud that I\u2019m still getting jobs,\u201d Pattinson says. \u201cTo go from starting a job by accident when you\u2019re 16 and maintaining it somehow and learning how to do it on the job as well. Because of falling into a job, you always feel like you\u2019re a fraud, that you\u2019re going to be thrown out at any second. So yeah, the main thing I do hope is to gradually get rid of that and really be doing what you want to be doing without feeling like you\u2019re faking it. Does that make sense?\u201d\nWith his intriguing, ambitious post-Twilight career, it is making less and less sense, but it says a lot about Pattinson that he still thinks it.\nLife is out on 25 September\nSource", "source": "Robert Pattinson Life"}
