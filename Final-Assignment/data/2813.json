I don\u2019t try to find guys that can just play, but it\u2019s finding guys that match my goals and my style\u2026 They\u2019ve got to be ultra competitive kids who aren\u2019t satisfied with where they\u2019re at.\u201d \n\nThe three true freshmen \u2013 Mitchell White, Alex Scott and Bryce Messner \u2013 were all top 1,500 recruits who spurned the likes of Oakland, Iowa and Eastern Michigan in favor of GVSU. \n\nAlthough it was no easy task for Bissell to sign such talent, his email inbox suggests that it was no easy task for the new recruits to make the squad. \n\n\u201cI get flooded with emails on a weekly basis of kids wanting to play here,\u201d Bissell said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important thing\u2026 (My players) know not to take this for granted because I got an email list of 300 kids who are dying to play here. You can\u2019t take this for granted because as soon as you start to slip up, there\u2019s someone waiting to take your spot.\u201d \n\nThe same philosophy applies for Bissell and his active roster. \n\nThe third-year Laker coach starts with a clean slate at the beginning of each season. Seniors have to prove themselves as much as freshmen do. What players did last year matters as much as what players claim they can do. \n\nFor White, Scott and Messner, this philosophy couldn\u2019t be better. Under Bissell\u2019s watch, the best players will be the ones who play, regardless of class standing. \n\nWhite is riding a wave of confidence as he adjusts to the college life. The Muskegon, Michigan native recently won the 94 th GAM Championship in a two-hole playoff to top some of the best amateur golfers in the area. \n\nWhite brushed off Oakland and EMU to play for Bissell in Allendale. The chance to create a base for future success played a big role in his decision. \n\n\u201cMe and Bryce (Messner) kind of committed at the same time and we tried pushing Alex (Scott) and when he came we realized we could have something special with us all here,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey guys on the team were all really nice once I was on campus for my official visit.\u201d \n\nScott was in the running for the last spot at Michigan State, but ultimately chose to be a Laker over a Spartan largely because of Bissell\u2019s knowledge as a swing coach and ability to impact a player\u2019s game. \n\nThe Traverse City West High School alum earned All-State honors as a junior and is the most highly rated recruit of the three. \n\n\u201cMy original goal when I got here was that I want to become the best player I can possibly be,\u201d Scott said. But my first goal is to actually get into that top 5. I know it\u2019s not going to be anything easy. I\u2019m going to really look forward to the challenge because there are players here that are going to push me.\u201d \n\nThe final member of the trio is Messner, a Hartland High School graduate and All-State First Team member as a junior in 2014. Messner ranked in the 800s out of high school and fired a 146 at the GAM Championship. \n\nThe three freshmen will room together this year \u2013 yet another instance of internal competition. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to help rooming with Alex and Bryce,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m watching TV or something and someone says,  \u2018Hey I\u2019m going to the course\u2019, then I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wait, I\u2019ve got to practice with this guys, me and him are competing for the same spot.\u2019 Everyone is going to be pushing each other.\u201d \n\nThe Laker golf team could have a new look in 2016, but it just may be for the better. \n  Tweet", "source": "Grand Valley Lanthorn"}
