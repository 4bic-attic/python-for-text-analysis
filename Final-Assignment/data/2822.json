Complete with a golden hue, this peppery and earthy flavour makes its mark in many traditional South Asian and Middle Eastern meals. And while many people love to spice it up with turmeric, they may also want to incorporate it for its incredible health benefits as well.

Tasneem Bhatia, MD, author of What Doctors Eat, says that one way to treat bad skin with this spice is by blending turmeric with water or yogurt into a paste. 2.\u00a0Pain Before you pop another pill, try using turmeric, which is a much safer option for alleviating your pain. According to Isaac Eliaz, MD, founder of the Amitabha Clinic & Healing Center, this spice supports\u00a0circulation, immunity and tissue repair. 3.\u00a0Diabetes While you may assume it\u2019s simply steering clear of too much sugar that will help you to avoid diabetes, a study from Diabetes Care\u00a0found\u00a0that for people who were diagnosed with prediabetes,\u00a0taking daily curcumin capsules for nine months protected them from developing full-blown type 2 diabetes. 4 .\u00a0Bloating Eliaz says that gut inflammation can be a cause of bloating, which makes turmeric come at the top of the list for natural ways to relieve this condition.
