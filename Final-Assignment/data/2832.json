Two major international brands \u2014 H&M and Lush \u2014 just joined the campaign to end animal-testing in China , reports WWD . The movement, called #BeCrueltyFree China, is part of an ongoing campaign led by Humane Society International ( HSI ) and aims to introduce legislative bans on animal-testing and better treatment of farm animals, specifically sheep, that are subject to mulesing (which involves removing skin from sheep to be used in wool garments). \n\u201cAnimal welfare is important to us at H&M, and we want to contribute to improved animal welfare practices in our industry, which is why we are committing ourselves\u200b\u2026to elevate standards throughout the industry and globally,\u201d H&M environmental sustainability business expert Madelene Ericsson told WWD . \n\nUntil last year, China mandated that all cosmetics sold in the country be tested on animals, which resulted in the mistreatment of 100,000 to 300,000 rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, and other animals per year. While the lifting of the mandate in 2014 was an important step, there's still a long way to go \u2014 both in China and abroad. Currently, the EU does not allow the sale or marketing of products or ingredients that have been tested on animals. But, while frowned-upon, it is still legal in 80 percent of countries, including the U.S., according to HSI . \n\nWith more and more major beauty brands coming down hard on animal testing, it would appear that we're moving closer to ending these practices altogether. Until then, here is a list of all the companies who are recognized by Leaping Bunny as being cruelty-free.", "source": "Refinery29"}
