Henson's Style Evolved From Lil' Kim To Majorly Chic", "id": "4bc41ac7-441d-4173-bec2-a9c399b77179", "content": "Many fashion critics will argue that the skintight dresses and animal-print accessories worn by\u00a0 \"Empire\" \u00a0character Cookie Lyon \u00a0are what made Taraji P. Henson one to watch. Don't be so easily misled. The Emmy-nominated actress \u00a0has set red carpets ablaze with over-the-top outfits since her breakthrough role in 2001's\u00a0 \"Baby Boy.\"\u00a0 \n \nTaking leading roles as the strong-willed black woman, Henson has been finding her red-carpet footing throughout her career. She attended her earliest movie premieres rocking midriff-baring tops with flare-leg jeans and risqu\u00e9\u00a0leather numbers. In the September 2015 issue of Harper's Bazaar , the 45-year-old said it took her \"a minute to get on the chic bus.\" Henson explained, \"I was coming from the era of Lil' Kim and Mary J. Blige, you know, ghetto fabulous. I came from nothing, was deprived all my life, so when you get money, you go big!\" \n \nDecades later and with help from wardrobe stylists like Wouri Vice , Henson's off-camera fashion choices now include sophisticated gowns and sleek jumpsuits. But she's still got a bit of edge, thanks to interesting cut-outs and statement-making heels.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nAs we get ready to see what Cookie wears on\u00a0 Season 2 of \"Empire,\" \u00a0we're taking a look back at Henson's style over the years.\u00a0What's your favorite look?
