And now a woman is SUING him for allegedly being drugged and raped. Meanwhile, Rozay\u2019s possible mother-in-law is speaking out on her future son-in-law\u2019s bedroom antics. And she has an interesting take on the matter. More inside\u2026. When you make a track about drugging a female and having sex with her unbeknownst to her, you better get lawyered up because clearly someone will take your word for it\u2026whether it\u2019s true or not. Case in point: An anonymous woman has a filed a lawsuit against MMG honcho Rick Ross alleging that one of his associates drugged her, rapped her\u2026.and she \u201cain\u2019t even know it\u201d during GRAMMY weekend back in February. Here\u2019s what TMZ is reporting: The woman \u2014 who is ID\u2019d as Jane Doe in the lawsuit \u2014 claims she was at the W Hotel in L.A. where she met up with Rick and his entourage, who had invited her to go to Cannabis Cup \u2026 a weed convention.\nShe says she got in the van with Rick, a guy named Thaddeus \u201cBlack\u201d James, a DJ, 3 security guards and the driver. She says she was offered a glass of booze and shortly thereafter became dizzy and eventually passed out. She says the next thing she knew, 2 hours had passed and she was in the van with Black. The woman says she went back to Black\u2019s hotel room and passed out again. She woke up at 8 AM, examined herself and realized her clothes had been removed and she had been sexually assaulted. The woman believes Black is the one who raped her. Yikes! So why is she suing Rozay? Well she feels since the guy who allegedly violated her is Rozay\u2019s agent and it supposedly happened on his van, she wants him to pay up too. Sighs\u2026this all could be so easily avoided. In other Rozay news\u2026. We told you Rick Ross might have popped the question to his girlfriend Lira Galore a few days ago. Chick didn\u2019t waste any time to spread the word to the masses on her social media accounts. Yet, Ross still hasn\u2019t confirmed or denied the news yet. But, Lira\u2019s mother (above) seems super excited about the news letting one \u201cfan\u201d know that even IF the Bawse is cheating on her daughter, her baby is still winning. Oh? On Instagram, Lira\u2019s mom happily posted: In the comments, a follower responded to her post saying, \u201cBut he still f*ckin\u2019 my gf from Philly smh #fact guard your heart girl.\u201d Yikes! Well, Momma Galore quickly clapped back, \u201clmfao he a celebrity of course that\u2019s to be expected! Tf! U think we don\u2019t know that? As long as ya home girl getting wet a** while my baby getting diamonds, his heart & treated like a queen in his palace then who winning tho boo? Where ur friends diamonds at?\u201d Umm\u2026thoughts?
