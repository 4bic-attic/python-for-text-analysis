They organize like Far West duels - at this time we are going to fight, bring a translator to help us.\u201d \n  \nThe reality, according to Mourinho, is much less dramatic. And has much more to do with the effects of poor results. \n\n\u201cThe other direction you (the media) don\u2019t go is the direction which is real: you lose matches, you are affected, you lose confidence, you don\u2019t want the ball.\u201d \n\nHowever, despite its recent troubles, Chelsea will have been lifted by its 4-0 victory on Wednesday against Maccabi Tel-Aviv in the Champions League, despite Hazard missing an early penalty. \n\nHazard, who helped Chelsea win the Premier League last season, certainly has the public backing of his coach as the gifted Belgium playmaker tries to rediscover his form. \n  \n\u201cHe\u2019s the best player in England,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe is the best and he will be the best again. I don\u2019t know if it is tomorrow or if it is next week.\u201d \n\nWhile Chelsea has failed to click, Arsenal clearly has a few problems of its own. \n\nDespite having a solid 10 points on the board, Arsene Wenger\u2019s side has rarely looked really convincing this season and a re-shuffled team slumped to a 2-1 defeat away to Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League in midweek. \n\nFormer Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was on the bench, while Aaron Ramsey and Hector Bellerin and didn\u2019t even make the trip to Croatia. \n \n\r\r \n  \n\u201cIn football you have to forget cheap excuses and focus on what matters on the day, which is the performance on the day. If you want to make a career at a club without any disappointment, or individual disappointment, it is not possible,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI believe you can repair what happened. We are on a good run in the Premier League and it is important now to look at that.\u201d \n\nAs if it were needed, adding further spice to Saturday\u2019s game is the fact that the two managers clearly don\u2019t get along. \n\nThey squared up on the sidelines during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win last season and there was no handshake between the pair following Arsenal\u2019s 1-0 victory last month in the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium. \n  \nWenger brushed off the media scrutiny of his relationship with Mourinho, saying: \u201cNo special relationship is my worry. All I worry about is our performance tomorrow. \n\n\u201cI respect everybody in the job and focus on what I love and that is football. All the rest honestly does not concern me much.\u201d \n\nWenger wasn\u2019t concerned either by Chelsea\u2019s poor start to the season. \n\n\u201cIt can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget it is the start of the season and only five games have been played. \n\n\u201cFor us it is a big game and we know our position at the end of the season will depend on how well we do in the big games.\u201d", "source": "Los Angeles Daily News"}
