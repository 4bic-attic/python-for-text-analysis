( OTCQB: RGRX ) (\"the Company\" or \"RegeneRx\"), a clinical-stage drug development company focused on tissue protection, repair and regeneration, announced today that the first patients have been enrolled in a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial with RGN-259 (Thymosin beta 4), its sterile, preservative-free eye drop formulation developed for patients with dry eye syndrome, neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), and other corneal disorders. \u00a0The clinical trial is being sponsored by ReGenTree LLC, a joint venture between RegeneRx and GtreeBNT Co. Ltd. a Korean biopharmaceutical company and is being conducted by Ora Inc., an established contract research organization specializing in the field of ophthalmology.\u00a0 \n\nThe double-masked, placebo-controlled trial is being conducted at four sites, will enroll approximately 350 dry eye patients, and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\u00a0 The co-primary endpoints are assessments of total corneal staining and reduction of ocular discomfort in patients using RGN-259 compared to those using placebo.\u00a0 Patients will use the eye drops 4 times daily for 28 days and be assessed periodically throughout the trial and at completion of treatment.\u00a0 There will be numerous secondary endpoints that will also be evaluated pursuant to the trial protocol. \n   \n\"Enrollment of the first patient in our dry eye study marks an important milestone in the advancement of RGN-259, which was developed for this largely underserved market in the U.S. and abroad.\u00a0 The relatively short duration of the trial, with results expected early in 2016, makes this an exciting opportunity for our company and stockholders and, most importantly, patients suffering from dry eye syndrome,\" stated J.J. Finkelstein , RegeneRx's president and chief executive officer. \n\nThymosin beta 4 (T\u03b24), the \u00a0active ingredient in RGN-259, is a first-in-class, naturally occurring molecule that has been the subject of numerous published animal studies in the fields of ophthalmology, dermatology, cardiology, and central nervous system disorders, among others.\u00a0 In addition to the animal studies, the molecule has been tested in three unique formulations in approximately 350 patients and has an excellent safety profile.\u00a0 \n\nAbout RGN-259 (GBT-201) for the Treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome \nRGN-259 (designated GBT-201 in Korea) is a sterile, preservative-free topical eye drop for ophthalmic indications whose active ingredient is Thymosin beta 4 (T\u03b24). Based on U.S. Phase 2 clinical trials in moderate and severe dry eye syndrome, RGN-259 was found to show statistically significant improvements in several signs and symptoms of dry eye, as well as positive trends in other outcome measures.\u00a0 The data from these trials, as well as a recently completed clinical trial of RGN-259 in patients with NK, reflect RGN-259's mechanisms of action, support the \"protective\" effects of RGN-259, and provide RegeneRx with FDA-approvable clinical endpoints to be targeted in future clinical trials. \u00a0Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease and it is well known that T\u03b24 promotes cell migration and proliferation, modulates cytokines and/or chemokines related to inflammation, matures stem cells, and stimulates cell survival, all of which are believed to be important for effective treatment of DES. \n\nAbout RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
