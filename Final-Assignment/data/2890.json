INDOT Spokesman Harry Maginity says they are all at the intersection with County Road 550 South. \n \nINDOT maintenance crews are scheduled to be on site Monday to make cuts in the pavement, as well as excavate and replace existing drainage pipes. Maginity notes that two of those pipes have already failed. He adds that the third one is undersized and will be upgraded while the highway is closed. \n \nThe closure is expected to last four days. A state highway detour will route motorists around the closure via State Road 56, State Road 60, State Road 37 and U.S. Highway 50.", "source": "1010 WCSI"}
