World inventories before the start of next year\u2019s harvest are expected to climb to an all-time high as farmers reap bigger crops in the U.S., Russia and Ukraine. \n \nWheat futures have tumbled 22 per cent since the end of June, heading for the worst quarterly loss since 1986. American farmers are particularly struggling because they\u2019re saddled not just with bigger stockpiles, but also a rising dollar. The stronger currency is making exports from the U.S., the world\u2019s top shipper, more expensive for overseas buyers. \n \n\u201cYou have a lot of producers around the world coming in with pretty solid crops,\u201d said Sameer Samana, a St. Louis-based global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which oversees $1.6 trillion. \u201cYou have France, the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and others all jockeying to sell their wheat. That will probably continue to put pressure on prices.\u201d \n \nThe wheat net-short position, or bets on declines, totalled 39,382 futures and options in the week ended 15 September, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. The seven weeks of bearish outlook is the longest streak since late June. \n \nFutures dropped 18 per cent this year to $4.8325 a bushel in Chicago. The Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 components fell 16 per cent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities dropped 5.9 percent, and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gained 6.1 per cent. \n \nThere\u2019s not a lot of demand for all that grain. In the U.S., commitments for exports this season are trailing last year\u2019s pace by about 13 percent, government data show. French shippers are also having a hard time attracting buyers, and there\u2019s so much excess supply in the country that some silo operators are maxed out. \n \n\u201cInvestors are perpetually short because it\u2019s a market where you\u2019ve got a crop coming out of just about every country in the world,\u201d said John Stephenson, the chief executive officer of Stephenson & Co. Capital Management in Toronto, which oversees C$55 million ($41.6 million). \u201cIt\u2019s so well-supplied globally that it\u2019s never usually a problem getting your hands on wheat.\u201d \n \nBloomberg News, edited by ESM", "source": "European Supermarket Magazine"}
