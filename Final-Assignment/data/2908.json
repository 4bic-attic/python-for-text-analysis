Simon operated restaurants at several Las Vegas hotels including Palms Place and Harrah's. He and Harwell formed their own restaurant-hospitality management group in 2013 and opened four restaurants together with a fifth one still on the horizon.\n\nEven with the loss of his motor skills, Simon continued carrying out his vision for a planned fifth restaurant.\n\n\"He ate everything and made suggestions and comments and fixes,\" Harwell said. \"I learned more from him in the past two and a half years than a lifetime of working in and out of kitchens. I'll cherish that forever.\"\n\nKnown as the \"rock 'n' roll chef,\" Simon appeared on \"Iron Chef America\" in 2005 and beat Cat Cora in a hamburger challenge.\n\nHe first made a name for himself at age 34 as an executive chef at The Plaza Hotel in New York City, according to his company's website.\n\nHe gained a reputation for feeding some of the most famous names in the music world including Alice Cooper and the band Cheap Trick. But he loved to cook for anyone, Harwell said.\n\n\"An average Joe, he would treat the exact same way,\" Harwell said. \"There was no pretention.\"\n\nSimon is survived by three brothers.\n\nFuneral services have not been set.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
