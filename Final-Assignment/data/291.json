Trainer Charlie Appleby said: \"I was delighted with Tryster. He's back on track again having had a break after Sandown - he'd been on the go for the winter. You could question whether he adapted to turf, but I still feel it was the combination of the style of racing and small field.\n\n\"As we saw last night, he likes to be dropped in deep and come from off a sensible pace. He did it well and the plan now is to take him to Dubai, look at the second round of the Maktoum Challenge, and see how that works out. If it doesn't there's plenty of time to come back for another crack at the Winter Derby and Easter Classic.\"", "source": "RacingPost.com"}
