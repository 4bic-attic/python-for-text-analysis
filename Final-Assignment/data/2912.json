Although Connecticut and Maine have passed GE labeling laws, they don\u2019t take effect unless neighboring states adopt comparable measures. \n\nIn a lawsuit filed last year, the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), Snack Food Association, International Dairy Foods Association and National Association of Manufacturers moved to overturn Act 120. \n\nA federal judge, Christina Reiss, has denied the trade groups\u2019 petition for a preliminary injunction, provoking an appeal with the Second Circuit. The appeal briefs have been filed, and the court will next set a hearing for oral arguments, said Roger Lowe, a spokesman with GMA. \n\nReiss leaned in favor of a ruling that the GE labeling disclosure holds up under the First Amendment, but she indicated in her April 2015 ruling that the \u201cnatural\" ban was unconstitutional. Federal regulators have not defined the term, and GE foods that are marketed as \u201cnatural\" have been subject to a number of putative class-action lawsuits in recent years. \n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s speech ban,\" the food groups\u2019 31-page reply brief declared, \u201cimpermissibly attempts to make uniform its arbitrary view of what should be considered \u2018natural.\u2019\" \n\nWhether Act 120\u2019s GE disclosure survives may boil down to the judiciary\u2019s interpretation of whether Vermont\u2019s requirement is \u201cpurely factual and uncontroversial.\" The language comes from a 1985 decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that a disclosure requirement governing lawyer advertisements in Ohio did not violate the First Amendment\u2019s commercial speech protections. \n\nAccording to the food groups\u2019 brief, Act 120 fails to meet the \u201cpurely factual and uncontroversial\" prongs that the Supreme Court pronounced in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \u201cThe question of what it means (or does not mean) for a food to contain GE ingredients remains a subject of volatile public debate,\" the brief declared. \n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office previously countered in an Aug. 24 brief that \u201cthe compelled speech must itself be controversial.\" \n\n\u201cThere is nothing remotely controversial,\" Sorrell\u2019s legal team wrote in the brief, \u201cabout the purely factual statement \u2018produced with genetic engineering.\u2019\" \n\nThe food groups have argued Act 120 resembles a 1996 decision known as Int\u2019l Dairy Foods Ass\u2019n v. Amestoy. In that case, the Second Circuit examined a Vermont law that required labels for milk that was produced from cows treated with a growth hormone known as recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone or rGBH. The Second Circuit found Vermont\u2019s stated interests\u2014\u201cstrong consumer interest and the public\u2019s right to know\"\u2014were inadequate to justify the labeling requirement. \n\nSorrell has referenced other cases in which the courts have refused to subject commercial disclosures to so-called intermediate scrutiny under a Supreme Court test that the food groups claimed applies, rendering Act 120 unconstitutional. \n\nFor instance, in National Electrical Manufacturers (NEMA) v. Sorrell, the Second Circuit vacated a preliminary injunction against a law that required labels on certain products containing mercury. Like the labels in NEMA and two other cases, \u201cthe labels required by Act 120 disclose only factual and accurate information,\" Sorrell\u2019s office wrote in court papers. \n\nPlaintiffs, however, told the Second Circuit that the mercury law hardly resembles Act 120. \n\n\u201cVermont took the (uncontroversial) position that mercury pollution was harmful, and that the required labels advanced its \u2018goal of reducing mercury contamination,\u2019\" the food groups wrote in their recent brief. \u201cThe well-considered, scientifically supported, properly tailored mercury labeling law in NEMA is a far cry from Act 12", "source": "Global FoodMate"}
