The results, offered in the form of doses, are available on the www.i-doser.com website. Ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, opium, LSD, absinthe, name them one after the other, they are all listed under the doses offered by company i-Doser Labs, not counting more obscure drugs. What seems like an elaborate joke is dead serious: audio files simulate the brain activity while on drugs and create effects on the body. All that is necessary is a good pair of headphones, time and money (certain doses are offered free of charge to try).\n\nImpossible? That is not what are saying dozens of users on the official forums and on private websites. The technology, tested in laboratory, nails it most of the time. As described by user smoke a jointRON after his opium dose, \u2019\u2019during the dose my arms were very very tingly and sweaty and it felt like the blanket was hugging me. At the end i realized that my fists were clenched. I stood up and had no problem walking and that was it\u2019\u2019. Another one, joshkwas, describe his peyote dose : \u2019\u2019so im layin and listening and my arms and legs are numb. for like 1 minute i sorta felt like a was a picture in a book and the wind kept tring to blow me into the other pages\u2019\u2019. Similar testimonies are found everywhere, and that\u2019s only on the official website.\n\nContrary to conventional drugs, the website is completely legal and without danger for health. The various doses are only simulations, often on a lesser scale than the real things. Certain users are supposely using doses to counter their dependence.\n\nwww.i-doser.com\n\nMichael Bertiaux", "source": "ITnewslink.com"}
