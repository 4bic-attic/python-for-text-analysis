After more than two hours of keynote, it was finally time to kick back and watch some TV\u2014the brand-new Apple TV, that is. Here\u2019s what I saw in my hands-on time at Wednesday\u2019s special event. Interface The new interface just doesn\u2019t look new enough to me. It\u2019s quicker to navigate since you can \u201cswipe\u201d through lists with the touchpad on the Siri Remote, or just ask Siri to launch the apps for you. But I\u2019m very meh on the design. SUSIE OCHS\nThose aren\u2019t MY top movies!\u00a0 I want to be able to control what goes on the top row, which right now is too promotional, pushing \u201cTop Movies\u201d and TV shows that I have zero interest in. Apple should make that work more like the proactive Spotlight screen in iOS 9, either assuming I\u2019m here to pick up where I left off, or guessing what I might like based on my preferences. Just lay off the hard sell a little, Apple. My three-year-old has a hard time believing that we can\u2019t actually\u00a0watch\u00a0five-sixths of the movie selections shown to us on our current Apple TV\u2019s home screen, and I\u2019m starting to think he has a point. UPDATE:\u00a0I wasn\u2019t as clear as I could have been\u2014and I was totally wrong. I meant I want to customize the Top Movies row, which Apple calls the \u201ctop shelf,\u201d not the first row of apps. In fact, according to\u00a0the developer documentation, if I put my favorite tvOS apps in the top row of apps, and then select one, the top shelf will change to show me content from the selected app. All I'd have to do is replace the iTunes icons in the top row, and the top shelf would stop trying to sell me iTunes content. Remote and Siri Now we\u2019re talking\u2014the Siri Remote makes voice search a piece of cake. You can hold down the button and ask for something to watch, whether you just want something funny, you\u2019re looking for a movie for your kid, you want to watch the New Girl episode Prince guest-starred on (which you should, it\u2019s hilarious), or you\u2019re just in the mood to gaze at Brad Pitt or Ryan Gosling (I feel you). SUSIE OCHS\nMulti-channel search supports iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Showtime at launch. This search should have found 30 Rock on Hulu too, unless this demo Apple TV wasn\u2019t signed into the Hulu app. In my demo time, voice searches were quick and accurate, just like on the Amazon Fire TV. Being able to search within results is huge. You can ask for kids movies, for example, and then specify just the animated ones, or just the ones with Robin Williams. Much handier than having to start the search over just because you want to tweak it a little. The Siri Remote is comfortable to hold, and should make a passable game controller thanks to its accelerometer and gyroscope, but the fact that Apple wants to charge $13 for a wrist strap to keep you from dropping it is obscene. (Then again, replacing the remote will run you $79, so maybe we should consider using Stickum like a bunch of NFL wide receivers in the 1970s.) SUSIE OCHS\nThe Siri Remote ditches the circular D-pad on the old version, and instead you swipe around on the glass touchpad area up top. Hold down the microphone button to talk to Siri\u2014the mic is embedded right in the remote.\u00a0 Searching brings up results for multiple services at the same time. Ask for\u00a0New Girl, and it\u2019ll show you what\u2019s on iTunes as well as Netflix and Hulu. (HBO is also supported, but they don\u2019t have\u00a0New Girl, of course.) Apple says it\u2019ll add more services over time, but those are a great start. Siri can even let you navigate once you\u2019re watching something. You can ask her to skip forward a minute\u2014Apple wouldn\u2019t tell me if that works to skip commercials in Hulu, but I doubt it. You can even ask, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d if you missed a line, and the playback will jump back 10 seconds and temporarily bump the volume so you can catch it on the replay. That\u2019s all very cool. Apps My demo included a peek at some games, like\u00a0Galaxy on Fire 3: Manticore Rising. They looked great, like console games, but I\u2019m not a console gamer and I don\u2019t get excited about stuff like background detail and bloom lighting. I saw a demo of Rayman Adventures played with just the Siri Remote (held sideways), as well as a stripped-down shooter called Fantastic Plastic that automatically shoots for you as you aim. SUSIE OCHS\nApps aren\u2019t labeled in the grid, which means we\u2019re relying on developers to make their icons instantly recognizable to everyone. (Good job, Netflix. Try again, games.) MFI game controllers are supported too, so you can play multiplayer with up to 4 people, and Game Center lets you play against people over the Internet. We weren\u2019t blown away by the Fire TV\u2019s similar approach to gaming, but Apple has greater developer support, so maybe it can succeed where the Fire TV fizzled. Neither the Gilt app nor the Zillow app convinced me that shopping from your TV is going to Be A Thing, but that\u2019s just a personal preference. At least with the new Apple TV\u2019s App Store approach, you won\u2019t see apps you don\u2019t want. The new MLB app looks cool, taking advantage of your TV\u2019s big screen to show you multiple live games at once. Ports The new Apple TV looks just like the old Apple TV (which is still for sale for $69), only it\u2019s about half an inch taller. But even with more surface area to work with, Apple ditched the optical audio-out port on the old version. Now the only way you can get sound out of your Apple TV is with HDMI. APPLE\nNo optical-out port is hugely disappointing to me, but others might not care as much. The USB-C port isn\u2019t for you; it\u2019s just for service and support. And that really stinks. My current Apple TV\u2014used daily\u2014is connected to my TV with HDMI, as well as my stereo receiver with an optical audio cable. That way, if I\u2019m just watching TV that will sound good enough on my TV\u2019s speakers, I can leave the stereo off. But if I am watching Top Gun or something, I can mute the TV, flip on the stereo, and enjoy Tom Cruise\u2019s antics in surround sound. I like having the option. I also enjoy sending music from my iPhone, iPad, and Mac to my stereo via AirPlay on the Apple TV, and my television can stay off. Sure, newer receivers have HDMI or even AirPlay built in, or I could use an AirPort Express to AirPlay music to the stereo, but it bums me out that Apple didn\u2019t think it necessary to let users select different audio outputs for different use cases. Still, the new Siri Remote and the multi-channel search are huge steps in the right direction, and I\u2019m looking forward to thoroughly testing the new Apple TV when it ships in October.", "source": "think-act-do"}
