Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, the Wall Street executive said, are \u201cwacky.\u201d And the image of Mr. Trump \u201cwith his finger on the button blows my mind,\u201d he added, drawing laughter from the audience.\nYet his candidacy may signal voters are ready to support politicians who are willing to compromise and \u201cget the best deal for my set of positions.\u201d\n\u201cNobody who listens to him thinks he\u2019s ideologically stuck on the most extreme position,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said of Mr. Trump.\nAn avid reader of history, Mr. Blankfein went back to the early 1800s when an unconventional candidate named Andrew Jackson won the presidency.\n\u201cWhat must people have been thinking when he got elected?\u201d he said of Jackson, an \u201cunkempt and noisy\u201d populist from the woods who ended the line of establishment candidates in the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cCould that be happening now?\n\u201cWe\u2019re being kind of dismissive of things. But people must\u2019ve dismissed that.\u201d\nWhen asked if he could live with Mr. Trump in the White House, Mr. Blankfein demurred: \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d", "source": "EconomicPolicyJournal.com"}
