Mr. Oloketuyi has been surprisingly sent to the Special Fraud Unit of the Police for defamation for publishing damning details of an alleged affair of Mr. Nnamdi Okonkwo with an employee of the bank he heads.\n\nOkonkwo has just thrown a bone to many dogs as he may be able to get Oloketuyi, perhaps, out of circulation for a while but his story is going to attract quite a lot of attention.\u00a0 Despite my lack of legal knowledge, et cetera, I wonder how this case is going to be handled if the defendant's attorney that may be more as the case progresses through the different court levels is/are able to prove an \"ambush\" that the present attorney, Muiz Banire, the legal adviser of the All Progress Congress, APC holds to be the lot of his client.\n\nTOLA.\n\n \n\nFOLLOW THE Premium Times STORY:\nhttp://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/189398-nigerian-blogger-accused-of-defaming-fidelity-bank-md-gets-bail.html\n\nTHURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2015. 2:35 p.m. [GMT]", "source": "emotanafricana.com"}
