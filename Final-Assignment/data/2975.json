As of this writing, Coleen\u2019s movie opposite Derek Ramsay has earned more than P100 million which puts her among the ranks of other box office actresses like Toni Gonzaga, Kathryn Bernardo, Angelica Panganiban and Bea Alonzo, among others. Coleen is currently busy with the second book of her afternoon top-rating soap Pasion de Amor. On top of this, Star Cinema executives also revealed that she will part of a new film come 2016 which will have her acting opposite two leading men, who are yet to be named. Due to all these things, Coleen related during the recently-concluded thanksgiving blogger\u2019s conference of her movie, that she rarely gets to go to It\u2019s Showtime. Of late, the noontime variety show has been spearheading the search for a partner for Angelica Jane Yap aka \u201cPastillas Girl.\u201d On the show\u2019s Thursday episode, Pastillas Girl turned emotional over the bashing that she has been getting ever since she appeared on the noontime show. \u201cAlthough I went kanina, that\u2019s the first time to experience the whole Pastillas Girl thing. And you know she seems like a genuine person. She spoke from the heart earlier. Pero she talked about how she feels about everything. Umiyak pa siya and everything,\u201d said Coleen. To the naysayers of the segment, Coleen stressed that, \u201cYou know none of it is scripted. What I think is if you start to disregard the entire competition between the networks, you start to see that this girl is really special. She has something to offer naman to people. She deserves where she is now.\u201d Seeing that like her, Pastillas Girl, also received a lot of judgment without really hearing her side yet, Coleen offered some advice. \u201cMas mahirap sa kanya kasi hindi siya artista. So parang wala pa siyang nararamdaman na good feelings about being here sa showbiz eh bina-bash na siya,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAng advice ko sa kanya eh kapit lang, kapit lang sa Diyos kasi God is really the only one who can get you through everything.\u201d Coleen Garcia has advice for Pastillas Girl about bashers Continue to source: Push.com.ph (article and image source) or browse other latest showbiz news articles!
