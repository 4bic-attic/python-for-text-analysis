August's pace was also up 21.6% from a year ago. By region, Northeast sales of 36K rose from 29K, Midwest to 60K vs. 66K, South 319K from 297K, and West 137K vs. 130K. Despite the strong August results, homebuilders remain lower alongside the broader market. Leading the way lower is KB Home (KBH -3.4% ) which reported an earnings beat this morning, but rising land costs did eat into profit margins.
