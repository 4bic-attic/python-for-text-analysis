She is seen as having undermined the U.S. Bishops\u2019 concern over Obamacare\u2019s abortion component when the controversial health care takeover was being debated five-and-a-half years ago. \n \nHer Network organization, widely regarded as having radical feminist leanings, was investigated by the Vatican over the group\u2019s refusal to observe Catholic teaching on abortion, human sexuality and women\u2019s ordination. The investigation concluded earlier this year, resulting in minimal repercussions for the group. \n \nRobinson, who \u201cdivorced\u201d his homosexual partner last year, and is a senior fellow for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress , has been invited to religious events in the past by Obama, leading a prayer at the president\u2019s 2009 inauguration and taking part in the 2014 National Prayer Breakfast. \n \nAlso invited are Mateo Williamson, a biological woman who identifies as a man and a former co-chair of the Transgender Caucus for the pro-homosexual activist  group Dignity USA; and Aaron Ledesma, author of the blog \u201cThe Gay Catholic.\u201d \n \nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!  \n \nThe i nvitation organizer for the White House papal event is Vivian Taylor, executive director of the national LGBT advocacy arm of the Episcopal Church, and a biological male. \n \nThe unease caused by the guest list demonstrates Catholic concerns, including that of many bishops, the WSJ report said, that the Obama administration is using Pope Francis\u2019s visit to underplay its differences with the Church on controversial issues such as homosexual \u201cmarriage,\u201d abortion and the Obamacare contraception Mandate. \n \nU.S. Vatican Ambassador Ken Hackett , named\u00a0 by Obama\u00a0 to his post in June 2014, said last month that Pope Francis and Obama are not going to waste time discussing any differences they may have. Rather, they will choose to focus on issues where they see eye-to-eye. \n \nAccording to Hackett these areas are poverty, religious freedom, concern for persecuted Christians and minorities, and peace. \n \n\u201cThen climate, of course,\u201d Hackett said. \n \n\u201cWe agree to differ on things like gay marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut really there are not a lot of other such issues.\u201d \n \nPope Francis will visit the U.S for the first time September 22-27. In addition to visiting the White House, he will address a joint session of the U.S. Congress and the U.N. General Assembly, before appearing at the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia.", "source": "LifeSite"}
