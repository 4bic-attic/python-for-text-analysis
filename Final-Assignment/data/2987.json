He looks a very sharp player.\" \n \nGoalkeeper David de Gea has also been in fine form after signing a new contract while Smalling and Daley Blind have formed a solid central defensive pairing and Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger have added experience and craft to the midfield. \n \nAIM HIGHER \n \n\"We have improved,\" Smalling said. \"Last season\u2019s start was disastrous and it didn't give us a foothold to be able to challenge for anything. \n \n\"We know we have improved in this section of the season and we now have to improve in each other section compared to last season and aim a lot higher.\" \n \nWounded Wolfsburg, who drew 1-1 with Hanover 96 on Saturday after being crushed 5-1 by Bayern Munich last week, are likely to be without midfielders Luiz Gustavo and Vieirinha. \n \nBrazil international Luiz Gustavo was taken off midway through their demolition at Bayern with a knee injury and coach Dieter Hecking says his chances of playing in Manchester \"don't look good\". \n \nPortuguese Vieirinha has returned to training after a three-week break caused by a thigh injury but the game at Old Trafford could come too soon for him. \n \nThe Wolves, who won their opener against CSKA Moscow, are looking to take control of the group. \n \n\"We have worked very hard to get here and experience games like the one at Manchester United,\" said captain Diego Benaglio. \"So we want to look really good there and we are certainly not going to England just to look at the stadium.\" \n \n(Writing by Karolos Grohmann, additional reporting by Ed Osmond, editing by Tony Jimenez)", "source": "Yahoo!
