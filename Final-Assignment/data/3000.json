A western Sydney lawyer has been banned from practising after he falsely invoiced Legal Aid NSW for more than $30,000.\n\nSonny Wilson, a Liverpool solicitor, charged Legal Aid for barristers' and translators' fees on behalf of his clients when no such work was provided. \n\n\ufeff \n\nBetween 2012 and 2013, he misappropriated trust funds and made five false certifications to the service, which has struggled with federal funding cuts. Several times Mr Wilson told Legal Aid that barristers had appeared in court when Wilson himself represented his clients.\n\nOn Monday, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal found Wilson guilty of \"egregious\" dishonesty.

He is now studying full-time for a three-year degree in theology at Alphacrucis College in Parramatta.\n\nThe tribunal's decision came one year after to legal aid services around Australia.
