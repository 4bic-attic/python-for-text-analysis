Bloggers are the new celebrities, and because of the weight and depth of the authentic connection they\u2019ve built with fans, they may be even more authoritative than the big names. \u00a0 Your key influencers\u00a0can be found\u00a0in the \u201cMagic Middle\u201d \u2013 not YouTube superstars, but not Twitter eggheads either.

Engage your Superfans  \nSuperfans will be easy to find \u2013 they\u2019re the ones talking to you about how great you are.\u00a0 \n  \nSuper fans are not only those with huge communities, but those who are literally super fans of the brand #traackruk  pic.twitter.com/8ptxxAacXj \n \n\u2014 Luke Freeman (@lukie3man) September 22, 2015 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nDon\u2019t just bask in your superfans\u2019\u00a0praise \u2013 engage them and turn them into genuine advocates for your business. This could mean wooing them with gifts, sneak peeks at new products, or asking them to create content for you. \n 3. Remember you\u2019re writing a love story  \nBuilding an influencer relationship takes time and investment. From that point of view alone, a one-off campaign doesn\u2019t make sense. Instead, capitalise on your relationship by involving your influencer in content creation, and working with them on an on-going basis\u00a0\u00a0 \n  \n\u201cInfluencer marketing is a long-term relationship, not a one night stand\u201d #TraackrUK  pic.twitter.com/uPDIIUe4nM \n \n\u2014 Mike Tinmouth (@michaeltinmouth) September 22, 2015 \n \n\n 4.\u00a0Never underestimate the value of meeting IRL  \nA coffee is worth a thousand emails. Getting together with your influencers \u2013 in your office (so exciting for a super-fan!), or by organising an event for them to connect to other fans \u2013 can go a long way.  \n \nThe dirty secret of online communities is meeting in real life.

Consider paying your influencers  \nThe Traackr panel: Johanna Whitaker, Andrew Grill and Garth Farrar discuss influencer relations. \n \nOne of the most contentious points of the Traackr event was whether or not influencers should be paid.\u00a0  Does paying your influencers undermine their authenticity? Does paying an influencer turn them into just another advertiser \u2013 but one you have less control over?  \n \n. @farrargarth Don\u2019t confuse the term \u201cinfluencer\u201d with \u201ccelebrity\u201d where you\u2019re basically paying for reach #traackruk \u2014 Alistair Wheate (@alistairtweet) September 22, 2015 \n \nIn an ideal world, influencers would be super-fans, genuinely engaged with the brand and overjoyed to work for free. However, like all relationships, the relationships you have with your influencers have to be reciprocal, a true partnership which benefits both parties. Whether that\u2019s rewarding your influencers with money-can\u2019t-buy experiences, producing high-quality content for them to share, or cold, hard cash, ensuring the relationship is reciprocal will help it last into the long term. \n \nTier influencers & reward the relationship appropriately. Time is the best reward & give it appropriately #InfluencerMarketing  #TraackUuk \u2014 Sarah Price (@_sgprice) September 22, 2015 \n \nNeed help nurturing your influencer relations?
