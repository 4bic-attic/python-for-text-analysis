I am the only person who can issue out the presidential form to candidates, with the parliamentary, candidates can go to their constituency secretary for the form. I was told yesterday [Monday] that George Boateng has visited the party office for the form\u2026but I told my clerks to hold on because I am not at the office,\u201d - the General said \n\nGeorge Boateng who maintained he has picked his form was unable to show \u2018clearly\u2019 the real presidential nomination form since the only picture evidence was him with an elderly person handling over a \u2018brown envelope\u2019 to him [George] in an office. \n\nHowever, the presidential aspirant has now revealed the \u2018real\u2019 form with the party\u2019s logo [Umbrella] boldly embossed in it. \n\nWould Asiedu Nketiah still deny the authenticity of the form from the man he described as \u2013 \u201cmentally disabled\u201d?", "source": "Peace FM"}
