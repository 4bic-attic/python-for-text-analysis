Five key questions", "id": "d99ab8d5-7a54-4ebe-a3d1-cbbd479c2143", "content": "Is Brendan Rodgers in genuine trouble?  \nCertainly in the eyes of Liverpool supporters, if not the owners, who resisted calls to sack the manager at the end of last season, overlooked the claims of an out-of-work Bundesliga winner and backed Rodgers with another overhaul of the playing staff plus his backroom team in the summer. Since 22 March, when Liverpool hosted Manchester United at Anfield with designs on qualifying for the Champions League at the expense of Louis van Gaal\u2019s team, only to lose 2-1 and collectively nosedive, their record reads: played 18, won five, drawn five and lost eight. Those five victories have come against Newcastle , QPR, Stoke City and Bournemouth in the Premier League , and Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup. By any stretch it is a record that invites pressure on a manager. At a club with Liverpool\u2019s ambitions it is nowhere near good enough. \n Are Liverpool\u2019s ambitions unrealistic given the financial might of other Premier League clubs?  \nNo, and how can 18-times league champions and five-times European champions lose ambition? Much was made last season of Liverpool having the fifth-highest wage bill in the Premier League and how that provided an accurate gauge of \u201cwhere we are at\u201d \u2013 to quote Rodgers himself. Given how few teams have broken the wage bill/league position balance in the Premier League , it must be taken into consideration. Other investment figures, however, scream underachievement to Fenway Sports Group . Analysis by the Football Observatory in Switzerland published after the close of the last transfer windowlisted the most expensively assembled squads in Europe\u2019s so-called\u2018Big Five\u2019 leagues: Germany , Spain , Italy , England and France . Liverpool were seventh with their squad costing \u00a3251m. Barcelona were sixth with \u00a3287m (due in part to the \u00a375m given to Liverpool for Luis Su\u00e1rez) and Bayern Munich eighth on \u00a3246m. FSG has backed its transfer committee and manager but the return has been underwhelming; the cost of losing key players high. \n Has Rodgers run out of ideas at Liverpool ?  \nThe Liverpool manager is not short of ideas. In fact he has tried various formations this season in an attempt to rediscover the \u201cidentity\u201d he concedes has been lost. It was lost at the start of last season too. Ideas are not an issue for Rodgers. It is how far he and his team have departed from the principles that underpinned 2014\u2019s title challenge that is a greater problem for the manager, although he would dispute that he has veered away from aggressive pressing, penetrating football ideals. Other, weightier concerns than a lack of ideas would be the high turnover of players that has fixed Liverpool into a transitional phase and left their manager appealing for time for a second consecutive season. There is also no escaping the brutal truth that, four seasons into his Anfield reign, Rodgers is not presiding over an outstanding squad, one that has lost its captain ( Steven Gerrard ), best player (Su\u00e1rez) and brightest young talent ( Raheem Sterling ) in just over a year. Given he is not solely responsible for the construction of that squad, he is not solely to blame. \n Can the manager turn it around?  \nLast season\u2019s mid-term recovery \u2013 when Liverpool embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run in the Premier League after losing 3-0 at Manchester United \u2013 demonstrates Rodgers can steer a recovery but it appears an onerous task at present. The most damning verdict of Liverpool\u2019s 1-1 draw at home to Norwich City on Sunday arrived from the manager himself, when he admitted the anxiety that afflicted the team at Anfield upon his arrival from Swansea City in 2012 had returned. All that work, money and upheaval and Rodgers is back at square one. It may not sit comfortably after Sunday\u2019s Premier League poor result but there was encouragement for Liverpool in their performance against Norwich compared with previous outings. Striker Danny Ings suited Rodgers\u2019 system far better than the often isolated figure of Christian Benteke ; Daniel Sturridge\u2019s menace will only increase with fitness; and the recalled defenders Mamadou Sakho and Alberto Moreno made assured returns to the starting lineup. \n \nThere was also greater creativity, if not penetration, from a team who have failed to score more than one goal in 18 of the past 20 games. Small acorns and all that, but we are only six league games in. \n How have the new signings bedded in?  \nNot well enough to alleviate the pressure on their manager. Nathaniel Clyne has made a smooth transition from Southampton at right-back and young Joe Gomez was an unexpected bonus as a makeshift left-back in the opening games. Christian Benteke has shown flashes of talent but Liverpool\u2019s approach at the start of the season has merely supported Tim Sherwood\u2019s argument that the Belgium forward was not leaving Aston Villa for a team that played to his strengths. Ings has had little opportunity to impress but, as mentioned, seized it against Norwich ; \u00a329m Roberto Firmino is yet to make an impact but requires time \u2013 as all do in fairness;and James Milner\u2019s rapid elevation to the captaincy in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson reflects Rodgers\u2019 trust in the midfielder but also the lack of leaders available to the Liverpool manager before Milner\u2019s arrival from Manchester City. \n\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2015 theguardian.com.
