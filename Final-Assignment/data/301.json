The uptrend unfolded in 5 waves and the subsequent set back occurred in 3 waves.  \n\n\n Therefore, we have an Elliott Wave picture that suggests the higher probability move is for at least one more 5 wave move higher towards 1190.  \n\n\n Given the location in the larger wave picture and Gold forecast, it appears we are embarking upon a larger \u2018C\u2019 wave higher that could even test levels above 1300 (see HERE ).  \n\n\n As a result, we have a good opportunity at a good risk to reward ratio trade. Use the September 2015 low just below 1100 as the stop loss and initially targeting $1245 where this suggested wave \u2018iii\u2019 would be 1.618 * wave \u2018i\u2019.  \n\n\n If we make it up to 1170, we will look to move our stop loss to break even. Further appreciation above $1200 will allow us to add to the position as it will build the case for a wave iii higher.  \n\n\n Suggested Reading:  \n\n\n Gold Signaling Fed Disappointment?  \n\n\n Gold Price: Vigorous Bounce Off Trend Line Support  \n\n\n To receive additional picks or articles on using Elliott Wave Theory, join Jeremy\u2019s distribution list.  \n\n\n \noriginal source \nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets. \nLearn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM .", "source": "Yahoo!
