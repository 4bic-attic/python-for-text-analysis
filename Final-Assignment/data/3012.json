Jose could have just left it, let it go. But he couldn\u2019t. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s a bit like a boxer who has done everything but feels he just has to get back in the ring again. He just can\u2019t be happy with himself, for some reason, even though what he does is brilliant.\u201d", "source": "Star Plus Ireland"}
