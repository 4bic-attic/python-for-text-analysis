They held up signs opposing Trump, American flags and Donald Trump pi\u00f1atas while some yelled \"Stop the hate,\" and \"Si se puede.\" \n\nDomingo Garcia, attorney and president of League of United Latin American Citizens in Dallas, helped organize the protest to send a message to Donald Trump and the Republican Party. \n \n\u201cMessages of hate, intolerance and bigotry are not welcome in Dallas, Texas,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe believe in the values that are enshrined on the Statue of Liberty and our bill of rights: Inclusion, tolerance and being a country of immigrants.\u201d \n\nPublic Relations senior Christopher Enriquez said the U.S. immigration system is broken, and Trump\u2019s plan to deport 11 million immigrants is impractical. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying we are not going to be silenced,\u201d he said. \"They ask the people to go back to Mexico, or their country of origin. People can't just leave what they've built for years just to go back and apply and maybe come back 10 years later.\" \n\nDianne Bellard, Trump rally attendee, said Trump is just saying what everyone\u2019s thinking. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s for immigration, but just not illegal. I love the fact of immigration but I don\u2019t love the fact of just walking across and taking our money,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \n\nShe said she supports Trump building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and thinks welfare should be cut to help fund it. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to do some welfare cuts, but I\u2019m tired of seeing all the people go out with their bling-bling nails and their tattoos and trading their EBT cards for money so they can buy drugs, and TVs and cowboy gear, you name it,\u201d she said. \n\nNursing sophomore Tobias Gaucin found out about the protest on Facebook. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal. He\u2019s talking about my family. My parents came here to have a better life,\u201d he said. \u201cFor him to call them murderers and rapists and drug dealers, that\u2019s just not right.\u201d \n \nVictor Ibarra, a Mexican immigrant, has been in the U.S. for more than 20 years, and is currently going through the process to become a resident, he said. \n\n\u201cIt makes me feel like an animal,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like garbage. The testimony that Trump says is that we are bad people. I have never been to jail. I'm not a criminal. I've never been in drugs. He\u2019s making a racial profile with the Mexican community.\u201d \n\nAndrew Rokovich, is the owner and operator of Double Dave\u2019s Pizza Works in Victoria, TX and the president of Texas Young Republican\u2019s Federation in Victoria. He said he\u2019s never supported a candidate as much as he supports Trump. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer in borders, language and culture, and obviously that\u2019s kind of his pillars,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think he\u2019s going to strengthen our culture.\u201d \n\n@kathryncargo \n\n@dbradley122", "source": "Shorthorn"}
