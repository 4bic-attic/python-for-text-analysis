On the contrary, electric scooters become more and more popular in the market. Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter is designed in the transcendent principle of innovation and aesthetics, which is featured by portability and eco-friendliness.\n\nAs to common people, cars are not the optimum transport anymore. They tend to run after small and portable transports such as electric self-balancing scooters. Designed in the transcendent concept of portability and eco-friendliness, Airwheel intelligent scooter, the best brand within the industry, serves as a great transport for users to travel around as well as make contribution to environmental protection.\n\nAirwheelself-balancing scooter is so small that it can be easily put in the backpack. For example, Airwheel A3, the latest model by Airwheel, only takes up 0.25 square meters. Thus, users are able to go through streets and roads with only one wheel without suffering terrible traffic jams. Besides, mounted with top-quality Cheng Shin tires, Airwheel intelligent scooter can go across whatever terrains it may encounter. Moreover, as it is equipped with high-tech intelligent chip, it achieves self-balancing via gravity center change.\n\nUnder the steering principle of Airwheel intelligent scooter, riders can steer the vehicle and control the speed via simple body movements. If riders want to march forward, they have to lean forward; when they want to stop the vehicle, they have to lean backward. In order to provide protection for riders, the transport is designed with special settings. In the event that the real-time speed of the transport hits the restricted one, the vehicle will ring an alarm to tell the riders to slow down for the sake of safety. Apart from that, Airwheel intelligent scooter is also quite environmentally friendly. Based on the latest energy-saving technology, it is powered by electricity rather than gas, thus emitting no exhaust or generating no noise. As a result, it leaves little pressure on the environment. If it is universally applied in the common transportation, it will surely reduce the usage of cars and contribute to environmental protection.\n\nBy virtue of its great portability and eco-friendliness, Airwheel electric scooter is regarded as the best modern model for transport.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany Name: Airwheel Technology Holding (USA) Co., Ltd.\n\nContact Person: Mr. Tang\n\nEmail: business@airwheel.net\n\nPhone: +8618861270200\n\nCity: LA\n\nState: CA\n\nCountry: United States\n\nWebsite: http://www.airwheel.net/\n\nSource: ABNewswire", "source": "Review Seeker"}
