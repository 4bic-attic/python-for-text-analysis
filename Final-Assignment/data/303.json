Last Saturday\u2019s Notre Dame/Virginia college football game drew a 3.7 final rating and 5.7 million viewers on ABC, down 10% in ratings and 12% in viewership from USC/Stanford last year (4.1, 6.5M) but up 37% and 38%, respectively, from regional coverage in 2013 (2.7, 4.2M). Though down from last year, Notre Dame\u2019s comeback win ranked second for the weekend among college football games \u2014 trailing only Oregon/Michigan State later in the night. As previously reported, that game had a 4.8 and 7.9 million. Head-to-head, Notre Dame/Virginia more-than-doubled both Georgia/Vanderbilt on CBS (1.7, 2.6M) and Iowa/Iowa State on FOX (1.1, 1.8M). Earlier in the afternoon, Oregon State/Michigan drew 4.5 million viewers \u2014 up 41% from regional action last year (3.2M). The rating was not immediately available. The Wolverines\u2019 blowout win ranked third for the weekend. (Wknd. numbers from ESPN, Sports Business Daily)", "source": "Sports Media Watch"}
