The program works to provide services to the most vulnerable in our communities, and to create jobs through the expansion and retention of businesses. CDBG is an important tool for helping local governments tackle serious challenges facing their communities. \n \nThe CDBG program has spanned from Thomaston Mill to East Griffin. The North Griffin investment has totaled approximately $5.4 million with $3.5 million from CDBG funding. Those investment dollars have helped replace or rehabilitate 7.1 miles of water mains, 2.3 miles of sewer lines, 53 sewer manholes, install 42 new fire hydrants and renew 497 water service lines. \n \nThe City has been very fortunate to have been awarded seven (7) Community Development Block Grants totaling $3.5 million to address infrastructure improvements. The City applied for the 2015 CDBG funding for the final phase of water and sewer infrastructure for this area. We are proud to have been awarded the CDBG to complete the work started in 2008 addressing poor infrastructure conditions in the North Griffin area. City representatives will attend the awards workshop, September 9 \u2013 11, to accept the \u201cBIG CHECK\u201d.", "source": "WKEU Radio"}
