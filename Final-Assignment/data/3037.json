REALTOR\u00c2\u00ae Safe Harbor is a web-based site and mobile-friendly app that enables agents to quickly determine safe locations to meet.\nSeveral REALTOR\u00c2\u00ae associations have recently signed on to be among the first groups to take part in the program, including the Arkansas REALTOR\u00c2\u00aes Association, 6,923 members; the Wyoming Association of REALTOR\u00c2\u00aes, 2,012 members; the Louisiana REALTOR\u00c2\u00aes Association, 11,650 members; and the Idaho Association of REALTOR\u00c2\u00aes, 7,000 members. Several other state associations are also close to finalizing partnerships with REALTOR\u00c2\u00ae Safe Harbor.\nAll of the associations and Real Agent Guard are actively encouraging real estate firms and other businesses to offer their locations as a safe harbor.\nReal Agent Guard, based in Rogers, Ark., is a mobile-enabled personal security service that provides real-time monitoring of employees or agents for the purpose of providing both monitoring and deterrence from potential personal attacks. 0saves Save If you enjoyed this post, please consider leaving a comment or subscribing to the RSS feed to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.", "source": "Financial News"}
