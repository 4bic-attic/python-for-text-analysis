Unruly delegates brought the conference to an halt. \n\r \n\u201cEvery time we approach the conference they impound our taxis, which would lead to chaos and people would blame Nxumalo. It\u2019s clear that we are being used, that was one reason why we aborted the strike,\u2019\u2019 he said. \n\r \nThe strike was called off on Thursday after the taxi industry, provincial government and city reached an agreement to release impounded taxis to owners who paid a R1 500  fine \n\r \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have tangible evidence, but we are confident we are being used to cause chaos in the city. The people behind this operation know we will strike. Their aim is to make the city ungovernable under the current leadership building up to the conference,\u201d said Mhlongo. \n\r \nThe conference to elect the region\u2019s chairperson has been marred by nullifications, postponements and cancellations. At stake is the city\u2019s close to R40 billion budget. \n\r \nBheki Mbambo, deputy chair of the SA Taxi Council in KwaZulu-Natal, said they would fight against being used by politicians for political gain. \u201cWe want to remain as independent business people. We don\u2019t want to be involved in politics because we are not politicians,\u201d said Mbambo. \n\r \nHe said the long-standing unresolved issues between the taxi industry, Metro police and the Department of Transport must be resolved: \u201cThe department must get its house in order. They must process applications for permits in time, and there will be peace in the province.\u201d \n\r \nSecretary of the ANC in KZN, Sihle Zikalala, who is believed to be backing Gumede, brushed off the claims, saying he would not like to comment on this matter because these were \u201cbaseless\u201d allegations. \n\r \n\u201cWe will not like to give credence to things that are baseless,\u201d said Zikalala. \n\r \nGumede expressed shock at the allegations. \u201cAll I know is that the strike was caused by the issue of permits. But I\u2019m used to people who go around tarnishing my image and it doesn\u2019t worry me any more,\u201d she said. \n\r \nNxumalo, who is said to enjoy the support of premier Senzo Mchunu, could not be reached for comment. \n\r \n[email\u00a0protected] \n\r \nSunday Independent", "source": "IOL"}
