Every Monday neighbors from near and far congregate at the corner of Hudson and Greenwood Avenue to grocery shop for fresh produce and baked goods, utilize the free health services, or to enjoy Bingo outside with friends and new acquaintances. The music provided by various DJs welcomes people passing by on the street to come in and gives the market a comfortable feeling that encourages patrons to stay a while, try a free sample from the Rutgers Cooperative Extension healthy food demonstrations, and take a seat at one of the picnic tables to get a bit of shade from the sunny afternoon.\n\n \n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4576\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"] Healthy demonstration samples from Rutgers Cooperative Extension[/caption]\nEvery week we are inspired by the reoccurring friendly faces at the market. We are encouraged by the communities appreciative response to not only the available fresh fruits, vegetables, baked goods, meat, eggs, and flowers, but also the health services that are provided. The community has been served well by the free blood pressure screenings, glucose screenings, BMIs, vision & glaucoma screenings, nutritional consulting, pharmaceutical consulting, and other services that rotate weekly. We look forward to what the next couple of cooler months have in store for the market.\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4577\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"] Visit from Angela Tagtow, Executive Director of the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) and New Jersey Department of Agriculture Secretary Douglas Fisher[/caption]", "source": "ShapingNJ Community Pilots"}
