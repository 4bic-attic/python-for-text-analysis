Geoff Patton \u2014 Montgomery Media \n LANSDALE >> It just might be the biggest stage Mater Dei Catholic School music teacher Jason Strefeler, of Bensalem, sets foot on. \nBefore millions of people, and accompanied by the Philadelphia Orchestra, he and 249 other singers will lift their voices in what is sure to be a performance they\u2019ll never forget. \n\nStrefeler has been selected to be a member of the Papal Choir set to perform during Pope Francis\u2019 visit to Philadelphia at the conclusion of the World Meeting of Families conference in Philadelphia Sept. 22 to 27. \n\nThe choir will perform during the Papal Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway Sept. 27 at 4 p.m. where conference officials have estimated 1.5 million people to be in attendance. \n\n\u201cI have heard so many stories from people attending the Mass the last time a Pope was here in the 1970s and how you could hear a pen drop during his address \u2014 it was so quiet,\u201d Strefeler said Thursday, referring to Pope John Paul II\u2019s visit to Philadelphia in 1979. \u201cTo see such a big crowd assembled, in the name of Catholicism, will be a holy experience \u2014 a unique experience.\u201d \n\nThe 27-year-old music teacher, auditioned for the choir the last day try-outs were held at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia in the middle of the summer. He described the audition as challenging and one that really made him think about the notes he was singing with his baritone voice. \n\nAfter learning via email that he was selected to sing at the Papal Mass in mid-July, he said he was excited. Not only would he have a good chance to see the pope, but he was going to use a skill he said he is proud of \u2014 his voice \u2014 to honor him. \n\n\u201cPope Francis relates to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the way a Catholic should be, in my eyes. He\u2019s out there, he\u2019s meeting with people and he\u2019s carrying on a lot of service to those around him.  He exemplifies and shows what it means to live the faith \u2014 he doesn\u2019t expect anything in return.\u201d \n\nThe choir has met twice thus far and will be practicing every other Monday until the week of the performance, he said. The week of the WMOF, Strefeler said that they\u2019ll have three practices before the Papal Mass. During the practices, the choir has worked on pieces by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and songs specially composed for the event, he said. \n\nA children\u2019s choir, as well as high school, Spanish, Vietnamese and African-American choirs are also slated to take the stage, he said.
