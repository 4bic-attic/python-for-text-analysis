Contractors working for Georgia Power on the new ferry shelter landing on Rousakis Plaza found an intact jug buried six feet down in their construction site. The jug was handed over to the City\u2019s Research Library & Municipal Archives department, which will be working with local experts to determine when the jug was made and what purpose it might have served. \n\nBased on the location, City staff thinks the jug might date back to when the port of Savannah was located along River Street, and it could\u2019ve been an item that was imported or exported through the port. Inside the jug is a dark, oily substance that smells fishy, so perhaps it stored fish oil.\u00a0 The jug appears to feature a salt glaze and exhibits throw marks around the neck and base.\u00a0 There are no visible potter\u2019s marks. \n \n\u00a9 2015, Hearst Stations Inc. on behalf of WJCL-TV.", "source": "WJCL ABC 22"}
