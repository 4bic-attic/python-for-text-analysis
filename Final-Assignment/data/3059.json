But that\u2019s not stopping Kenny Chesney and Miranda Lambert from gearing up for the hottest ticket of next summer. \n\nFresh off his record-breaking Big Revival Tour, Chesney announced on Tuesday a brand new summer 2016 tour with Lambert on tap to join the stadium shows. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the country superstars have joined forces on stage. Lambert opened for Chesney back in 2009 and in June of this year, she made a guest appearance singing \u201cYou and Tequila\u201d during Chesney\u2019s tour stop in Chicago. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got so much soul and grit, heart and the ability to get to the core of a song,\u201d Chesney exclusively told ETonline. \u201cThinking about what song would make sense, well, she\u2019s the kinda woman who understands that complicated feeling of waiting for something that\u2019s not good for you, but feels so good.\u201d \n\nAt the time, Chesney kept mum about a potential in-studio collaboration with Lambert \u2014 but clearly those creative juices were flowing! \n\n\u201cMiranda is the real deal,\u201d Chesney said in a press release on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s a songwriter, first, and a real vocalist. She\u2019s puts it all out there when she\u2019s on stage, and I loved touring with her so much in 2009, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken us this long to get her back out here \u2013 because I love every single thing about who she is as an artist and a person.\u201d \n\nSpecific tour dates have not yet been announced, but we do know that Chesney has tapped Sam Hunt and Old Dominion to serve as the opening acts. Both artists had previously penned hits for Chesney, including \u201cCome Over\u201d and \u201cSave It For A Rainy Day,\u201d respectively. \n\n\u201cThe second I heard Sam\u2019s demo for \u2018Come Over,\u2019 I knew he was onto something very unique,\u201d Chesney, who gave Hunt his first cut, said. \u201cWatching him develop as an artist, seeing his songwriting evolve \u2013 and knowing how he brings it when he gets onstage makes him a perfect act to come out with us. He\u2019s fun, alive and all about the music.\u201d \n\nFans who saw Chesney\u2019s Big Revival Tour this summer should already be familiar with Old Dominion (\u201cBreak Up With Him\u201d), who will kick off this next tour with a longer set. Their debut LP, Meat and Candy, is out Nov. 6. \n\nNo word on when we can expect new tunes from Chesney, but Lambert has been pouring herself into the creative process ever since news broke that she and Blake Shelton had divorced in July.
