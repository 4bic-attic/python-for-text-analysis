Part of a larger Phase 3 program of more than 3,000 RA patients at various points in the RA treatment continuum, RA-BEGIN enrolled nearly 600 patients who were randomized to one of the following treatment groups:\n\n\"The superiority of baricitinib over methotrexate in the treatment of patients with early RA adds to the positive data already seen for baricitinib in RA patients with inadequate responses to traditional DMARDs (RA-BUILD) and biological therapies (RA-BEACON),\" said Rich Levy \n\nIn RA-BEGIN, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, including serious infections, was similar across treatment groups. No cases of tuberculosis or gastrointestinal perforation were reported during the study. The most common adverse events observed were consistent with previous studies of baricitinib in RA. Discontinuations due to adverse events were more common in patients receiving the combination of baricitinib plus methotrexate. A large majority of patients completing RA-BEGIN opted to participate in a long-term extension study. \n\nLilly and Incyte announced top-line results in December 2014 \n\nAbout Baricitinib\n\nBaricitinib is a once-daily, oral, selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that JAK inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of a broad range of inflammatory conditions. Baricitinib demonstrates approximately 100-fold greater potency of inhibition against JAK1 and JAK2 than JAK 3 in kinase assays. \n\nIn December 2009 \n\nAbout Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease[i] \n\nAbout Baricitinib Phase 3 Trials\n\nLilly and Incyte are conducting four pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of baricitinib in patients with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis to support regulatory submission in most countries. An additional Phase 3 study was initiated to support clinical development in China \n\nAbout Incyte\n\nIncyte Corporation is a Wilmington, Delaware \n\nAbout Eli Lilly and Company\n\nLilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world.
