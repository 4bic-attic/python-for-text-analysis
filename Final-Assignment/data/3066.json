The Crow River runs through the park and it has tons of paths every which way, which I\u2019m pretty sure I have crossed over a few times. \n \n\n \nThe polypores were in full force! \n \n\n \nAnd some beautiful mushrooms. This one had a purple cast to it. \n \n\n \nIt\u2019s just a weed, but truly one the most beautiful weed with nice curls! \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFrom today\u2019s hike\u2026 \n \n\n \nAnd yesterday\u2019s dog walk\u2026all good!", "source": "amaryllis log"}
