Bring the one billion back home!\" \n \r \r \r \nIn an egregious scam that has exposed endemic corruption and highlighted the power of oligarch groups in the country of 3.5 million, $1 billion has disappeared from the banking system - roughly one eighth of Moldova's gross domestic output. \n \r \r \r \nThe fraud has caused a rapid depreciation in the national currency, the leu, stoking inflation and hurting living standards. \n \r \r \r \nIt has also tarnished the image of the pro-Europe ruling class for ordinary Moldovans, many of whom struggle by on a family income of about $300 a month, though many protesters carried pro-EU flags indicating they were not against the country's policy of European integration. \n \r \r \r \nProtesters, who directed much of their verbal fire at the country's super-wealthy oligarchs who control key sectors of the economy, threatened to stage a non-stop demonstration in central Chisinau until their demands were met.\n\u00a0 Continued...", "source": "Reuters Africa"}
