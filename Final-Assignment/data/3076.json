So it was helpful.\u201d \n \nTom Hardy plays both Ronnie and Reggie Kray, while Emily Browning portrays Reggie\u2019s wife Frances in Legend, which is based on John Pearson\u2019s book The Profession Of Violence: The Rise And Fall Of The Kray Twins. \n \nChristopher \u2013 who played the ninth incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC sci-fi series and has also appeared in films such as Thor: The Dark World, 28 Days Later and GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra \u2013 said he felt \u201cjealous\u201d of Tom\u2019s dual role. \n   Promoted stories   Christopher Eccleston, far right, with Tom Hardy and the cast of Legend at the London premiere (Jonathan Short/Invision) \n\u201cIt was a deeply humbling experience in stereo. 99% of my scenes were with Reggie, I had one scene with Ron and that was a revelation watching,\u201d he recalled. \n \n\u201cThat was really interesting because I\u2019d only met Tom as Reg, and then suddenly there was Ron and they were completely different. As I have twin brothers, that was interesting to see what an actor would do for one role and the other. I was jealous.\u201d \n \nThe Lancashire-born star admitted he did not do any research for his part. \n \n\u201cTo quote David Bowie, I threw my homework on the fire\u2026 I think there\u2019s a load of b*****ks spoken about research and things,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s make believe. I felt that Brian had written, and sent a very clear message to me about what he wanted, so I relied on what was in the script and what happened on the set.\u201d \n Christopher didn\u2019t do research for the role (Jonathan Brady/PA) \nChristopher, who also based Nipper on Shakespearean villain Malvolio from Twelth Night, continued: \u201cMe and Brian did have a conversation about what sort of dog Nipper Reed might be \u2013 I decided on a bloodhound, because according to Brian, a bloodhound will run until it dies. It will chase its prey until its heart bursts. \n \n\u201cAnd then, I threw in Malvolio from Twelfth Night because Nipper was absolutely puritanical, a man of the 50s, a man who did not want the 60s to happen, who did not want the Krays to have sex and fun. He was a man from the previous 10 or 20 years. \n \n\u201c(I did) no homework, just drugs with Brian Helgeland,\u201d he joked. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nLegend opens in UK cinemas on September 9.", "source": "Wirral Globe"}
