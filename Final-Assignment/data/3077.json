Simmons, Owen Wilson, Ed Helms, Terry Bradshaw and Ving Rhames in the comedy Bastards. The film, which marks the directorial debut of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, is about two brothers (Wilson and Helms) whose eccentric mother fabricates a story that their father died when they were young. When they find out the story is false, they make it their mission to find their real father. Related History Orders Craig Ferguson Show 'Join or Die' The Mrs. Reynolds role played by Close is a pivotal one in the film as she must be believable as a one-time wild party girl from the 1970s who slept around. She must also be believable as a woman with a big heart as the truth that comes out later is much more complicated. Both Simmons and Bradshaw (who plays himself) play potential father figures. The comedy, scripted by Justin Malen (Bad Teacher 2), is from Alcon, Warner Bros, and Montecito Picture Company. Alcon is providing financing and producing with Montecito Picture Company. Montecito\u2019s Ivan Reitman and Ali Bell will produce along with Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove of Alcon. Montecito\u2019s Tom Pollock will executive produce along with Chris Fenton and Chris Cowles. Warner Bros is releasing the picture. Close is repped by CAA.", "source": "Deadline"}
