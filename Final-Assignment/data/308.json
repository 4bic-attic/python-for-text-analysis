If the Centre is not ready to give financial aid, or it does not have the money, then we should be allowed to get it from where we are getting it (internationally),\u201d Omar told reporters after donating blood as part of his party\u2019s blood donation camp to mark the first anniversary of the floods here. \n \nOmar, who is working president of opposition National Conference (NC), said people of the state had suffered from both sides, as neither had the Centre given any package nor did it allow any international aid. \n \n\u201cWe (the previous NC-Congress government) had started the process of getting international aid by talking to the World Bank. The first meeting, I had with the officials of World Bank and Asian Development Bank before the election code (came into force).\u201d \n \n\u201cWe had prepared a project but there has been no forward movement on that as well. So, we suffered from both the sides. Neither did we get anything from here, nor from where we would have got some money,\u201d the former chief minister said. \n \nTerming as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) decision to celebrate the anniversary of the floods, Omar said, \u201c\u2026The reality is that the people, who were affected by the floods, have got nothing to celebrate.\u201d He said, now, the high court had to take a suo motu notice as a result of \u201cnon-efficiency\u201d of this government. \n \n\u201cThe court has compelled the state as well as the central government to answer. Now, we hope that due to high court\u2019s pressure, people would get something which these people (governments) were unwilling to give till now. They were not ready to give the people anything on their own. Whatever,I had given to people during my regime, they had got nothing more than that,\u201d the former chief minister said. \n \nOmar claimed whatever assistance the flood-affected people got was before March 1. \n \n\u201cSince the PDP-BJP government was sworn-in (March 1), they (victims) have been continuously neglected. Rs 2000-Rs 2500 crore fund that they got with much difficulty was the money from State Disaster Relief Fund and first instalment from Government of India which was announced on the spot during my regime. Not a penny extra,\u201d he alleged. \n \nThe NC leader alleged the Centre took back money which it had given to the state on the account of various expenditures. \n \n\u201cThey took money for many things in the name of flood relief. But those, who suffered losses, did not get anything. Helicopters were used, (but) the money was taken from us. Their boats were used here, but the money was taken from us. The funds meant for liabilities under Prime Minister\u2019s Reconstruction Programme were taken in the name of floods. \n \n\u201cAdditional special plan assistance, which is given to us by the Planning Commission every year to balance our plan, that money was also added to the flood account and taken. That is why, Mufti sahab felt a compulsion to arrest the leaders of trade bodies who were to protest against the government,\u201d Omar said. \n \nCondemning the arrest of leaders of various trade bodies, he said, the chief minister is the same Sayeed who used to say that this is the battle of ideas, but the reality is, if your ideas do not match his, he will not allow you to talk. \n \n\u201cYou (governments) are pushing the people unnecessarily. These traders were not protesting against any country. They were not coming out with anti-national slogans. They were coming out for their rights. \n \n\u201cThe rights which they have been promised of by none other than the Prime Minister of the country who, here in Srinagar, said that we will not only give whatever to this part of Kashmir, but are even ready to help the other side of Kashmir as well. \n \n\u201cThank God, they (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) did not took the help, otherwise their situation would have been same like ours. It is unfortunate that they (leaders of trade bodies) have been arrested for bringing these things to the public domain,\u201d he said. \n \nOmar, in a series of tweets, termed the chief minister as \u201cdictator\u201d for carrying out midnight raids and arrest of trader body leaders. \n \n\u201cIn a series of midnight raids (chief Minister) Mufti (Mohammad) Syed has ensured the arrest of all the Trade Body leaders. Their crime? Unhappiness over flood relief. All these people wanted to do was register their dissatisfaction at the absence of any meaningful flood relief. Shame on Mufti the Dictator,\u201d he tweeted. \n \n\u201cIf Mufti Sb (sahab) was so sure people were going to celebrate as his Govt (government) has planned today he wouldn\u2019t have ordered these arrests. #Dictator,\u201d he said. \n \n\u00a0", "source": "Navhind Times"}
