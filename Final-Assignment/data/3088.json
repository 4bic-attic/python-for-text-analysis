News management and Lupica, who enjoyed one of the newsroom's top salaries, were unable to come to terms on a new contract, the sources said. \nSports editor Teri Thompson also received a pink slip, the sources said.\n\n-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
