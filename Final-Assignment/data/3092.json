One has to think about the audience as a whole, all 60 million people in the UK. For many people broadcast TV is one of their main means of engagement with the outside world, and I think that will be the case for some time to come.\u201d \n \nWhat happens when Freeview loses a third of its spectrum to mobile services? \n \n\u201cAround 100,000 people may need a new aerial as part of realigning the spectrum bands so it means some people effectively end up with their aerial pointing in the wrong direction. From a broadcasting point of view \u2026 we have made it clear that\u2019s not a cost the broadcasters should bear. I don\u2019t think that has actually been decided yet but the principle for us is it\u2019s not a cost either the broadcaster or the consumer should bear as neither of those benefit.\u201d \n \nThese are quotes from a \u201cGuardian\u201d interview with Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive of Digital UK.
