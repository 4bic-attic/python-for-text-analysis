Currently, the Polish carrier performs three flights a day between Warsaw and Frankfurt, offering three travel classes \u2013 LOT Business, LOT Premium Economy and LOT Economy Class as well as the most convenient schedule on this city pair. The first flight from Warsaw to Frankfurt was operated by an Ilyushin 18 aircraft. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, LOT was one of the first airlines using Western-type aircraft \u2013 mainly Boeing 737. Presently flights on this route are operated by comfortable Embraer 170, 175 and 195 aircraft, appreciated by passengers for their cabin comfort. Today, on the 50th anniversary of the inaugural flight, LOT, together with Frankfurt Airport, prepared a surprise for the passengers of the anniversary LO382 flight. Prior to the departure from Frankfurt all passengers participated in the cake cutting ceremony at the gate. \u00a0They were served snacks and refreshments and, naturally, a piece of the cake. Meanwhile, passengers travelling onboard the aircraft from Warsaw to Frankfurt and back to Warsaw heard a special announcement and were served an additional refreshment. \u201cWe are happy to celebrate this anniversary together with Frankfurt Airport and to recall how our offer developed over that time. We are currently the only airline that apart from Business and Economy class also offers LOT Premium Economy class on this route. It means that our passengers have even more freedom in choosing an offer which best suits their individual needs. We are also the carrier of choice for the business traveler. The 7:30 a.m. flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw is the first connection of the day between these two cities, catering to the business traveller community and ideal for a \u00a0one-day business trip\u201d says Jiri Marek, LOT Sales and Distribution Executive Director.\u201cGerman passengers choose Warsaw \u00a0more frequently to connect to LOT\u2019s long-haul flights. Thanks to attractive prices and our Dreamliner fleet, as well as \u00a0continuously improved service, LOT flights with a transfer are becoming an ever more attractive alternative\u201d adds Jiri Marek. Dr. Pierre-Dominique Pr\u00fcmm, head of Fraport AG\u2019s Airside and Terminal Management unit, says: \u201cFraport AG is proud of the long-standing and excellent business relationship between Frankfurt Airport and LOT Polish Airlines. We look forward to the continuation of this very fruitful connection between Frankfurt and Warsaw. LOT is one of the most long-standing airlines serving into Frankfurt Airport. Today, LOT operates a modern fleet of environmentally-friendly aircraft, thus greatly contributing to our common success \u2013 now and in the future. This is all the more reason to celebrate this very special anniversary. We wish LOT many more years of \u2018happy landings\u2019.\u201d LOT offers three flights a day between Warsaw and Frankfurt.
