The architecture automatically and dynamically adapts radio access and core network resources to meet the needs of different services, traffic variations over time and location, and network topology, including transport. \n \nNokia said the service will up the quality of customer experiences and transform the business processes of industry sectors from manufacturing to automotive and healthcare. Operators will be able to offer network functions to any kind of industry under a Network-as-a-Service business model. \n \nNokia's architecture uses a 'system of systems' approach to integrate and align the many different and independent parts of a network to achieve higher performance and more functionality as compared to today's networks. Nearly all network functions will become software-defined, cognitive technologies will automatically orchestrate the network, and content and processing will be distributed across the network close to where they are needed. \n \nMany of the components are already up and running.", "source": "Telecompaper"}
