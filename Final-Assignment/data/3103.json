This splendid garden spider has been building her web against the outside glass of the conservatory\u00a0 so we've had an excellent view of the process. Late one night we were also witness to the courtship\u00a0 advances\u00a0of 'Mr Wincy'\u00a0as he very cautiously\u00a0 vibrated the web and inched forward with one leg tentatively\u00a0reaching out to touch her leg. They both\u00a0 recoiled several times - he seemed to be making some progress but then she lowered herself on a long line out of the \u00a0way - 'not in the mood'. At least he wasn't eaten. \u00a0\ufeff", "source": "magsramsay"}
