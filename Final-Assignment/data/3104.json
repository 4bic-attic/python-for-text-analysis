In a communique, finance ministers and central bankers from the G-20 developed and emerging economies acknowledged recent volatility in financial markets and its underlying economic conditions, without specifically referring to China.  The G-20 leaders called for moving toward more market determined exchange rate systems and vowed to \"refrain from competitive devaluations\" aimed at boosting exports, after China devalued the yuan last month.", "source": "Yahoo!
