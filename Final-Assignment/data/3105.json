Leeds\u2019 Under-18s have won six of their open seven matches, suffering a solitary blip in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace two weeks ago and sit at the top of their professional development league. \n\nPeterborough\u2019s new manager Graham Westley has told the club\u2019s fans to judge him on how his team plays following some negative reaction to his appointment. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nThe 47-year-old\u2019s spell at Preston was overshadowed by reports of player unrest and criticism of both his management and playing style before he was sacked just over a year in charge and Posh fans have also raised concerns. \n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s actions, not words that are going to inspire people. Whatever cynicism or scepticism there is, they\u2019re going to watch the team and they\u2019re going to see the confidence and energy and organisation, the verve and the drive that the team is going to play with. And it\u2019s that they\u2019ll ultimately judge me on.\u201d \n\r \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n        \r  Have you got something to share on the story? \r Were you there?
