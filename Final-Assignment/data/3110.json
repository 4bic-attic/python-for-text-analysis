We said, \u2018We\u2019re going to get you some food.\u2019 We fed them. And we spent the time, to be very honest with you, in view of what our players needed should they take the field.\u201d \n\nMiles said the decision was made at 10:30 p.m. not to re-start the game even with better weather on the way because LSU officials did not want the players still playing at around 3 a.m. \n\n\u201cWe were in a position where, let\u2019s see, if we could have got on the field at 11:45, we would have played it,\u201d Miles said. But Miles said LSU\u2019s doctors were asked about the players\u2019 bodies\u2019 reactions to playing until likely 3 a.m. \n\n\u201cWe asked them very specifically, \u2018What is this like for our athletes?\u2019 Well, they won\u2019t be as reactionary. They will not be as prepared. They will not have food. They will not have nutrition,\u201d Miles said after just saying the players were fed during the delay. \n\n\u201cThey will not have rest,\u201d Miles said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely, I should say a greater percentage chance, that they could have injury, let alone mindset.\u201d \n\nTEUHEMA, CLARK DISCIPLINED?: LSU sophomore backup defensive ends Sione Teuhema and Deondre Clark did not dress out for the LSU-McNeese State game Saturday even though neither is injured and there is no limit to the number of Tigers who can be dressed out for a non-conference home game. \n\nAsked if Teuhema and Clark will dress out for Saturday\u2019s game at Mississippi State (8:15 p.m. on ESPN), Miles said, \u201cI\u2019m not certain. It depends on if they earn their way there. We play the best players. Certainly, if they\u2019re the best players, they\u2019ll step in there and go.\u201d \n\nAsked if Teuhema and Clark did not dress out for disciplinary or performance reasons, Miles said, \u201cIt\u2019s all performance based.\u201d \n\nIn the past, though, many LSU players have dressed out for games despite performance issues because they never played and kept on dressing out for non-conference home games and never played. \n\nStarting defensive end Tashawn Bower was asked about Teuhema and Clark Tuesday. \n\n\u201cIf you get injured or suspended or anything, I really try to tell them that nobody\u2019s job is ever set in stone,\u201d Bower said. \u201cYou\u2019re only going to get on the field by practicing well. I\u2019ve seen players move up the depth chart just from practicing better, and that\u2019s what they have to do.\u201d \n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY : \u201cI think we need to petition to get some cow bells in our stadium. I think it would be an enjoyable piece as well.\u201d \n\n\u2014 LSU coach Les Miles when asked Monday about dealing with the cow bells Mississippi State fans ring at their home games. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/football/2015/09/08/miles-contradicts-explaining-cancellation/71911542/", "source": "Lafayette Daily Advertiser"}
