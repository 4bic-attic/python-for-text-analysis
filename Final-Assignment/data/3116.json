We installed an O-320 via STC, a pretty 0 SMOH engine.  Added 10 gallons of fuel, she was ready to fly. \nMy A&P buddy who did 90% of the work taxied out, added power for the maiden flight, rolled about 100' and the engine rolled back, WAY back, coughed once or twice. \n\nHe did another high power runup... same deal.  The engine would not sustain TO power.  You could taxi all day, though.  Thank God he did not get airborne.  He'd have gone down straight ahead. \n\nOur best guess was that the tanks were not venting properly.  We checked the venting - it seemed OK - but just to be sure, we are going to use vented fuel caps for now to be on the safe side.  The wings came with unvented caps. \n\nNext step, checked fuel flow and cleanliness from the gascolator feeding the carb.  Pretty bright blue fuel, seems clean. \n\nToday, I am going to disconnect the fuel line from the carb and drain about 5 gallons of fuel, time it to see if fuel flow from the entire system is appropriate. \n\nAny other thoughts? Besides fuel, it MIGHT be air.  Inadequate air flow would result in an extreme over-rich condition at high power settings. \n\nCould mag timing cause power loss at high power settings? \n\nRight now, my bird is entirely unsafe to fly until we can correct this problem.   Inputs HUGELY appreciated.  Thanks!", "source": "Pilots of America"}
