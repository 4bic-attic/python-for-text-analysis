(Photo: File photo) \n\nLayoffs this week at Stone Energy follow the company\u2019s yearlong effort to manage resources carefully while oil and gas prices remain low globally. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this coming for a while,\u201d Stone Energy President and CEO Dave Welch said Wednesday. \u201cWe started reducing last year.\u201d \n\nWelch said employee rolls have dipped from about 400 to about 300 employees since late 2014, a number that includes retirements and natural attrition. He declined to say how many jobs were lost this week\u00a0but said losses were felt around the company, which has sites in Lafayette, Houston, West Virginia, New Orleans and deepwater. \n\nIn January, Stone Energy announced it was cutting its operating budget from $875 million in 2014 to $450 million this year. About three-quarters of its budget was allocated to Gulf of Mexico deepwater activity; 8 percent to Appalachia, primarily around West Virgina; 4 percent to business development and 13 percent to abandonment expenditures. The company's emphasis in deepwater and in Appalachia was because of lower operating expenses. \n\nLease operating expenses were cut by some 40 percent, he said, administration by about 20. \n\n\u201cWhen the price for your product drops in half, people are telling you they don\u2019t need more of your profit,\u201d he said. Some financial forecasters are predicting that prices will remain low through 2016, although Welch said that\u2019s not certain. The careful choice for leadership, he said, is to keep expenses \u201clower for longer\u201d within the company. \n\nStone Energy strengths include two Gulf of Mexico sites that provide additional development opportunities. The company\u2019s risks in the Gulf are lower and Stone Energy can \u201ccarry its product forward over the next few years,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are hoping for a rebound, but we cannot plan on it,\u201d he said. The intention going forward, he said, is to spend within the company\u2019s profits. \n\nStone Energy did not file Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices of the layoffs with the state because layoffs were diffused and did not meet minimum benchmarks for WARN notices in Louisiana. \n\nWelch declined to name specific positions where layoffs occurred, but said since the workforce reductions have started, there have been one executive and six managers laid off. Other individual contributors who have lost their jobs include \u201chighly trained and educated\u201d people whose jobs were important to the company. \n\nLayoffs represent \u201cthe worst part of the job by far,\u201d Welch said \u2014\u00a0for managers who make the announcements but especially for those who lose their jobs. \n\n\u201cSometimes these cycles come and we do what we have to do,\u201d he said. Welch, who has served as president and CEO for 12 years,\u00a0said recent downturns include those of 1999-2000; 2008, which he said was short term; and the current downturn. \n\nHe said the company would continue community\u00a0volunteering efforts, which include a high-profile cookout for United Way and work in the public schools. \n\n\u201cOur people will continue to step up. It\u2019s part of who we are,\u201d he said. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/money/business/2015/09/30/stone-layoffs-apace-oil-downturn/731", "source": "Lafayette Daily Advertiser"}
