Apple demoed things like shopping apps during the device\u2019s big unveiling, but it\u2019s clear that the main target here is gaming. Lots and lots of gaming. If there\u2019s one thing that game developers like to know, it\u2019s what hardware they are dealing with. Unfortunately, Apple isn\u2019t known for sharing just what internals its devices carry, and the new Apple TV\u2019s specifications page on apple.com is suitably sparse, but all is not lost! In a break from the norm, Apple has detailed additional information about\u00a0what is inside the fourth-generation Apple TV or, at least, it has to developers. As is always the case, though, it didn\u2019t take long for those developers to tell the world. Thank you, devs! While we already had some inklings as to what was beating at the heart of the Apple TV 4, the complete list of specifications makes for an interesting reading. On top of the Apple A8 64-bit CPU that we already knew about, it appears that Apple\u2019s new set-top box also ships with 2GB of RAM. That\u2019s more than the iPhone 6, for example, and should see the Apple TV perform particularly well when it comes to handling cache from video streams. Did we mention gaming? Games like RAM! Another interesting tidbit is the fact that the Apple TV still\u00a0does not ship with a gigabit Ethernet port, but it has 802.11ac WiFi, meaning the new 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi will be quicker than plugging a cable into the back of the thing. Apple has also removed the optical audio output from the back of the new Apple TV, meaning the only way to get sound out of the device\u00a0is via HDMI \u2013 a real shame to those with more interesting home audio setups. There are HDMI doohickeys that can get around this particular problem, but when an upgrade removes a port you\u2019re already using, that never leaves a good taste in the mouth! That said, people complained when the floppy disk and then SuperDrive was removed from Macs, too. Following is a shot of the specifications on the official Apple TV page: And here are the specifications from developer documents, revealing RAM which isn\u2019t mentioned publicly on the main Apple TV page on Apple\u2019s website: 64-bit A8 processor 32GB or 64GB of storage 2GB of RAM 10/100Mbps Ethernet WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 1080p resolution HDMI New Siri Remote / Apple TV Remote Thoughts?
