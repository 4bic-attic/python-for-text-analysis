However, he could not give a reasonable excuse as to how it was discovered in Barton. \n  \nHe was fined \u00a3450, \u00a3440 in costs, a victim surcharge and court fees totalling \u00a31,085. \n\nSouth Cambridgeshire District Council is reiterating the need for residents to make sure that they use authorised waste carriers, registered with the Environment Agency, to dispose of rubbish. \n\nIf you see someone in the act of fly tipping please contact the Police on 999.

I hope this prosecution shows everyone that it doesn't matter if waste is dumped miles from your home, we will still make every effort to find the culprit.\"", "source": "Cambridge News"}
