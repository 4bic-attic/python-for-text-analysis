The film Nanny McPhee II was dedicated to her name.\u201d \n\nRob\u2019s trip will take him from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. \n\nBut he won\u2019t be alone because he\u2019ll be accompanied on by  the trip by work colleague Patrick Konrath, also a novice cyclist. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nRob added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been training for the past six months at Beverley Leisure centre and on local roads.  Our aim is to raise as much money as possible to help fund research towards this great cause, that affects around 30,000 people per year in the UK. \n\n\u201cOur company is funding the cost of all equipment and travel expenses running in to well over \u00a35,000, and all donations  will go directly to the charity. \n\n\u201cThe challenge represents a huge one in more ways than one, and has required at least  nine months of training up to 70 miles per day. \n\n\u201cIt will culminate in us climbing some of the largest peaks in the world, including many of the infamous climbs seen on television in the Tour de France.\u201d Rob\u2019s target is to  raise \u00a35000.
