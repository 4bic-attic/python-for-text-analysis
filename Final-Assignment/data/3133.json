Politicians can propose and campaign. But only the people can decide.\" \n \nShe added: \"Only the people can decide if we will have another referendum. \n \n\"Only the people can decide when that will be. \n \n\"And only the people can decide if Scotland will become independent.\"", "source": "BT.com"}
