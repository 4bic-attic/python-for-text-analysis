Last year, he played 12 games before suffering a season-ending spleen injury against Houston and finished with 28 receptions for 498 yards and three scores.\n\nHunter caught one pass for 11 yards on Sunday in the Titans' season-opening 42-14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe Titans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Ginsburg in Washington; Editing by Bill Trott)", "source": "1440 WNFL"}
