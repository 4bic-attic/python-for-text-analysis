The alleged slight took place aboard Trump's plane following a rally in Hampton, New Hampshire. The candidate was watching Fox News as staff members looked on. Reporter Paul Solotaroff described Trump's reaction\u00a0when Fiorina appeared on screen:\u00a0 \n\n\" Look \u00a0at that face!\" he cries. \"Would anyone\u00a0 vote \u00a0for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next\u00a0 president ?!\" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. \"I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we\u00a0 serious ?\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!\u201d \n \nDonald Trump \n \n\"I think those comments speak for themselves,\" Fiorina said Wednesday on Megyn Kelly's show, adding, \"Maybe, just maybe I'm getting under his skin a little bit because I am climbing in the polls.\"\u00a0 \n\nIn fact, Trump had also singled out Fiorina at the Hampton rally, warning her in terms similar to those he used with moderator Kelly during the first Republican debate. \n\n\"Carly was a little nasty to me\u2014be\u00a0 careful, \u00a0Carly! Be\u00a0 careful ! But I can't say anything to her because she's a woman.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u00a0 promised \u00a0that I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground. I said I wouldn't say it! That her stock value tanked. That she laid off tens of thousands of people, and she got viciously fired. I said I will not\u00a0 say \u00a0that. And that she then went out and ran against Barbara\u00a0 Boxer, \u00a0and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009lost in a landslide. And I said, 'I. Will. Not. Say. That!'\u2009\" \n\nFiorina, who had\u00a0strong performance in the GOP's undercard debate, lashed out at Trump over his attack on Kelly, tweeting, \"Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse.\" \n\nThe two candidates will share the stage during the second Republican debate on Sept. 17 on CNN.\u00a0\u00a0", "source": "Bloomberg"}
