Man elected to school board despite winning zero votes", "id": "ce02d195-c858-4a00-b1dd-0286ba652c7e", "content": "It\u2019s not all doom and gloom as we take a look at some of the lighter news bites from around the world. \n\nUSA: \u00a0An Iowa farmer who was running unopposed for his local school board failed to earn any votes \u2014 not even his own \u2014 but he\u2019ll probably still get the job. \n \nRandy Richardson, 42, didn\u2019t find time to vote for himself between his full-time maintenance job at a bean processing plant in Riceville and his chores on his farm near McIntire, the Des Moines Register reported. \n \nRichardson was recruited to run by school staff, and though he said he\u2019s \u201crun paper thin the way it is,\u201d he agreed because he has two kids in the district. \n \nNeighbour Jessie Miller said there wasn\u2019t any key issue to drive her to vote in the school board race. \u201cI would\u2019ve voted for him!\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome guy.\u201d \n \nAcross the entire school district, only 36 people voted in the election. \n \nThief in Elvis wig\u00a0 \n\nUSA:\u00a0 Grover Beach police are searching for a man accused of robbing the Monarch Grover Winery tasting room while wearing a mask and an Elvis wig. \n \nThe Tribune in San Luis Obispo reports that the man took about $400 in cash. He showed a black pistol to an employee before binding the employee\u2019s wrists with duct tape and confining the victim to the restroom. \n \nPolice say the robber wore an old man mask and a wig. He was last seen walking south on Highway 1. \n \nLoose snake \n\nEngland:\u00a0 A 2m snake has escaped from its home, police said. The boa constrictor \u2014 known for holding its prey in a lethal grip \u2014 went missing from a home in Kells, Whitehaven, Cumbria. The snake, a household pet, escaped after being left momentarily unattended while being cleaned. \n \nGroundsman\u2019s gaffe \n\nEngland:\u00a0 A groundsman who applied the wrong type of weedkiller to the square at Henley Cricket Club has been let go, the Henley Standard reported. \n \nTony King, whose mistake in July turned a large area of the Brakspear ground brown, has not had his contract renewed. \n \nClub chairman Brian Kenworthy said: \u201cI think sacked is too stronger term. We have agreed to go our separate ways.\u201d \n \nA to ZE \n\nUSA:\u00a0 Harvard University is starting to ask its students which gender pronouns they want to be referred by \u2014 and is adding more options to the usual \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019. \n \nThe registration form includes gender-neutral options such as \u2018ze\u2019, and gives new options to transgender students and those who do not identify as male or female. In the past, forms required them to choose between \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d. \n \nExperts say colleges are changing as they recognise the growing population of transgender students, and many have created special campus housing for the group, but changes have sparked backlash at some schools. The University of Tennessee removed a guide to gender-neutral pronouns on its website after it drew outrage from state senators. \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
