John Thune (R-S.D.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), urged the administration to immediately adopt stage two modifications for the federal government\u2019s program to require\u00a0doctors and hospitals to create electronic health records systems and make the rules for stage three final no sooner than January 1, 2017. \n \nThe chairmen\u2019s call comes as a bipartisan group of 96 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the House of Representatives in a separate letter to the administration urged it to \u201cpause\u201d the process of making stage three rules final. \n \n\u201cThe government, doctors, and hospitals need time to do [stage three] right,\u201d said the chairmen, and warned against moving too fast. \n \nIn a letter sent yesterday to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Thune, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Alexander, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, wrote, \u201cPatients need an interoperable system that enables doctors and hospitals to share their electronic health records, but the government, doctors, and hospitals need time to do it right. \n \n\u201cTo date, taxpayers\u00a0have invested\u00a0$30 billion to encourage electronic health records adoption.

The Senate Health Committee has jurisdiction over the administration\u2019s program that certifies that health information technology has met the necessary requirements to participate in the meaningful use program. \n \nFull text of the letter can be found below: \n \nThe Honorable Sylvia Burwell \nSecretary \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n200 Independence Ave, SW \nWashington, DC 20201 \n \nDear Secretary Burwell, \n \nWe write to request that the\u00a0department\u00a0delay until no sooner than January 1, 2017, making final rules for\u00a0stage three of\u00a0the meaningful use program,\u00a0and then phase in stage three requirements at a rate that reflects how successfully the program is being implemented.\u00a0In addition, we\u00a0ask\u00a0that the modified rule proposed for stage two of the program\u00a0be adopted immediately.\u00a0These actions\u00a0will help most\u00a0doctors and hospitals to comply with the government\u2019s requirements. \n \nPatients need an interoperable system that enables doctors and hospitals to share their electronic health records, but the government, doctors, and hospitals need time to do it right.\u00a0\u00a0To date, taxpayers\u00a0have invested\u00a0$30 billion to encourage electronic health records adoption. While all hospitals and most physicians met the requirements of the first stage of the\u00a0meaningful use program, stage two requirements are so complex that only about 12 percent of eligible physicians and 40 percent of eligible hospitals have been able to comply.\u00a0This year alone, 257,000 physicians have seen a 1 percent reduction in their Medicare reimbursements and 200 hospitals stand to see an even greater reduction.\u00a0 The modified stage two rule will enable more providers to comply with the government\u2019s requirements.\u00a0\u00a0It should be adopted immediately to give physicians and hospitals time to adapt to these huge changes. \n \nIf the department does not delay\u00a0making final the stage three rules\u00a0and instead proceeds before it can measure\u00a0the impact of the modified stage two rule,\u00a0it will be a missed opportunity to build support among providers.\u00a0 Pausing the stage three rules will also enable the department to ensure its final rules align with the new payment models\u00a0created by\u00a0the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System. \n \nFor many years, our constituents have contacted us\u00a0about their frustrations\u00a0with\u00a0the implementation of the meaningful use program.\u00a0 We respectfully request that you\u00a0delay making final the\u00a0stage three rules and immediately\u00a0adopt\u00a0the modifications to the stage two rule.\u00a0 We look forward to your response \n \nSincerely, \n \n\u00a0 \n \n### \n Twitter", "source": "South Dakota War College"}
