But that may have happened this past summer in the chemistry literature. In July, a group of researchers recapitulated an experiment largely similar to one that Nobelist Georg Wittig had performed \u2013 and subsequently retracted \u2014 decades earlier. Their findings suggest\u00a0Wittig may actually have gotten it right the first time. On July 27, Peter Chen of ETH Zurich and colleagues published an article online in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition that describes a new method for appending a carbon atom to an unsaturated hydrocarbon to create a three-membered ring \u2013 a useful chemical transformation known as cyclopropanation. Yet, it was not the first time researchers had reported such a process. As Chen and his colleagues note in the Israel Journal of Chemistry, Georg Wittig of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg (who would go on to win the chemistry Nobel Prize in 1979) and Volker Franzen reported a similar reaction in 1960 in Angewandte Chemie, a German-language publication. But when Wittig asked student Dietlinde Krauss to replicate the findings, she \u201ccould not reproduce the 1960 results under any set of conditions,\u201d Chen and his team wrote in the Israel Journal of Chemistry, and, in 1964: Wittig explicitly retracted the claim. That \u201cretraction\u201d is not a retraction per se. Authored by Krauss and Wittig, but not Franzen, it was published in a separate German-language journal called Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, which subsequently was folded into the European Journal of Organic Chemistry. In that article, Krauss and Wittig write in a footnote (as translated by Google), \u201cThe findings of V. Franzen and G. Wittig \u2026 could therefore not be confirmed.\u201d Chen characterized the 1964 article to Retraction Watch as a \u201crepudiation.\u201d And in a subsequent email, he wrote: If you read what Wittig writes in 1964, it is a retraction because he disavows the work explicitly. Whatever you call it, the fact remains that after 1964, the paper effectively disappeared. Chen and his team stumbled upon it as they were developing their own method for cyclopropanation. Although they were disappointed to find out they\u2019d been scooped, Chen told Retraction Watch he was surprised to see\u00a0that the 1960 paper had essentially fallen off the chemistry world\u2019s radar. As he and his colleagues write in IJC: There have been no further publications following up the 1960 Franzen and Wittig Angewandte Chemie Communication after 1964, so definitive was the final judgment by Wittig. According to Chen, this assertion reflects the reference tool, SciFinder. According to Web of Science, the 1960 article has been cited 47 times, most recently \u2014 other than by Chen \u2014 in 1996, and only 13 times since 1970. Importantly, however, said Chen, none of these papers actually \u201cfollow up the work.\u201d Presumably, Wittig had this tremendous reputation, that his experimentals always worked. And when he said it doesn\u2019t work, then everybody took it at face value that it doesn\u2019t work. How then to explain the original report? There were but two possibilities, Chen told us: Either Wittig\u2019s co-author was \u201clying outright,\u201d or the experiment had, in fact, worked the first time. Assuming the latter, the team then set about determining why it might have worked once and then not again. The reaction detailed by Chen exhibits what he calls \u00a0\u201csort of a weird set of conditions.\u201d Among other things, the reaction requires a nickel catalyst at a specific concentration, and a sealed container. It isn\u2019t possible, of course, to know what did or didn\u2019t happen decades ago, but it seems \u201ceminently plausible that Franzen\u2019s experiment worked because of adventitious nickel,\u201d Chen said. It\u2019s not actually that hard for nickel to infiltrate a reaction, Chen noted. Catalysts often are active at very low concentrations. Nickel \u00a0is a known impurity of lithium, which is used in the reaction. It also is found in steel, and could have leached out during incubations with acid in the procedure. Even today, trace metal impurities can be remarkably hard to detect and eliminate. \u201cWittig was obviously a bright guy,\u201d Chen said: He got the Nobel Prize for heaven\u2019s sake. But he was not looking for a metal-catalyzed reaction. Chen\u2019s team, though, was looking. So we were more primed to find this solution, which they never thought of. But it still took his team five years to hit upon the right combination of catalyst and conditions to make everything work. Since Wittig and Krauss didn\u2019t realize the reaction needed nickel to proceed, however, they couldn\u2019t replicate the reaction and assumed it was incorrect. John Montgomery, the Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Medicinal or Synthetic Chemistry at the University of Michigan, an expert in nickel chemistry, told us that this missing catalyst could certainly have foiled reproducibility efforts: The unusual nickel concentration requirements described by Chen would certainly add to irreproducibilities from batch to batch of the reagents employed at the time. I credit Franzen and Wittig for issuing the retraction since all they knew at the time was that the process could not be reproduced. And he said\u00a0that such things have happened before: \u2026 you could draw parallel to the Nozaki Hiyama Kishi (NHK) coupling reaction, which is a significant named reaction originally found to be irreproducible when CrCl2 was used. But later it was found that nickel contaminants were required to promote the reaction. It is now a widely used synthetic method that routinely uses very low levels of nickel to promote catalysis. It is unfortunate that Franzen and Wittig were not able conduct trace metal analysis of their reagents to look for this type of source of the irreproducibility. So does that mean it\u2019s time to retract the 1964 retraction? Chen doesn\u2019t think so. The work done in the 1964 paper is not wrong; Krauss just never got the right combination. Her reports are accurate and well documented, but they never considered that the reaction could have been catalyzed. In their IJC essay, Chen and his team lay out several lessons they took from the experience: For one, don\u2019t neglect the \u201cold\u201d literature in favor of more recent synopses: There are jewels buried in the literature, and it takes reading of the original, primary publications to dig them out. Also: Consider what it means to get negative results. Evidence that something does not work is no proof that it cannot work. Finally, they write: Critically question what your professors say. The education of a scientist is successful when he or she exercises reason and creativity to form an opinion despite what authority says must be true. Science is ultimately self-correcting.
