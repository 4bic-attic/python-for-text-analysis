Now, with My Cloud OS 3, we've made users' management of their digital lives easier than ever before.\"\n\nMy Cloud OS 3 features powerful new photo and video capabilities via two new user experiences: MyCloud.com and My Cloud Albums app. MyCloud.com provides users global access to their My Cloud via an intuitive web browser-based user interface and enables file collaboration, comprehensive access management and a photos and videos gallery view. My Cloud Albums, available for download late September on iTunes and Google Play stores, allows a My Cloud OS 3 user to send a link to a common location, or \"album\", on the My Cloud to all their friends and family.\n\nMy Cloud OS 3's new WD Sync\u2122 feature syncs data across multiple PCs and notebooks, ensuring that important files are up to date and available to users from almost any device. The new OS also allows users to set up automatic camera-roll backup of photos from smartphones and tablets and offers a new transfer tool that enables users to easily and quickly move their files to My Cloud devices. The OS also includes Chromebook and Chromecast support.\n\nAs part of the My Cloud OS 3 launch, WD has introduced My Cloud Device SDK and My Cloud API enabling developers to build new extensions, features and capabilities within the My Cloud ecosystem of personal cloud storage devices. The My Cloud Device SDK, based on the Docker\u2122 open platform technology, ensures developers can easily access and collaborate to create customized experiences. Partners already developing extensions and new features based on the new SDK include Plex and Milestone.\n\nIn addition to new software upgrades, WD has also introduced a new version of My Cloud Mirror personal cloud storage devices, featuring two hard drives set to Mirror Mode (RAID 1), ensuring content is stored on one drive and automatically duplicated to a second drive. My Cloud Mirror personal cloud storage includes the new features announced for My Cloud OS 3 and an improved processor and 512 MB RAM for faster file transfers and application support.\n\nAttendees of the annual IFA Consumer Electronics Unlimited show in Berlin \n\nPricing and Availability\n\nWD My Cloud OS 3 will be available at the end of the month as a free download on current My Cloud personal cloud storage devices.
