Yesterday, after about 6 months of planning and work, Alexandra managed to get her Free Speech event at Parliament hill. Thanks to Victor Laszlo, we have a record of the event. \n \n[embedded content] \n \n2.\u00a0 Turkish magazine raided, copies seized for mock Erdogan selfie \n \nANKARA (Reuters) \u2013 Turkish police raided a magazine early on Monday over a mocked-up \u201cselfie\u201d of a smiling President Tayyip Erdogan with the coffin of a soldier \u2013 an allusion to comments that families of soldiers killed by Kurdish rebels could be happy about their martyrdom. \n \nAn Istanbul prosecutor\u2019s office banned distribution of the latest edition of Nokta magazine and ordered raids on its offices over charges of \u201cinsulting the Turkish president\u201d and \u201cmaking terrorist propaganda\u201d, after the cover was published online, the magazine said in a statement. \n \n\u201cOur cover that prompted the police raid may be harsh, disturbing or even cruel. (But) these are not crimes for a media institution, this is our form of speech,\u201d the statement said. \n  \n3.\u00a0 Russian Flights Over Iraq and Iran Escalate Tension With U.S. \n \n(Obama really is the best or worst ever president the US ever had. It all just depends on who\u2019s interests he is serving and what his real ambitions are) \n \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Russia is using an air corridor over Iraq and Iran to fly military equipment and personnel to a new air hub in Syria , openly defying American efforts to block the shipments and significantly increasing tensions with Washington. \n \nAmerican officials disclosed Sunday that at least seven giant Russian Condor transport planes had taken off from a base in southern Russia during the past week to ferry equipment to Syria, all passing through Iranian and Iraqi airspace. \n \nTheir destination was an airfield south of Latakia, Syria, which could become the most significant new Russian military foothold in the Middle East in decades, American officials said. \n  \n4.\u00a0 The Latest: Hungarian Police Block Key Crossing for Migrants \n \nThe latest developments as European governments rush to cope with the huge number of people moving across Europe. All times local (CET): \n \nDozens of Hungarian police have moved onto the rail line near Roszke that has been migrants\u2019 major border crossing point, getting ready to close the remaining gap in the country\u2019s 110-mile (177-kilometer) border fence. \n \nHundreds of migrants seeking to enter Hungary along the rail line have been halted in their tracks as engineers on a truck string barbed wire along steel fence posts. A police helicopter is hovering overhead. \n \nPolice are telling migrants to head through farm fields to Hungary\u2019s nearest approved border crossing, a road 2 kilometers (1 mile) to the west. \n \nPolice say they plan to block the rail line itself later with a train cargo container covered with seven coils of razor wire. \n  \n5.

It was so infuriating that people I spoke with had to be pushed to try and make it to the end) \n  \n\n \nMICHAL CIZEK/AFP/ \n  \nby  Raheem Kassam 14 Sep 2015 518 \n   \nOver the course of this weekend we have heard no end of left-wing politicians and media commentators taking to the airwaves to claim that the British public overwhelmingly support Britain accepting more migrants into the United Kingdom. But frankly, the polling just doesn\u2019t reflect this. BBC anchors, Channel 4 hosts, Labour politicians and even foreign political commentators are claiming that Britons are amenable to the idea of more refugees. \n  \nThank you Richard, Victor Laszlo, Nash Montana, Liberty Dk., M., Buck and all. \n \nLastly it looks like his holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has perfectly expressed what most British people are feeling about accepting hundreds of thousands of hostile muslims into their country at their expense. \n \n\n \n( Naw not really . Just more of the usual Captain Hindsight stuff we have come to expect from religious leaders who want everyone else to pay for their moral superiority)", "source": "Before Its News"}
