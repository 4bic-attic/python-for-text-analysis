But when the last one died about ten years ago, they concluded that\u2013pushing 80\u2013they were too old to take in another dog. \n \nAnd they\u2019ve been without a dog ever since. \n \n\n \nHey, ma\u2013we all know what\u2019s going on\u2026 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nFor the longest time, I was adamant against my mom feeding scraps to the dog. \n \nI\u2019d say things like\u2026 \n \n\u201cStop it, ma\u2013you\u2019re spoiling that dog!\u201d \n \nOr\u2026 \n \n\u201cC\u2019mon, ma\u2013we\u2019re trying to teach that dog not to beg. You\u2019re ruining our training!\u201d \n \nOr\u2026 \n \n\u201cMa, that food\u2019s too rich for the dog. She\u2019s gonna get the runs!\u201d \n \nAnd my mom would be a little like the Gilly character created by Kristen Wiig. She\u2019d say, \u201csorry.\u201d \n \nThen she\u2019d go right back to feeding the dog scraps a few moments later. \n \nWell, time\u2019s worn away my opposition to this not-so-discreet, under-the-table chicken-scrap feeding thing. \n \nSo when my folks came for dinner on Sunday, I\u00a0pretended not to see what was happening right in front of my eyes. \n \nI mean, really\u2013who the hell am I to complain? \n \nThe dog\u2019s pushing 11, and my mom\u2019s pushing 90. I say let `em enjoy this chicken-scrap feeding moment for as long as they can share it. \n \nLife is short, chicken is good. \n \nOr as someone else said about something in a similar context \u2026 \n \nI was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now.", "source": "The Third City"}
