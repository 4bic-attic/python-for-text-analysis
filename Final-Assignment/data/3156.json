I hate the Banker even more now! Playing for Children\u2019s Hospice South West \u2013 a charity very close to my heart \u2013 was the icing on our 10th birthday cake,\u2019\u2019 Noel said. \n \nNoel believed he was hosting a show with 22 of the most memorable past contestants, including the first person to win 1p. He said he never suspected for a moment the ball containing the name of the player would have his inside. \n \n\u201cJust for a second, I had to think \u2018Do we have someone playing called Noel?\u2019 Then it went \u2018clang\u2019. I cracked open another ball to be sure, and that one said Noel as well. And then Sarah Millican walked out. But it was a very slow penny-drop,\u201d he said. \n   Promoted stories    \nI'm hosting a very special @dealornodeal on Friday at 8pm on Channel 4. #Deal10 Watch @noeledmonds get pranked! \n \n\u2014 Sarah Millican (@SarahMillican75) September 15, 2015 \n \nHe said that watching 2,750 contestants still didn\u2019t make his own turn any easier, nor did risking money that could go to charity. \u201cI really did feel the pressure. At one point I got very, very choked up,\u201d he admitted. \n \nNoel has had plenty of experience watching celebrities flounder under the pressure, with Joan Collins, James Corden and Louis Walsh among the famous names to appear. Olly Murs is the only person to appearance twice on the show, with combined winnings of \u00a310.50. \n \nAs the show celebrated its tenth anniversary, Noel let us in on some secrets behind the show \u2013 like how he turned down an offer to host the TV schedule stalwart three times. \n  \nAfter 10 fab years @NoelEdmonds takes to the Crazy Chair. Don't miss it! Fri 18th Sept, 8pm, @Channel4  #dealornodeal  pic.twitter.com/wLXFsEMfKt \n \n\u2014 Deal or No Deal (@dealornodeal) September 10, 2015 \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s how bright I am. I have to be honest, I had no idea that it would be the phenomenon that it\u2019s turned out to be. I was originally contracted to do 66 shows, and I\u2019ve hosted nearly 3,000,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Swapshop favourite also revealed that the notoriously miserly banker had given away more than \u00a340 million in the show\u2019s 10 year history \u2013 more than any UK gameshow, including Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? \n \nNoel gushed about how lucky he was to have the show \u2013 \u201cten of the happiest years of my life\u201d \u2013 as it is where he met his wife Liz, the show\u2019s make-up artist. \n Noel Edmonds met his wife Liz Davies on the show when she was his make-up artist (Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nAnd Deal or No Deal has played matchmaker more than once. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four or five proposals, and I believe we\u2019ve had the same number of marriages as a result,\u201d Noel said. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nYou\u2019ll have to watch Sarah Millican Hijacks Deal or No Deal on 18\u00a0September at 8pm on Channel 4 to see how much Noel wins.", "source": "Cotswold Journal"}
