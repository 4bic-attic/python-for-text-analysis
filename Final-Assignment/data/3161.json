He hits the ball really flat, has fantastic timing on both sides and it was hard to read the ball in the first two sets,\" said 28-year-old Murray after his eighth career comeback from two sets to love down. \n\n\"I was leaving the ball too short and he made me do a lot of running.\" \n\nMurray, who had needed four sets to beat Nick Kyrgios in the opening round, fired 21 aces -- the last of which was on match point -- while Mannarino was undone by 61 unforced errors. \n\nIt was a familiar tale of woe for the 27-year-old Frenchman, who also had a two sets to love lead over Feliciano Lopez at the Australian Open in January before retiring with heat exhaustion in the fourth set. \nSports & Recreation Tennis Andy Murray Adrian Mannarino", "source": "Yahoo!
