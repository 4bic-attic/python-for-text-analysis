Full-year 2015 EPS guidance is still in the range of $4.55 to \n      $4.65. \n\n\u201cWe are reaffirming our 2015 earnings per share guidance of $4.55 to \n      $4.65,\u201d said Raymond McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of \n      Moody\u2019s. \u201cWe continue to see generally accessible financial market \n      conditions, as well as strong demand for many of our Moody\u2019s Analytics \n      products. However, market volatility and subdued economic growth in some \n      regions continue to moderate fixed income activity.\u201d \n   \nCertain components of Moody\u2019s 2015 revenue guidance have been modified \n      to reflect the Company\u2019s current view of business conditions. While \n      global Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMIS\u201d) revenue for full-year 2015 is \n      still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, \n      non-U.S. MIS revenue is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit \n      percent range. Additionally, while global Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue for \n      full-year 2015 is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit \n      percent range, professional services revenue is now expected to decrease \n      in the low-double-digit percent range. \n\nA full summary of Moody\u2019s guidance as of September 30, 2015 is included \n      in the table at the end of this press release. Moody's outlook for 2015 \n      is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market \n      factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business \n      investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing \n      and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. There is an important \n      degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual \n      conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially \n      from the current outlook. \n\nMoody's is holding its 2015 Investor Day conference today in New York \n      City. \n\nThe event will also be accessible through a live conference call. \n      Individuals within the U.S. and Canada can access the call by dialing \n      1-855-309-1713 toll-free.

In connection with the \n      \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \n      of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause \n      actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by \n      these forward-looking statements. Those factors, risks and uncertainties \n      include, but are not limited to, the current world-wide credit market \n      disruptions and economic slowdown, which is affecting and could continue \n      to affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic \n      and/or global capital markets; other matters that could affect the \n      volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global \n      capital markets, including credit quality concerns, changes in interest \n      rates and other volatility in the financial markets; the level of merger \n      and acquisition activity in the US and abroad; the uncertain \n      effectiveness and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign \n      government initiatives to respond to the current world-wide credit \n      disruptions and economic slowdown; concerns in the marketplace affecting \n      our credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the \n      integrity or utility of independent agency ratings; the introduction of \n      competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressure \n      from competitors and/or customers; the level of success of new product \n      development and global expansion; the impact of regulation as an NRSRO, \n      the potential for new U.S., state and local legislation and regulations, \n      including provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n      Protection Act and anticipated regulations resulting from that Act; the \n      potential for increased competition and regulation in the EU and other \n      foreign jurisdictions; exposure to litigation related to our rating \n      opinions, as well as any other litigation to which the Company may be \n      subject from time to time; provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act legislation \n      modifying the pleading standards, and EU regulations modifying the \n      liability standards, applicable to credit rating agencies in a manner \n      adverse to credit rating agencies; provisions of EU regulations imposing \n      additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of \n      services; the possible loss of key employees; failures or malfunctions \n      of our operations and infrastructure; any vulnerabilities to cyber \n      threats or other cybersecurity concerns; the outcome of any review by \n      controlling tax authorities of the Company\u2019s global tax planning \n      initiatives; the outcome of those legacy tax matters and legal \n      contingencies that relate to the Company, its predecessors and their \n      affiliated companies for which Moody\u2019s has assumed portions of the \n      financial responsibility; the impact of mergers, acquisitions or other \n      business combinations and the ability of the Company to successfully \n      integrate acquired businesses; currency and foreign exchange volatility; \n      the levels of capital investments; a decline in the demand for credit \n      risk management tools by financial institutions; and other risk factors \n      as discussed in the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year \n      ended December 31, 2014 and in other filings made by the Company from \n      time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n2015 Outlook \n\nMoody\u2019s outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many \n      macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, \n      corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and \n      acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the \n      amount of debt issued.
