After Trump questioned whether Rand Paul, sagging in the polls, should even be on the stage, the Kentucky Senator shot back, \u201cThere is a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump.\u201d \n \nThat exchange came after Fiorina, emerging as one of Trump\u2019s most assertive critics of Trump\u2019s temperament, described the tycoon as \u201ca wonderful entertainer.\u201d \n \n\u201cWhat I am,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cfar and away, greater than an entertainer, is a businessman, and that\u2019s the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back.\u201d \n \nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, largely stayed out of the personal exchanges. He credited Trump with forcing media attention on illegal immigration, and highlighted his staunch opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. \n \n\u201cIf I am elected president,\u201d Cruz said, \u201con the very first day in office I would rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\u201d \n \nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry exited the race last week because of sagging standing in the polls. \n \nThe GOP candidates have begun to turn attention to the Lone Star State, which holds its primary on March 1. \n \nGoing into Wednesday night\u2019s debate, a new poll of Texas Republican voters showed Cruz in third place in his home state, behind Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. \n \nThe Crosswind Media poll showed Trump leading the field in the Lone Star State with 26 percent, followed by Ben Carson at 19 percent, and Cruz at 15 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the scion of a famed Texas political family, was fourth in Texas at 9 percent. \n \nTrump has solidified his frontrunner status overall, but his competitors were battling to steal some attention. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson hoped to maintain his momentum, while Bush desperately triedto land some punches with only five months until the Iowa caucuses. \n \nBush questioned Trump\u2019s temperament as a leader, on ongoing theme during the encounter. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, you know, talk about stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result,\u201d Bush told Trump. \n \nOn a nationally televised stage before Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential jet, the candidate with the most at stake might have been Bush, the early leader who has raised more than $100 million in outside political money and campaign cash. \n \nBush, the establishment favorite has been ratcheting up his criticism of Trump in recent weeks, questioning the political newcomer\u2019s conservative bona fides. \n \nBush  recounted his \u201cconservative record\u201d in Florida, where he said Trump\u2019s efforts to open a casino were rebuffed. \n \n\u201cTotally false,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI can promise that if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.\u201d \n \nIf Trump had a central debate objective, it was to show that there\u2019s some serious presidential mettle behind his TV star showmanship. A seemingly relaxed Trump told an interviewer during a golf outing Tuesday that he was going to try to \u201ctone it down a little bit.\u201d \n \nBut that was apparently a piece of strategic misdirection. Trump knew going in that as the poll leader in the race, most of the attacks would be directed at him. \n \n\u201cMr. Trump, we don\u2019t need an \u2018Apprentice\u2019 in the White House,\u201d said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in a reference to Trump\u2019s reality television series. \u201cWe have one right now.\u201d \n \nBut one of the testiest exchanges was another confrontation between Bush and Trump, who has suggested Bush\u2019s views on immigration are softened by his Mexican-born wife. \n \nBush demanded an apology. He didn\u2019t get it. \n \nCNN, which broadcast the debate from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., had been promoting the debate as a Trump-Bush showdown. \n \nBut it was Fiorina - newly promoted to the main event from last month\u2019s undercard - who most forcefully went after Trump\u2019s top calling card: his business acumen. \n \nShe attacked him on his failed gambling casinos in Atlantic City, to which Trump responded he had still made plenty of money there. \n \nAnother sharp attack on Trump came from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, one of four candidates in an earlier debate featuring Republicans who have finished outside the top 10 in an aggregate of polls. \u201cLet\u2019s stop treating Donald Trump like a Republican,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cHe believes in Donald Trump.\u201d \n \nThe debate also featured a robust debate on Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, who jailed for refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her cause was championed in visits by Cruz and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, both vying for the support of social conservatives. \n \nOn that score, Cruz took some flak from Bush, who argued that public officials have to follow the law. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say gays can\u2019t get married,\u201d Bush said. \n \nCruz also took criticism for his willingness to risk a government shutdown over federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides women\u2019s health care, including abortions. Some Republican candidates, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, described a potential government shutdown as a losing cause. \n \nSaid Cruz: \u201cWe need to stop surrendering, and start standing up for our values.\u201d \n \nBut unlike many in the GOP field, Cruz has been loath to criticize Trump, sparing himself the sting of Trump\u2019s return barbs. Some see it as an alliance of convenience for two candidates courting the same ultra-conservative segment of the GOP base. \n \nLeaving nothing to chance, Cruz ran television ads during and after the debate in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. \n \nThe earlier debate also included Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, and George Pataki. Graham, recalling the days when Reagan drank with Democratic leaders to negotiate deals in Congress, promised that if he\u2019s elected president, \u201cWe\u2019re going to drink more.\u201d \n  \nkevin.diaz@chron.com", "source": "San Antonio Express-News.com"}
