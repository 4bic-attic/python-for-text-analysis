Also, damages caused by \"acts of God\" which refers to natural phenomenons, may not be covered by a typical car insurance plan. \n\nWhen shopping for car insurance, drivers should understand that they can customize their coverage plans. For example, a policy can contain several clauses and drivers can purchase additional coverage options. A common auto insurance clause is one that pays liability damage in case the insured collides with another uninsured motorist. \n\nHow to find the right auto insurance policy \n\nOnline brokerage services can help any driver get the best coverage in their area.
