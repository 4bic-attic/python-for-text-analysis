Questis is a financial technology company \u201cremoving the burden of employee\u2019s personal finances from HR and the workplace.\u201d Too often, HR is encumbered with managing distractions related to personal finance, yet they do not have the time, expertise, or tools to do so. Financial HR\u2122 gives a company the ability to help their employees while reducing the overhead cost of each employee. \n\nFinancial HR\u2122 is a SaaS product that provides employees with actionable items for their personal finances. Once the basic steps towards financial improvement have been undertaken, credentialed advisors (holding the Certified Financial Planner\u2122 designation) are available to provide answers to complex financial questions. Employees have a one-stop-shop for all personal financial issues, something that is normally only accessible to wealthy individuals. \n\nFinancial HR\u2122 accomplishes three objectives. First, the HR team is no longer distracted with the personal finance issues of the employees. This frees HR to handle more pressing issues within the company for which they have been trained. Second, since personal financial issues can be very distracting at work, Financial HR reduces employee financial stress, increasing engagement, thereby increasing employee output. Finally, since HR can be held liable for financial advice, using Financial HR pulls the company out of the hot-seat because they know that Questis will handle any questions on the complex topic of personal finances. \n\nIn the American workforce, 76% of employees are living paycheck to paycheck; 31% have zero retirement savings. There is an epidemic of bad finances in the workplace. Of HR professionals, 83% said that personal finance had a negative impact on workplace performance. By offering employees guidance from CFP\u00ae professionals, Financial HR\u2122 is improving the workplace and ultimately changing lives. \n\nAbout Questis \nQuestis - a financial technology firm - creates positive financial habits and outcomes for American workers.
