A couple weeks ago, Discovery Channel announced plans to air the documentary Sherpa to international audiences in 2016. Sherpa tells the tragic story of the disastrous 2014 avalanche on Mount Everest: coincidentally, a team of filmmakers who was on the mountain at the time to film the climbing season from the local sherpas\u2019 perspective ended up capturing the deadly disaster.
