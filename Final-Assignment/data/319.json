And, if you have a PC, your machine runs on a Microsoft operating system. \n\nSound familiar? \n\nIf it does, you\u2019re in luck because the new Windows 10 is finally here and there are plenty of reasons to love this new operating system. \u201cMicrosoft combined the best features of Windows 7 and Windows 8,\u201d says tech guru, Mario Armstrong. Windows 10 has been designed to offer you optimal performance on every device it runs so you can enjoy a Windows 7-like experience when using your computer or a Windows 8 experience on your mobile device. \n\nWindows 10 also offers a free personal assistant, built-in apps, increased photo and map capabilities and all the tools you need to manage your obligations with improved mail and calendar options, along with more opportunities to have some fun with movies, shows and music. \n\nSo how do you transition to Windows 10? It\u2019s easier than you think and to help you through the process, Armstrong offers these tips: \n\n* Back it up. Whether you decide to upgrade your current computer to Windows 10 or to buy a new Windows 10 powered device, it\u2019s always a good idea to take some time and make sure all of your important files have been backed up. Get an external hard drive and use Microsoft\u2019s free Backup and Restore software to copy all of your files over. This way, if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll know everything is safe and sound. \n\n* Trust it to the professionals. Upgrading can be a scary process, since it\u2019s possible to lose files or forget to uninstall certain drivers. Create your own safety net by taking advantage of the Staples EasyTech program and a knowledgeable Staples associate will upgrade your computer to Windows 10 for free. Just call or head into a local store to make an appointment and you\u2019ll be running Windows 10 in no time. Any device running Windows 7 or later is eligible. \n\n* Find the right device for your new operating system. Before you enact a Windows 10 upgrade, you need to figure out if you\u2019ll be upgrading your current computer or transitioning to a new device. The good news is if your current laptop, tablet or hybrid device runs Windows 7 or Windows 8 already, it can probably handle Windows 10\u2019s system requirements, but you should double check to make sure. If your computer barely meets the minimum requirements but runs fine, you should hold off on upgrading until you can afford a new device. Even though Windows 10 is free for most people, adding it to an older device may slow the device down. You can learn more about upgrading for free from Microsoft\u2019s site. \n\nFor PC users, Windows 10 offers them the chance to use and enjoy their devices like never before and upgrading is easy. Simply follow Armstrong\u2019s tips before you upgrade and visit your local Staples store for help. Then, your old companion will have a new and exciting look and feel in no time.", "source": "Tate County Democrat"}
