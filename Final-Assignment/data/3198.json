My name is Alexa Hirschberg and I am a rising sophomore at the University of Delaware! I am super pumped to be starting my first semester being a Style Guru for CollegeFashonista! Fashion and writing have always been passions of mine, so being able bring them together makes this an even more incredible journey. I cannot wait to share all the super trendy outfits I find sported around campus! \n \nFashion has grown to become an important aspect of my life. When I was 14 years old, I started watching YouTube videos online. The videos helped bring my passion for fashion to life. These girls taught me that clothes may make you feel good on the outside but what is on the inside that makes your fashion and self grow. \n \nA little fact about me, is that my style can often be looked at as bohemian . Yes, the vintage and gypsy look is still turning my fashion world upside down! \u00a0I think it sends a calm and collect vibe to those deceitful wandering eyes. My fashion zen is put together in my outfits. Each outfit I put together can be brought to life for a day time look or night time affair. \n \nAccessorizing. One of my favorite parts of any ensemble! From layering necklaces to stacking rings or bracelets, jewelry will forever be a staple piece of mine. Accessories can bring an outfit from zero to ready for the runway in a matter of seconds!\u00a0 \n \nFashion is a way to live. It is the way I express myself without having to explain in words. It was Gianni Versace who said, \u201cDon\u2019t be into trends. Don\u2019t make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live.\u201d\u00a0", "source": "College Fashion Trends and Style Tips"}
