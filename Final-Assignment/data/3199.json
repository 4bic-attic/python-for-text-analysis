So, Svoboda made the decision to take on the challenge himself. \n\n\u201cPeople thought that it was going to be a separate book, and more than 20 people contacted the president of the PTA wanting a copy of the book,\u201d he said. \u201cShe replied, \u2018no, no, no, it\u2019s nothing like that.' So, I contacted her and told her that I wanted to put one together.\u201d \n\nCollaborating with the PTA, former principal Bob Robinson and David Pinkall, executive director of the Fremont Public School foundation, Svoboda started tackling his latest challenge. \n\nThree years later, the 55-page booklet \"Linden Legends\" is complete \u2014 and it\u2019s causing a buzz. Svoboda has sold 37 copies so far, and not only to people in Nebraska. Linden alumnus from New Jersey, Florida, Mississippi, Oregon, Arizona and Illinois have purchased copies.\u00a0 \n\nThe booklet is broken down into numerous sections highlighting different decades, and students\u2019 memories from the time period. Also highlighted are staff members who played crucial roles in students\u2019 lives during the particular decade. \n\nUsing the Internet, primarily a Linden Alumni Facebook page, Svoboda networked with dozens of people who attended the school throughout the years. It seemed that everybody had a story to tell about their experience at the school, he said. \n\nAs it turns, out, he has a few of his own as well. \n\nSvoboda recalls his time in Mrs. Whitcomb\u2019s fifth-grade classroom. She encouraged him to take up puppetry, and even to start a school newspaper. One of his clearest memories is participating in airway drills while the United States was involved with World War ll. At the time, the drills made no sense to young Svoboda.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWe would have to go down these stair cases during the drills,\u201d Svoboda said. \u201cI could never figure out why they were doing this, it\u2019s not like the Japanese were going to be bombing the middle of Nebraska.\" \n \nYears later, though, Svoboda said he learned that the Japanese would tie bombs to balloons and send them overseas \u2014 one actually reached an area around North Omaha dropping into an empty field. \n\n\u201cIt took me more than 60 years to appreciate the drills, it finally answered the question for me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \n\nThe reception toward \"Linden Legends\" has been astounding, but Svoboda isn\u2019t surprised because he said he knows how vested of an interest people have in the schools\u2019 history and success. \n\nUltimately, people enjoy looking back on their days at Linden and remembering all of the good times they had, the bonds they formed and the cherished memories they made. \n\n\u201cIt certainly triggers a lot of great memories for people,\u201d Svoboda said. \u201cI just had one woman order one and she was so excited to get it. She kept saying that she couldn\u2019t wait to get home so that she could turn all those pages full of memories.\u201d \n\n\"Linden Legends\" can be purchased locally for $5, and shipped anywhere in the country for $9.
