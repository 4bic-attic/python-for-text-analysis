As a matter-of-fact, the top-three finishers were all a lap down at one point. Again, in case you missed it, Carl Edwards and Kurt Busch were the two drivers who finished second and third. And by the way, Joe Gibbs Racing are first through fourth in the points standings after one race in the Chase. \n \nWhy am I concered you may have missed the aforementioned news? Because it seems the big news of the weekend was the altercation between reigning champion Kevin Harvick and six-time champ Jimmie Johnson in the driver motorcoach lot. \n \nNASCAR took a stance Monday by announcing that there would be no penalty for either driver for the incident. From that, I take that the incident was no big deal for the sanctioning body. But what about everybody else? Frankly, I think it\u2019s all being blown out of proportion. Heck, tracks hosting Chase races are using it as a promotional took, and quite frankly, exaggerating the incident, in my opinion. Also, headlines on post-race stories Sunday evening seemed to over-sensationalize the whole thing, again, in my opinion. \n \nMatt \u201cSpider Monkey\u201d Kenseth jumping Brad Keselowski between haulers this incident was not. Okay, I admit, I was entertained by that one. \n \nMaybe the coverage and promotions featuring the aforementioned Johnson-Harvick incident is what\u2019s feeding the fan frenzy, the fan frenzy that reached the point that Harvick\u2019s wife, DeLana Harvick, felt the need to take to social media to defend her family. \n \nI\u2019m neither Team Harvick nor Team Johnson in this matter. I\u2019m Team Let\u2019s Just Move On. To entities using this incident as a promo tool \u2014 is this how we really want to promote the sport? Shouldn\u2019t good racing be enough? Sure, I\u2019m all for drivers not being vanilla, instead showing emotion and telling us how they really feel, but when it comes to promoting the sport, maybe the on-track product should be the focus. \n  \nThe marketing focus on altercations \u2014 and by altercations, I\u2019m NOT talking on-track rivalries \u2014 maybe contributes to the image of NASCAR being some kind of \u201cgood \u2018ol boy redneck\u201d sport. Did you ever think of that? Maybe that\u2019s why some mainstream sports folks don\u2019t take NASCAR seriously. Ever think of that? Do we want NASCAR in the same conversation as the WWE? \n \nThere are on-the-court, field, etc. altercations in other professional sports, but that\u2019s not the focus of marketing efforts by the sanctioning bodies of said sports. I don\u2019t recall seeing shoving-match-filled commercials promoting the NBA Finals a few months ago. \n \nAnd while I\u2019m the subject of this Johnson vs. Harvick thing, I\u2019m thinking headlines that include \u201cpunches thrown\u201d is a little inaccurate. Wasn\u2019t Harvick\u2019s action more like a closed-fist shove? But I digress. \n \nLet\u2019s just focus on the racing and actually pay attention to that annoying line from that even more annouing song, \u201cLet it go.\u201d \n \nFollow Auto Racing Daily on Twitter @AutoRacingDaily or like Auto Racing Daily on Facebook (facebook.com/autorcngdaily).
