I hope that if the Red Sox beat Archer again, they don't celebrate too much and hurt his feelings.\nAlex Speier of the Globe notes that Rodriguez's 1.68 ERA in night games this year \"is the lowest since at least 1914 by a Red Sox pitcher who has made 10 or more night starts in a season, besting Pedro\u2019s 1.82 mark in his outrageous 1999 season.\"\nNote: I know you have to add that \"since at least 1914\" qualifier when using Baseball Reference's Play Index, but there were absolutely no night games before 1914, so in this case you can say \"in Red Sox history\" and be completely safe!\nAlso: Yankees at Blue Jays. Toronto leads the East by 2.5 games.", "source": "the joy of sox"}
