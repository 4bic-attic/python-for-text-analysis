I attended one lecture about *Garbage Can Quilts*. \u00a0I was hoping to get more ideas to use up scraps but the lecturer follows Bonnie Hunter's Scrap System and showed a few of her Bonnie quilts.\nI'm afraid I didn't support the vendors very well with this trip. I only came away with a bottle of oil for the long arm, some clover wonder clips and the Quilt Expo 2015 t*shirt. I was looking for the Walk-About pattern but I guess, I will need to order it online.\nThe quilts in the show were beautiful, as always. They are way above my skill level but I do admire the beauty with every stitch.\n:)", "source": "Bell Creek Quilts"}
