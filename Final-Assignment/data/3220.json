Even so, after last year\u2019s launch for Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity was infamously riddled with bugs and glitches, fans are hoping for more concerted efforts by the studio to ensure Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate is up to snuff before it goes live. \n\nUbisoft has addressed the issues surrounding previous entries in the series, saying that they learned from Unity. Bearing that in mind, it\u2019s important for the developers to provide a rock solid release with the forthcoming sequel should they wish to retain the franchise\u2019s fan base, while also expanding their audience at the same time. To put it succinctly, Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate\u2018s technical aspects and narrative threads need to be airtight if the franchise is to survive and thrive. \n\nSpeaking of plot, Ubisoft has given fans a taste of Syndicate\u2018s tale with previous footage, such as the game\u2019s cinematic trailer revealed at E3 2015 a few months back, which mostly focused on the general tone of the environment, revealing a gloomy 1868 industrial London setting. Now, the studio is offering up a brand new video that emphasizes the league of enemies of which the title\u2019s dual protagonists and two playable characters \u2013 Jacob and Evie Frye \u2013 must bring down on behalf of the working class in order to save the city from falling into rampant corruption. \n\nAs seen in the above clip, the twin assassins certainly have their work cut out for them, as the head of London\u2019s Templar order, Crawford Starrick, has seven separate henchmen in his employ, all of whom have their hands in the city\u2019s most prominent honeypots and industries holding up society. Making up the cast of villains, there\u2019s the ruthless industrialist Rupert Ferris, the money-grubbing transportation tycoon Pearl Attaway, the mad doctor duo of John Elliotso\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
