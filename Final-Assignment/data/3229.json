Public Schools Kaya Henderson  \nPR Newswire \n \nNEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2015 \n   \nNEW YORK , Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- SiriusXM today announced An American Conversation \u2013 We Are All Americans, an ongoing series focused on the need for a national dialogue about race in America. Urban View host Joe Madison (\"The Black Eagle\") will moderate the series, which will feature additional Sirius XM hosts in subsequent editions, and journey to locations around the country to facilitate this national conversation.\u00a0 \n \nThe first installment, hosted from SiriusXM's Washington, D.C. headquarters, will be a roundtable discussion on a hotly debated topic in the news: the school to prison pipeline. The panel will feature leading experts from the worlds of education and politics, including U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ; Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.); Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, Kaya Henderson ; Chief Judge, U.S. District Court, Richard Roberts ; and many more. \n\nMadison will lead the panelists in an in-depth conversation that focuses on improving the conditions that have contributed to pushing predominantly minority youth into the prison system. The special will debut exclusively on SiriusXM's Urban View channel 126 on Friday, October 9 th at 7:00am ET and replay multiple times throughout the weekend.\u00a0( Friday October 9 th at 8pm-Midnight ET ; Saturday October 10 th at 4-6pm ET ; Sunday October 11 th at 3-7pm , and 10pm-Midnight ET ). \n\nThe American Conversation series will continue to air throughout the year and into 2016, tackling numerous issues related to race which are critical to Americans of all backgrounds. Inspired by conversations happening within households across the country, An American Conversation aims to raise awareness about underreported issues and find actionable solutions to the problems the country faces. \n\n\" Joe Madison is kicking off a series of candid conversations with the leaders of our nation and our communities,\" said Scott Greenstein , President and Chief Content Officer, SiriusXM. \"Radio can do more than entertain and Joe is more than just a host behind a mic. He regularly travels across America to hear directly from his listeners, encouraging them to have their voices heard. This is just the start of a series where all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation, can learn from one another and lead our nation forward.\" \n \nThe notion of not just debating serious topics, but also working with others to find solutions, aligns with Madison's lifelong passion. An activist who at just 24 was named Executive Director of the 10,000 member Detroit NAACP chapter, Madison is now a broadcaster who readily dives into the thick of the debate, making him the perfect voice for An American Conversation . On his daily SiriusXM program Joe Madison The Black Eagle (M-F, 6am-10am ET ), Joe's signature question to his audience is \"What are you going to do about it?\" \u00a0He'll now continue that mission with An American Conversation. \n\nAbout SiriusXM \n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc.
