Joshua J. Silva, 38, of 26 Oak St., New Bedford, is charged with murder and armed robbery in the Oct. 14, 2013, death of Joyce N. Howland, whose body was found inside her Hamlet Street home shortly before noon on Oct. 15, 2013. Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Thomas M. Quinn III's office, said the jury was picked shortly before 1 p.m. Monday in Fall River Superior Court. Opening arguments are scheduled to start at 9 a.m. Tuesday. The trial is expected to last about a week and a view by the jury is also scheduled. Judge Robert J. Kane is presiding at the trial.\u00a0 According to court documents, Silva was an employee of Fairhaven Lumber, and he and another worker had insulated the attic of Howland's home on Oct. 11, 2013. Court documents say that jewelry was stolen from Howland's home and later given to \"third parties\" who pawned the items in New Bedford. Prosecutors have said the killing was especially brutal. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Driscoll said at Silva's arraignment in New Bedford District Court in October 2013 that the victim's throat was slit and her spine was fractured. Howland's body was found by a friend about 11 a.m. on Oct. 15, 2013, lying face down in her bedroom on a blood-soaked rug, according to court records.
