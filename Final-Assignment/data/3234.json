We\u2019re getting a very fine, unique measurement of the uppermost surface,\u201d Petro told AFP.\n\nMonday\u2019s \u201cblood moon\u201d will be the last in a string of four total lunar eclipses since April 15, 2014, in a series astronomers call a tetrad. \n\nThese phenomena may be a normal part of the celestial calendar today, but for many ancient peoples it was an omen of bad things to come.\n\n\u201cThroughout history many cultures have seen (eclipses) as being a sign of gloom and doom,\u201d Petro said.\n\nThey weren\u2019t always wrong.\n\nIn February 1504, explorer Christopher Columbus used a blood moon to trick Jamaican natives who had been feeding him and his men, but cut them off when relations turned sour.\n\nColumbus knew a blood moon had been forecast, and warned the natives that his god would send an angry \u201csign\u201d at their treatment of the newcomers.\n\nLegend has it the natives came running with food as soon as the Moon turned red.\n\nUnlike a solar eclipse, which creates the impression of a bright \u201cring\u201d of light as the Moon passes before our star, there is no danger in watching Monday\u2019s lunar spectacle with the naked eye, the experts say.\n\n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "South Coast Herald"}
