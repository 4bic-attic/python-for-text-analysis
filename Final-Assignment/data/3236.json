(TXT) business, announced today a $56.2 million firm-fixed-price contract from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, Mich., to supply 55 additional COMMANDO\u2122 Select four-wheeled armored vehicles to the Afghan National Army (ANA). \n\nThe vehicles are being contracted through the U.S. Army Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process. Work will be performed in Slidell, La., with vehicle deliveries beginning in October 2015 and completing by February 2016.\n\nThis latest FMS order of COMMANDO Select vehicles for the ANA will be configured in three variants: 36 equipped with Objective Gunner Protection Kits; 15 with enclosed 40mm/.50 caliber turrets; and four ambulance vehicles. \n\nCalled Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV) by the ANA, these vehicles will be deployed in support of security operations throughout the country. More than 630 of these vehicles have been delivered to the ANA since 2012.\n\n\"Since being put into service by Afghan National Army Kandaks (battalions) several years ago, ANA soldiers have experienced the exceptional mobility, survivability and overall performance these vehicles are known for,\" said Tom Walmsley, Marine & Land Systems senior vice president and general manager. \"This additional supply of vehicles will support Kandaks currently operating MSFVs, so that existing ANA vehicle inventory can be rotated in for regular service and maintenance work.\" \n\nRigorously tested and proven in the toughest environments, the COMMANDO family of vehicles -- including Elite, Select and Advanced lines -- offers a range of protection options, unmatched on-road/off-road mobility and ample firepower.
