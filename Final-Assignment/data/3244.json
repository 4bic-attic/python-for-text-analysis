Papelbon also dropped his appeal of the three-game ban levied by Major League Baseball for throwing in the head area of Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday.\u00a0 The two suspensions combined will end Papelbon\u2019s season. The Nationals play only seven more games, beginning with Monday\u2019s make-up game against the Cincinnati Reds.\u00a0 \"The behavior exhibited by Papelbon yesterday is not acceptable,\" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said in a prepared statement released by the team. \"That is not at all in line with the way our players are expected to conduct themselves, and the Nationals organization will not tolerate it in any way.\"", "source": "Phillies Zone"}
