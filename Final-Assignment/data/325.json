Also, HDTV reviews (12%) were cited by many shoppers as relevant factors to consider during the purchasing process. \n\n\"We continue to see more consumers turning to the Internet to find the best HDTV deals,\" said Brian Meyer , President of Shopping Nexus.\u00a0 \"The majority of those we polled start their searches online (as opposed to shopping in a brick and mortar store). While many (34%) turn to Amazon.com or other online retailers first, a sizeable percentage (17%) utilizes an online comparison website, such as ShoppingNexus.com.\" \n\nWhile brand was cited by 28% of consumers as the most important determining factor when purchasing an HDTV, few (7%) describe themselves as \"very brand loyal.\" It seems that the majority (58%) of respondents prefer to shop for the best price among a select group of household brand names. \n \nIn addition to sharing opinions about HD flat panel technology, participants were also asked about \"curved\" HD televisions.
