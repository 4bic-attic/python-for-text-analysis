This brings the total investment made by Sky in Jaunt since 2013 to $1.65 million. \n\nBased in California's Silicon Valley, Jaunt leads the industry through its unrivalled end-to-end solution for creating and distributing premium live action VR. The content can be played on a wide variety of devices, including common smartphones, as well as VR goggles like Facebook's Oculus Rift. The technology delivers a highly immersive experience, enabling viewers to enjoy a truly 360 degree stereoscopic view, where audiences are placed -- literally -- at the centre of the action. It's the world's most immersive omnidirectional VR experience. \n     \nSince Sky's initial investment, the two companies have tested the technology on a number of Sky original productions, including Critical, Penny Dreadful, Trollied, Fortitude and Got to Dance, as well as sports including boxing and motor racing. Sky has also worked with Jaunt and Warner Bros to create cinematic VR clips from The Hobbit set and red carpet London premiere in 2014. \n\nOver the next 12 months, Sky will work with Jaunt to film even more original virtual reality content. \n\nThe additional funding for Jaunt is part of Sky's ongoing programme of investing in innovative startups that help Sky bring new ideas, insight and services into its business. This follows recent investments in leading online sports network Whistle Sports, Pluto.TV, the online video aggregator and the US ad tech firm Sharethrough. Sky has previously invested in a number of other pioneering US technology companies, including the IP streaming service provider Roku and the OTT video delivery firm, 1 Mainstream. \n\nFurther details of our investments and Sky's US office can be found here. \n\nStuart Murphy, Director of Entertainment, Sky commented: \n\"Jaunt are the pioneers of Cinematic VR.
