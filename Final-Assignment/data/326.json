But are you encouraging or hindering your child's success? Here are 10 habits you may not realize are damaging to his or her success in school. 1. Forget about tomorrow morning. Let her stay up late! It\u2019s not like she needs a full nights\u2019 rest to do well in school; she can sleep in her desk! Besides, she hates bedtime and it\u2019s so much easier to let her stay up with you and watch some of those funny late night television shows. 2. Don\u2019t ask her about her homework every day or how school is going. You don\u2019t want to be a nag. She\u2019s probably got it all figured out and will get great grades without your getting involved. 3. Don\u2019t worry about grades until a week or two before they come out. You have plenty of time! Your schedule is too busy anyway to be bogged down with your child\u2019s education. If she misses class or a few assignments here and there, the teacher will gladly accept them until the last day of the term and if he doesn\u2019t, you can just call the principal and she\u2019ll sort it all out. 4. Yell at your child until she gets her homework done. Ground her and take away her cell phone. That\u2019s how you really get someone motivated to work hard. If she complains, tell her you walked to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes; she\u2019ll quickly realize that she\u2019s being ungrateful and get right to work. 5. Don\u2019t worry about attending Parent-Teacher Conference. That teacher couldn\u2019t have anything helpful to say about how she is doing in his class. After all, what did he do with his life? He\u2019s just a teacher. He better just shape up and do what you say, after all; you\u2019re the parent and you pay taxes. 6. Whenever she has a doctor or dentist appointment, be sure to make that appointment during her hardest class. It will give her a much needed break and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re worried about her making up the work. That\u2019s the teacher\u2019s problem, not yours. 7. Don\u2019t worry about whether your child has breakfast before she heads to school. School is early enough; it\u2019s not worth getting up earlier to make breakfast. Besides, it\u2019s not like learning is a bodily function; it\u2019s more of a brain function. Page 2 of 2 - 8. Don\u2019t praise your child if she does something well in school; it will just go to her head. Your job is to motivate her by pointing out only the things she does wrong. After all, if you don\u2019t say it, who will? 9. If you have a complaint, always go straight to the top! Principals love to get involved in every little situation; that\u2019s why they\u2019re called princi-\u201cpals.\u201d 10. Don\u2019t worry about setting a good example of continued learning. You already went to school! Been there, done that. You have too much work to do now to fit in reading a good book or showing your child that you still love art. Never talk about what inspired you to get where you are today; that will just bore her.", "source": "Canton Repository"}
