My story helps to explain.\nI was shaped as a young white southerner in the 1960s by my family's involvement in the \"civil rights\" movement. I also agree with Martin Luther King's friend Vincent Harding, who said in Hope and History, \"civil rights movement is too narrow a description...in fact [the movement] was a\u00a0What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week:", "source": "Big Education Ape"}
