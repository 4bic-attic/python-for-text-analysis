The former Optus executive is well-regarded for his industry knowledge but Canberra sources say a Ministerial role would probably be too much of a leap at this early stage.\n\nMs Payne is well regarded by Mr Turnbull and a moderate liberal and has also proved she can collaborate with the right of the party by working closely with Minister for Social Services, Scott Morrison, on the government's IT overhaul at Centrelink.\n\nSenator Simon Birmingham is also reportedly in line for an elevation to the Cabinet and has experience of the communications portfolio from his position on relevant Senate committees.\n\nOther names touted for the role include Health Minister Sussan Ley and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Steve Ciobo, as well as Senator Arthur Sinodinos, according to Comms Day, which raised the possibility that Mr Turnbull may split the portfolio into NBN and \"general media/comms\" ministries.
