It\u2019ll never work. You should just give up. Here\u2019s the story of a man who wouldn\u2019t listen to all those voices and just pursued his dream anyway. I think that\u2019s an inspiring story worth telling.\u201d \n \nPetit\u2019s 1,300 foot high crossing between the towers was unauthorised; he and a group of friends spent months planning how to pull it off. \n \nIn the end, Petit walked between the buildings eight times over a matter of 45 minutes. Charges against him were filed but were eventually dropped by the city. \n \nThe 66-year old stuntman came to the aid of Levitt, acting as the actor\u2019s teacher for the movie. \n \n\u201cHe, in fact, insisted on being the one to teach me how to walk on a high wire and, not everyone who is good at something is also good at teaching it, and he\u2019s actually a fantastic teacher.\u201d \n \nPetit said their training was intensive, but that Levitt was a fast learner. \n \n\u201cThe Walk\u201d opens in US theatres on\u00a0September\u00a030. \u2014 Reuters", "source": "Malay Mail"}
