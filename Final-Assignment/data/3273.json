Aside from directly steering the last two decades of New York hip-hop, his drums and crates can be heard rattling on the other coast and overseas, making him one of the most celebrated and influential beatsmiths in the genre\u2019s history. But there comes a time when every creative soul gets restless. And so the living half of Gang Starr has decided to grapple with a new challenge. Where some producers push themselves into new genres as a way to test their skills, Preemo is recreating sounds he\u2019s crafted before\u2013only this time, with a live band. Today (Sept. 8), Preemo dropped the first single from by new band, DJ Premier and the Badder, over at\u00a0 Rolling Stone . Called \u201cBpatter,\u201d the new cut gets the black-and-white video treatment for its vibrant horns, its biting drums and for Preemo\u2019s barked vocals. One can\u2019t help but feel it hits the sweet spot between departure and comfort food.", "source": "XXL"}
