Our definition of success truly depends on our individual goals. For example, your goal might be monetary, a physical accomplishment or a moral achievement. To flesh out this topic, we are adding a few comments made by famous and successful people in diverse fields - similar and familiar concepts to those put forward by the Premier Experts\u00ae in this book. \n\nSuccess is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed. ~ Booker T. Washington \n\nYou can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. ~ Napoleon Hill \n\nThe difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will. ~ Vince Lombardi \n\nNothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude. ~ Thomas Jefferson \n\nIn our New Economy, the acquisition of success has been reformatted somewhat by business and industry even though its principles remain the same. The Electronic Revolution has changed the economic landscape as much as the Industrial Revolution. We now live more and more in \"real time\" and expect others to do the same. This era of instant communication has changed the ways in which we communicate and expect responses. \n\nTo succeed today, it is useful, perhaps essential, to have a mentor. Errors will be made, but to minimize them will speed up your journey. The Premier Experts\u00ae in this book will help you along the way. They have been there and know the road. Who would be better to guide you? They will illuminate your path to The Soul Of Success... \n\nAfter such a successful release, David Ruggieri will be recognized by The National Academy of Best-Selling Authors\u2122 , an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists. \n\nClick HERE to order a copy of The Soul of Success \n\nA portion of the royalties earned from The Soul of Success will be given to Entrepreneur\u2019s International Foundation, a not for profit organization dedicated to creating unique launch campaigns to raise money and awareness for charitable causes. \n\nMore About David Ruggieri: \n\nOver the years David has been in front of thousands of people \u201cspreading the word\u201d on personal power and personal responsibility.
