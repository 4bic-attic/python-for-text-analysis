Nimr is facing a death sentence handed down when he was 17 and is largely based on a \u201cconfession\u201d he was forced to sign following what he says were days of torture while in custody. The sentence will be carried out in jail by the Saudi prison service. Corbyn called on the British government to protest against this sentence by dropping its bid for a \u00a35.9m contract to provide prison expertise to the Saudis.\nThe bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ that was set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling, to sell its expertise in prisons and probation \u2013 including in offender management, payment by results, tagging and privatisation \u2013 around the world. Last month the new justice secretary, Michael Gove announced that he was closing down JSI, telling MPs it was because \u201cof the need to focus departmental resources on domestic priorities\u201d. But Gove said the bid for the Saudi contract to provide \u201ctraining-needs analysis\u201d would go ahead because it is so far advanced that the financial penalties for cancellation would be detrimental to the British government\u2019s interests. \u201cAll work relating to this contract will be completed within six months of starting,\u201d he said. The official explanation was later amended to exclude the issue of financial penalties, and a correction made to the parliamentary record. But the justice ministry still says that it would not be in the \u201cwider interests of the British government\u201d to withdraw the bid at this late stage. This is taken by campaigners, such as Reprieve, to mean that the Foreign Office is insisting it goes ahead. In a statement last Friday, the FCO said: \u201cWe understand that Ali Mohammed al-Nimr\u2019s legal process has finished and his final appeal has been denied. We will raise this case urgently with the Saudi authorities.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cThe abolition of the death penalty is a human rights priority for the UK. The UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances.\u201d\nDowning Street said the UK had already raised Nimr\u2019s case with the Saudi authorities and Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, would raise it again with his Saudi counterpart. The initial JSI bid to the Saudi authorities for the contract was made in August 2014 with a final bid being submitted this April. It is subject to final approval by the Saudi ministry of finance. Maya Foa, of the anti-death penalty group Reprive, wrote to Gove asking him to drop the bid. She said: \u201cBritain\u2019s justice system has a strong reputation for fairness and decency and we believe that to continue with this contract would sully that reputation, while sending the signal that Britain condones the abuses taking place in the Saudi system, and others like it around the world.\u201d", "source": "UK news | The Guardian"}
