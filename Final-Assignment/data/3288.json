His thoughts? Elba is \"too street\" to play the legendary spy, Horowitz tells Britain's Daily Mail . \"For me, Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part,\" Horowitz says. \"It's not a color issue. I think he is probably a bit too 'street' for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah.\" Perhaps Horowitz, who cites Casino Royale as his favorite Bond film and describes Skyfall  as \"the one Bond film I have never liked,\" has seen one too many episodes of The Wire , in which Elba played iconic drug lord Stringer Bell. Idris Elba responds to James Bond speculation in the most perfect way \"Idris Elba is a terrific actor, but I can think of other black actors who would do it better,\" Horowitz adds, citing Hustle star Adrian Lester as an example. Horowitz's Bond book, titled Trigger Mortis (groan), is set in 1957, two weeks after the events in Goldfinger , according to the Daily Mail . It also marks the return of Bond girl Pussy Galore - who ditches Bond in favor of a lesbian tryst - and the introduction of a new female character, Jeopardy Lane. It is scheduled to be published on Sept. 8. What do you think of Horowitz's comments? Will you read Trigger Mortis ? Other Links From TVGuide.com", "source": "Corning Leader"}
