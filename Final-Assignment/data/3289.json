The company will also look to launch the 360fly platform across other DEFY brand channels in the coming year, as well as leveraging 360fly digital products for its original studio production and programming. \n\n360fly's interactive 360-degree video player technology provides viewers a 360 x 240-degree field of view. Viewers can literally immerse themselves within the video through touch-screen technology, clicking, dragging or swiping on any mobile device, as well as through motion-sensor technology by which the movement of the device itself controls the interactive experience of the video. With desktops and laptops, this interactivity is achieved through the use of the mouse, clicking and dragging the video to see and experience different vantage points within the larger 360 x 240-degree field of view. \"The introduction of interactive 360-degree video is truly a game-changer, opening the door to an entirely new universe of innovative interactive and virtual reality content experiences for our viewers and internal content creators,\" said Keith Richman \n\nThe collaboration is a valuable one for 360fly as it pushes forward in its mission to drive widespread mainstream acceptance, production and consumption of interactive 360-degree video, while also democratizing virtual reality through a platform that's dramatically more accessible and feasible for mainstream consumers. To date, consumption of virtual reality has been a very costly proposition, requiring the use of much higher-priced equipment and limited to a small array of virtual reality content. In combination with affordable cardboard virtual reality goggles, 360fly is opening the door for consumers to produce, consume and share virtual reality experiences at a moment's notice. \n\n\"Affordable cameras and viewing devices are only part of the equation. The final piece is consumers having access to a robust ecosystem of destinations where they can readily consume a wide range of 360-degree virtual reality content,\" said Peter Adderton \n\nTo learn more about 360fly, visit www.360fly.com or follow 360fly on Twitter and Instagram @360fly, and \"like\" it on Facebook at facebook.com/360fly.
