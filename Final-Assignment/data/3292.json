I love all these different trends and disruptions and turmoil. I  especially love the confusion - it gives me something to write about. \n \nBut sometimes, I've just had enough. Especially when the digital disruption story starts repeating itself. \n \nTake, for example, the unicorn meme. Unicorn, as in  a VC-funded startup with a billion-dollar-plus valuation. You know, the  Ubers and AirBnBs and Facebooks of the world. \n \nIt seems that every presentation, every talk, every  press release compares whatever some DigiCloudDataTech startup is doing  with Uber. Or AirBnB. Or Facebook. Like you'd ever come up with Uber.  Or AirBnB. Or Facebook. Hearing about Uber or AirBnB or Facebook just one more time is going to make me pull what's left of my hair out - and I still have most of my hair. \n \nUnicorns aren't rare, folks. They're mythical . As in nonexistent. So stop talking about them already! \n \nAnd then there's digital marketing. Marketing, of  course, is an important part of the digital story, since digital is  customer-driven and marketing is supposed to be expert on everything  customer-driven. \n \nBut if you look at what the digital marketers are  doing, it seems that they've all reached a plateau where they're all  doing the same stuff. And a lot of it simply sucks. \n \nTake retargeting ,  for example. Retargeting is where you look at some widget on some site  somewhere, and then for the next three weeks ads for that stupid widget  follow you everywhere online. Look up one of those super-realistic digital Japanese robotic sex toys ? You'll get nothing but ads for sex toys on every damn web site you visit. Better hope your mom doesn't come over. \n \nThe problem with retargeting, of course, is that  the marketers really have no clue whatsoever if you're really in the  market for that sex toy. Perhaps you already bought one. Or maybe you  just thought that toy was hot and had to click through to see if there  were more sexy photos of it. The marketers simply have no freaking idea. \n \nIt gets worse. What about digitalwashing ? You know, like cloudwashing ,  where people pretended to do cloud because it was cool. Now digital is  cool so people are digitizing this and that, in hopes of a cushy seat on  the bandwagon. \n \nHow do you tell digitalwashing from the real thing? Try replacing the word digital with either of the words web or ebusiness and see if it's something someone might have said back when we were partying like it was 1999 . \n \nAnd what's up with cybersecurity, anyway? Welcome to the 2010s, hackers, it's your decade! We have no freaking clue how to keep you out ,  so go ahead and hack us. We probably won't even notice. Here are our  credit card numbers. Have fun with all those iPads and Rolexes and  Japanese sex toys you're going to order. \n \nThe hacking problem has gotten so bad that the Chinese are complaining that we're complaining too much about how much the Chinese are hacking  us. Go ahead, read that sentence again. You can't make this stuff up. \n \nDigital transformation, of course, is more about the transformation than the digital . As in business transformation. As in, you need to reorganize everybody and run your  entire business differently in order to be digitally transformed.  Simple. \n \nWell, good luck with that. About as far as anyone is really getting with their digital transformation initiatives is putting a marketing person on the dev team, or maybe putting a  developer on the marketing team. Paste your favorite Dilbert cartoon  here, seriously. \n \nOh, and what about the management consultants ?  You know, those highly paid MBAs who love to string together buzzwords  into preformatted tomes of advice, only to sell them for a few mil to  unsuspecting executives who will skim them, nod their heads, and go back  to whatever they were doing? \n \nWell, the consultants are all digital now. Every  last one of them. Giving management advice to managers for how to be  digital visionaries and drive their visions down the throat of their  rank and file. After all, look at Uber! And AirBnB! And Facebook! You  can be a unicorn too, Mr. Insurance Executive or Ms. Banker. Self-organization is the key to innovation , so tell all your people to self-organize or get the hell out. \n \nMaybe the industry analysts will help? Not a chance. Gartner is recommending that you should go fast and slow at the same time . Fast as in all digital and DevOps, slow as in all that creaky old IT. Both. At the same time. \n \nCIOs can breathe a sigh of relief - according to  Gartner, this digital stuff is easier than they thought. No monkeying  with all those arcane IT governance policies and mind-numbing procedures  and legacy spaghetti. Just hire some Goths and Lumbersexuals and put them in charge of the new gear and you're off and running. \n \nThe Intellyx Take \nHear that noise? That's the music for this big  digital game of musical chairs we're all playing. There's so much  activity, so much vendor hype, so much enterprise spending, so much VC  investment today that it seems this whole digital extravaganza is never  going to stop. So round and round we go. \n \nWell, I hate to break it to all you digital-native  millennials reading this, but what comes up must come down. For all you  old fogies like me who played our first game of dot.com musical chairs  back in the 1990s, we've heard this music before. Take my advice: make  sure you have a chair when the music stops. \n \nIntellyx advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives and helps  vendors communicate their agility stories. As of the time of writing,  none of the organizations mentioned in this article are Intellyx  customers.

As president of Intellyx, Mr. Bloomberg brings his years of thought leadership in the areas of Cloud Computing, Enterprise Architecture, and Service-Oriented Architecture to a global clientele of business executives, architects, software vendors, and Cloud service providers looking to achieve technology-enabled business agility across their organizations and for their customers.

He is one of the original Managing Partners of ZapThink LLC, the leading SOA advisory and analysis firm, which was acquired by Dovel Technologies in 2011. He now runs the successor to the LZA program, the Bloomberg Agile Architecture Course , around the world. \n\nMr. Bloomberg is a frequent conference speaker and prolific writer. He has published over 500 articles, spoken at over 300 conferences, Webinars, and other events, and has been quoted in the press over 1,400 times as the leading expert on agile approaches to architecture in the enterprise. \n\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s previous book, Service Orient or Be Doomed! How Service Orientation Will Change Your Business (John Wiley & Sons, 2006, coauthored with Ron Schmelzer), is recognized as the leading business book on Service Orientation. He also co-authored the books XML and Web Services Unleashed (SAMS Publishing, 2002), and Web Page Scripting Techniques (Hayden Books, 1996). \n\nPrior to ZapThink, Mr. Bloomberg built a diverse background in eBusiness technology management and industry analysis, including serving as a senior analyst in IDC\u2019s eBusiness Advisory group, as well as holding eBusiness management positions at USWeb/CKS (later marchFIRST) and WaveBend Solutions (now Hitachi Consulting). \n    \n@MicroservicesExpo Stories \n\nBy Felix Xavier \nAt the outset, Hyper convergence looks to be an attractive option seemingly providing lot of flexibility.

Saving performance testing for a \u201cfinal sprint\u201d before release still treats it like a waterfall development step, with all the cost and risk that comes with that.
