In many cases, the first impression a person makes on another, be it for a job, a first date or meeting the in-laws, has much to do with the appearance of their teeth and the quality of smile which goes with it. For this reason, the US -- and California in particular -- have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cosmetic dental procedures in recent years. And while research shows most employers consider a person's smile to be an extremely important part of the appearance, from a psychological standpoint, whiter teeth and a bright smile convey trust. \n \nAccording to Santa Rosa Dentist Mark S. Frey, DDS , major changes are not always needed to improve a person's appearance or feelings about themselves. Says Frey, \"Even a subtle change in a smile helps to project an image of self-confidence and high personal esteem. When a person feels good about themselves, it shows in their appearance. While the first procedure most people think of is teeth whitening, there are a number of other procedures someone can use to improve their smile.\" \n \nMark S. Frey, DDS , a local general, family, and cosmetic dentist in Santa Rosa for 20 years, says technology has improved significantly in recent years allowing a great deal more than good oral health. Dr. Frey explains, saying, \"Although our primary mission is always better oral health, cosmetic dentistry goes well beyond this. We recognize that restored confidence in one's smile and appearance can be beneficial to patients as well. We are here to help individuals not only achieve proper oral health and hygiene, but also to provide a long-lasting positive impression on the people in their lives. This goal is aligned with our ongoing mission to remain Santa Rosa's Best Family and Cosmetic Dentist .\" \n \nFor many patients he's seen in his two decades of practice, comments Dr. Frey, the goal of achieving a beautiful smile comes at a price of overcoming their fear of dentists. \"We understand that sometimes the fear of going to the dentist may prevent patients from seeking out proper oral care and maintenance. To help with this, we offer an oral conscious sedation option to patients.\" This type of treatment is especially helpful for those who require a great deal of work done in a short period of time, says Frey. \"Oral conscious sedation can be a life-changing opportunity to receive the dental care needed, or the smile that you've always been hoped for.\" \n \nAbout Mark S.
