Additionally, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens contributes vocals to two songs. The album's title comes from the 1986 film Parting Glances in which Steve Buscemi portrays a gay man navigating the difficulties of being in a relationship in Reagan-era New York. More than just identifying with the story, Schneit is interested in the in the lasting effect of the parting glances we share with strangers in our everyday encounters. She explains \"You see all sorts of physical and emotional traits on the train. From people puking, making out, screaming, crying, laughing, dancing, grooming, etc. We encounter each other in the thick of our complex lives by simply looking at each other all the time. These glances are mundane and fleeting but also powerfully intimate.\" The lingering impact of those brief moments seeps into the details and imagery she delivers with energizing hooks and a disarming lack of pretense on Parting Glances.\nTURBOBIT\nor\nHITFILE\nor\nNITROFLARE\nAir Waves - Parting Glances (2015) - High Speed Download\r0\r0 voted Torrents search, please wait\rYou may also like: Steve Kuhn : Life\u2019s Backward Glances\u2013Solo and Quartet (2008)  FlacNightnoise - The Parting Tide (1990)Bad Habits - Parting Words [EP] (2013)Steve Khan - Parting Shot (2011) 320kbpsAt Daybreak - A Boxed Diorama Of The Parting Seas [EP](2010)Steve Kuhn - Life's Backward Glances (2008) Information\rWould you like to leave your comment?
