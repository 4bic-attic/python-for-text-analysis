Posted: 02 Sep 2015 02:58 PM PDT Shutdowns, rent cuts as retail blues bite Several luxury goods and jewelry retailers along with sellers of less upmarket items are scaling back in Hong Kong as fewer tourist arrivals eat into profits. Those who remain are winning steep rental cuts from landlords.\nShoe-seller Belle International (1880) closed the last of the seven Belle outlets in Hong Kong on Monday, Ming Pao reported, citing slim business.\nMeanwhile, Emperor Watch & Jewellery (0887) has decided to give up in October its store on the ground floor of the Emperor Watch & Jewellery Centre on Russell Street, Causeway Bay, which boasts some of the world's highest retail rents. The site will be leased to local cosmetic chain Bonjour (0653) at a steep 42 percent discount.\nThe rent for the 3,068-square-foot space will plunge to HK$1.6 million a month from the current HK$2.76 million.\nThe government revealed on Monday that mainland visitor numbers slumped 9.8 percent in July from a year back.\nSun Hung Kai Properties (0016) leasing manager Henry Lam Ka-keung said sales value of jewels and watches at the developer's malls have this year dived 7-8 percent from a year back.\nThe developer opened the first phase of its Yuen Long retail complex Yoho Mall yesterday, and Lam said as the shopping arcades target local consumers, there is only mild impact on business.\nSource: The Standard ASIA, OCEANIA & AFRICA: Data, News & Commentaries :: Boredom Strikes! 05 (Jul 11 - Dec ...

Posted: 02 Sep 2015 05:22 AM PDT This Indirect Indicator Tells You How Dire China's Economic Situation Really Is By Valentin Schmid\nForget about the purchasing managers surveys, which tell you industrial activity in China is grinding to a complete halt. Not 7 percent growth, not 6 percent growth\u2014zero growth.\nLombard Street Chief Economist Says Chinese Economy Actually Contracted in First Quarter\nOk, let's not completely forget about them. The official survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing for August declined to 49.7 from 50, which signals recession. Another representative survey done by Caixin declined to 47.3, the lowest level since 2009 or the depth of the great recession.\nHowever, the real interesting data about China came out of Korea on Tuesday, Sept. 1. The South East Asian powerhouse reported a complete collapse in trading activity. Exports in August crashed 14.7 percent compared to a year earlier and imports declined 18.3 percent.\nThe country still logged a positive trade balance of $4.3 billion, but this figure is shrinking fast\u2014not very surprising given the collapsing volume of trade.\nSince a quarter of Korean exports go to China, the figure is representative of the slowdown within the Chinese economy. Exports to China are down 8.8 percent over the year, despite a rise of 12 percent in the Chinese yuan over the same period. The stronger currency made imports cheaper and should have spurred demand for Korean products, but it didn't. So even as China's balance of trade shrinks, the aggregate drop in activity (both imports and exports decline) is causing havoc among its trading partners who are used to shipping vast quantities of raw materials (Brazil, Australia, Canada) or equipment (Korea, Germany, Japan) into China, which then uses the inputs to export a vast amount of consumer goods to the rest of the world.

We now expect GDP to grow by an annual 6.4 percent in the third quarter,\" ANZ said, saying further policy support would help growth rebound to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter.\nIn the United States, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group for purchasing managers, reported that its manufacturing index slid to 51.1 last month from 52.7 in July.\nIt was the second straight drop and marked the weakest reading since May 2013. Anything above 50 signals growth. Source: AGENCIES Other Investment Instruments & Ideas :: Re: Market Timing 04 (Mar 14 - Dec 15) :: Reply by ... Posted: 02 Sep 2015 03:21 PM PDT When Will It End?

Posted: 02 Sep 2015 03:35 PM PDT If you're sitting on large losses right now, here's what to do by Justin Brill\nIf you're holding large losses today, it's likely due to a few reasons\u2026\nYou may have too much money in stocks (poor asset allocation), too much money in individual positions (poor position sizing), and/or you didn't have a defined exit strategy (you didn't use \u2013 or didn't follow \u2013 trailing stops).\nIf you find yourself in this position, the first thing you must do is decide on an exit strategy immediately\u2026\nWhat you decide will depend on your circumstances. But you need to know when or why you'll sell each position you own.\nIf you have too much money in stocks or too much money in individual positions, this will likely include \"lightening up\" or selling some immediately.\nIf you didn't use trailing stops \u2013 or if you ignored the ones you set \u2013 you need to set them now. If you can't stand any more losses, that may mean selling today.\nThe key point is you must define exactly how much more you're willing to lose and stick to that strategy no matter what. Hoping your investments \"come back\" is not a viable strategy.\nTaking losses is always tough, but it's often the best thing you can do. As our colleague Jeff Clark shared in a private e-mail today\u2026\nThe simplest solution is to just take the hit and move on. This is also the most therapeutic solution. Losing money is stressful. And that stress can interfere with one's ability to think clearly. Once you take the loss, you eliminate that stress and can now evaluate the situation with a clear head.\nUnfortunately, there's no painless solution to large losses. But many new investors have made similar mistakes. The important thing is that you don't allow a big loss to turn into a catastrophic loss that wipes out your portfolio. And then make sure you learn from the experience.\nAs Doc Eifrig's senior analyst Matt Weinschenk reminded us in a note this morning, the only way to prevent these kinds of losses again is to prepare in advance\u2026\nYou have no control over the market. You cannot will your stocks back up or \"trade your way\" to even. This is the last piece of evidence you need to see that investing is about preparation, not reaction.\nAs of this morning, the market appears to be powering higher. That's in your favor. It's our opinion that the market will rally and we'll be back in the black in no time. But you can take an honest appraisal of your holdings and decide what's truly a quality investment, and what's junk. Get rid of the junk, hold the quality, and wait for them to come back. Take a look at stellar stocks you may have missed out on. If you can get a good deal on them today, those cheap stocks may help offset some losses.\nYour real move here, though, is to prepare for next time. The market will have corrections like this again. It will have much worse ones. You need to understand position sizing, asset allocation, and trailing stops, and you need to prepare yourself mentally to trust in a proper plan and ride out market turmoils like these.\nSource: Stansberry Digest Other Investment Instruments & Ideas :: Re: Fund Flows :: Reply by winston Posted: 02 Sep 2015 04:58 PM PDT Advisors Grab Cash, Bonds and Gold\nhttp://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/31 ... -and-gold/ Other Investment Instruments & Ideas :: Re: School of Hard Knocks 03 (Feb 13 - Dec 15) :: ... Posted: 02 Sep 2015 03:11 PM PDT From Tulips to Dragons By Harry S. Dent Jr.\nThere's a reason why I warn you to get out of a bubble a little early rather than a little late. It's because the first wave down tends to happen in a matter of a few weeks or months, sometimes days. It's fast and furious.\nI know this because I've studied every major bubble in modern history \u2013 all the way back to the infamous tulip bubble in 1637, when a single tulip cost more than most people made in a single year! And what I've seen in each case, without exception, is that bubbles do not correct in nice stair steps when they're coming off their highs. They burst, crash, collapse, clatter, clang \u2013 however you want to say it!\nIt's Only Going to Get Worse!\nOn August 24th, the Dow dropped a record-breaking 1,089 points in the first few hours of trading. Since then, it has bounced 919 points and today it's been down as much as 400 points. China is even worse, losing 25.1% in just five trading days. As we head deeper into crash season, this kind of volatility is par for the course. Things are only going to get worse.\nBelow I have four charts that make the argument for me. They show the 1929 bubble burst\u2026 the 1987 crash\u2026 the 2000 \"Tech Wreck\"\u2026 and the latest of 2015 from the Red Dragon itself \u2013 China's Tsunami.\nIn each case, the fact that these bubbles were destined to burst were only obvious to the few that weren't in denial. Most give into the bubble logic that new highs are the new norms. They think: \"This time is different.\" It's not! It never is. It's always hard to predict exactly when bubbles will peak and crash. It's like dropping grains of sand on the floor. A mound will build up \u2013 becoming like a Hershey's kiss that grows more narrow at the top. At some point, one grain of sand will cause the avalanche. Who knows which grain of sand that one will be!\nHere are those charts. Like I said, they speak for themselves!\nBubbles\nSee larger image\nWhat does that tell you!? EVERY bubble bursts. Bam, pow \u2013 no exceptions! So hopefully you understand why I keep harping on about this.\nI'm just as amazed as anyone that this global bubble has gone on as long as it has. But it's finally started to crash.\nYou can tell by following a series of recent tops in major markets:\nTransports in November\u2026\nUtilities in January\u2026\nGermany's DAX index and Britain's FTSE in April\u2026\nWhat looks to be the Dow and S&P 500 in May\u2026\nChina's Shanghai index in June\u2026\nAnd the Nasdaq looks to have peaked in July.\nNow that we're in the classic \"crash season,\" the situation only looks worse. This season technically started in mid-August, and won't end until mid-October. This is not to say the chaos won't continue later on into the end of this year. It just means the worst decline, this first wave down, is likely to come in the next several weeks.\nSo consider this current bounce a gift. The signs are all there that this global bubble is done. Use this time to get out of any passive investments in stocks.\nSource: Economy & Markets Other Investment Instruments & Ideas :: Re: School of Hard Knocks 03 (Feb 13 - Dec 15) :: ...

True friends are those who help in uplifting your life by cleansing your ideals and emotions. Those who drag you into pomp, pedantry, paltry entertainment and petty pranks are enemies, not friends. True friends cannot be won by social status, external scintillation or verbal assertions. A friendship knit by monetary bonds is disrupted as soon as you ask the loan to be repaid. So, when you oblige your friend with a loan, the friendship too is broken at that very moment. How can friendship be cemented by words or by coins? The feeling of friendship must activate every nerve, permeate every blood-cell, and purify every emotional wave; it has no place for the slightest trace of egotism. The companionship which seeks to exploit or fleece for personal benefit cannot be elevated into the noble quality of friendship. Perhaps, the only friend who can pass this rigorous test, is the Divine.\n- Divine Discourse, May 24, 1973.\nAmong the nine forms of devotion, the foremost is the cultivation of the sakhya (friendship) of the Divine.
