We expect that the case will be dismissed and in future, to avoid these reoccurring\u00a0meritless\u00a0lawsuits directed at Chris Brown.\" \n \nPerna said they plan to seek damages from \"all parties and their lawyers.\" \n \nIn August last year, former hip-hop mogul Suge Knight and two others\u00a0 were shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Brown. Brown later tweeted his frustration:\u00a0 \"It's disappointing that we as a society can't have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes.\" \n \nA month later,\u00a0 a fan was stabbed while\u00a0Brown was performing at a Drake and Lil Wayne after-party in Hollywood. \n \nBriley's claim comes just over a month after Brown made headlines for being stranded in the Philippines \u00a0after he was accused of skipping out on a concert he was paid to perform. \n \nNOW WATCH: New aerial footage shows aftermath of explosion in China \n\nMore From Business Insider \n\nA brunette Taylor Swift debuts her 'Wildest Dreams' music video during MTV VMAs \nHere's the brilliant way Justin Bieber used tons of celebrities to market his newest song \nCarly Rae Jepsen made a brilliant career move after \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 \u2014 and now she has the best pop album of the year", "source": "Yahoo!
