It reported an annual loss of $8.5 billion in April, one of the biggest losses in U.K. corporate history, after being stung by a sharp fall in the value of its real estate. \n\nThe disastrous result followed an accounting scandal last year when Tesco admitted overstating its profit forecasts. \n\nSouth Korea was Tesco\u2019s biggest business outside the U.K. \n\nHomeplus is South Korea\u2019s second biggest retailer with more than 900 stores. It is the only large foreign-operated supermarket chain in the country. \n\nThe deal, which still needs to be approved by regulators, should be finalized by the end of the year, Tesco said.", "source": "WBAP News/Talk 820"}
