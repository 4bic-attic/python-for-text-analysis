Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! \u00a0 These words are from a book I once read called Peace Is Every Step by Thich Nhat Hanh who is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk.\u00a0 The book is about practicing mindfulness in everyday life.\u00a0 One passage I read was about how we all think too much.\u00a0 For most of us our minds have a never ending tape loop that plays over and over. \u00a0Much of what we think about is not worth the time and a great number of our thoughts are negative.\u00a0 By focusing on our breath, we can reduce the amount of time wasted on unnecessary and potentially negative thinking.\u00a0 Realistically, we cannot stop all thinking.\u00a0 Many of life\u2019s daily tasks require some level of intellectual activity.\u00a0 However, I give you this challenge.\u00a0 Today, when you are not involved in a task that requires you to think, don\u2019t think.\u00a0 Between your tasks that require thinking, focus on your breath and enjoy the stillness that it will bring.\u00a0 If you choose to have a cup of coffee or tea during these moments, smell the aroma of the coffee or tea, pay attention to the taste of your coffee or tea, and finally, enjoy it in a very mindful way.\u00a0 For those few moments let your attention be on your breathing and the experience of your drink.\u00a0 Such intentional focus is what mindfulness is all about.", "source": "Stumbling along the Spiritual Path"}
