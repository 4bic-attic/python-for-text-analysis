She\u2019s a powerful presence, which her acceptance speech alone proved. It was a riveting moment when she took the stage and began quoting Harriet Tubman. But I do think this Shonda Rhimes show is totally hokey, with crazy histrionics and flat plot twists, and last season I found Davis\u2019s performance on it monochromatic and \u2014 perhaps due to the silly script \u2014 kind of nonsensical. Anyhoo, \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d returns Thursday night.\n\nContinue reading below \n\nThe Player 10 p.m., NBC\n\nOnce upon a time, NBC owned this timeslot with \u201cER\u201d and, before that, \u201cL.A. Law.\u201d Now, the network can\u2019t find a solid show for the slot to save its life. This feeble action effort stars Philip Winchester (left) as a former FBI operative who now is a security consultant, and Wesley Snipes (right) as the mysterious head of a mysterious organization that recruits him. Basically, the organization calculates probabilities of crime and then takes bets on whether Winchester can stop them. Or something like that. \n\nDocumentary Now! 10 and 10:30 p.m., IFC\n\nJazzin\u2019 for Blue Jean.\n\nL.A.
