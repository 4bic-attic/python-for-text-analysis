Neither deputy was wearing a body camera. \n\nHowever, cellphone video captured by a bystander appears to shows deputies approaching a shirtless Flores as he puts his hands up to surrender before he is shot multiple times and falls to the ground, motionless. One of Flores' arms is obscured by a light post. It is not possible to see if he had a weapon in the hand which is not visible in the video. \n\nIt was not clear what occurred before the recording began.", "source": "NBC New York"}
