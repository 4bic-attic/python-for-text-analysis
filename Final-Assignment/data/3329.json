On: 21 Sep 2015 @ 4:55 pm 0 Comments A fairly quiet weekend for the GT Factory Racing Team at Antur Stiniog for the close of the British Downhill Series this week. With Gee and Rachel Atherton spending time with the family this weekend after the death of their Grandpa it was left to the young guns \u2013 Taylor Vernon and Kade Edwards to rep the team at one of our favourite venues. Antur is steep and challenging. Situated in an old slate quarry it\u2019s a dramatic venue for spectators who have a good view of riders all the way don the track but weather conditions can make it extremely difficult to ride. Saturday\u2019s practise was sunny, dusty and still. Kade said \u201c I was having so much fun, just shredding with my mates and having a laugh, it was mint!\u201d But come Sunday and the infamous Snowdonia weather rolled in bring wind up top with rain and mist below. Despite heavy rain for his run in Youth Men\u2019s seeding runs Kade had a solid run and enjoyed the experience, seeding 2nd to Matt Walker. Taylor crashed in his seeding run finishing in 23rd. Come race runs and the Youth Men rain was pretty heavy, Kade decided to take it steady and play it safe. He said \u201c I wanted to play it safe but I ended up riding like a grandma! Still I ended up 5th with a decent time and I had a great weekend riding so I\u2019m Ok with that.\u201d By the Elite Mens race the wind had rally strengthened up top. Taylor said \u201c The rain had made the track as slick as ice, it was hard to push on and the wind was actually blowing me backwards. Not happy at all with my result this weekend, wish I could have ended 2015 on a stronger note but I\u2019ll be working hard towards 2016.\u201d \u00a0 In the Junior Women\u2019s category sponsored by Rachel Atherton, Rosy Monaghan took the win with Gemma Taylor in second and Rona Strivens in third.
