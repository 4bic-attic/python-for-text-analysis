Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentagelo said that when another person tried to intervene between the two, Ballentine pulled out an eyebrow razor and slashed the good samaritan on the elbow. \n \nCannady then pulled out a small can of pepper spray and hit Ballentine in the face with the spray. Several people on board reported breathing difficulties after the spray was used. \n \nThe captain opened the cabin door and ordered Ballentine escorted off the plane. \n \nIn a statement, JetBlue said that \"On August 26, a customer disagreement occurred shortly after flight 960 arrived at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport from Kingston, Jamaica. Law enforcement were called and met the aircraft.\" \n \nBoth women were placed under arrest on a variety of charges. What is not known is how the two women were allowed to board the plane with the razor and the pepper spray. Security screenings in Kingston, where the flight originated, are the purview of the Jamaican Civil Aviation Authority. \n \n(Image from file.
