As the Huffington Post reports, Synnes demonstrated that when you gather a bunch of rubber duck toys , squeeze the air out of them, and unleash the flock, you can create a powerfully unsettling cacophony. The Duck Army video was later made into a Vine by Charlie Murphy of Ireland, which went viral in a powerful way, having racked up over 644,000 likes since it was first shared. \n  \nEnter MythBuster Adam Savage, who decided to engage in a little freelance myth-busting outside of the confines of his show. In a blog post published at Tested on Sunday, Savage acknowledged that he had his own reservations regarding the reality of the Duck Army video. \n \nI felt a great disturbance in #TheForce , as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. https://t.co/IBUkDRS16G \n \n\u2014 Adam Savage (@donttrythis) September 9, 2015  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s possible by now you\u2019ve seen my rubber-duck screaming video, but I want to give credit where credit is due. Like many, I had my doubts as to the Duck Army video\u2019s veracity: I couldn\u2019t imagine that all the duck noisemakers could be set to such varying tones, making it sound like a visit to Dante\u2019s Hell. Or something out of a Bruegel painting.\u201d \n  \nAnd now I present to you\u2026 the DUCK BOMB. #duckarmy  https://t.co/4oOMXgvfVN \n \n\u2014 Adam Savage (@donttrythis) September 14, 2015 \n \nBuilt a little something for my #duckarmy . Ready for the video? pic.twitter.com/7j2gRDt6ng \n \n\u2014 Adam Savage (@donttrythis) September 14, 2015  \n \nSavage proceeded to order 12 duck dog toys and construct his Duck Bomb, which consists of a plywood box that holds 10 of the toys compacted together. Removing the safety sets off Savage\u2019s Duck Bomb, allowing the toys to inflate and begin wailing with a collective moan reminiscent of the damned, which confirms the validity of the original Duck Army video. According to the MythBusters host, the actual sound of the screaming duck toys is \u201ceven more amazing in person than you can imagine.\u201d \n \nThough Savage refers to his Duck Bomb as \u201cthe ultimate secret weapon,\u201d he managed to share the video with his 1.25 million Twitter followers on Monday. According to Laughing Squid , the rubber ducks responsible for the viral phenomenon are actually Kyjen Squawkie Talkie rubber pelicans. While Synnes admits that the original video was meant to simply embarrass his girlfriend, the Duck Army has taken on a life of its own, now going one step further with Adam Savage\u2019s Duck Bomb. \n \n[Photo via Twitter/ Adam Savage via Laughing Squid ] \n \nMythBuster Adam Savage Reveals Screaming \u2018Duck Bomb,\u2019 His Take On The \u2018Duck Army\u2019 is an article from: The Inquisitr News", "source": "The Inquisitr News"}
