Here are four of the main reasons why\u00a0reading to children \u2014 especially when you do it regularly\u00a0\u2014 could be\u00a0crucial: \n 1. It\u00a0stimulates parts of the brain associated with visual processing.\u00a0  \nA recent\u00a0 study \u00a0highlighted by the\u00a0 New York Times \u00a0found increased\u00a0activity in the areas of children's\u00a0brain associated with processing images, suggesting that even when kids aren't reading themselves, they are picturing the places they're hearing about. \n \n\u201cWhen kids are hearing stories, they\u2019re imagining in their mind\u2019s eye,\u201d\u00a0 John S. Hutton, a\u00a0clinical research fellow at\u00a0 the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and the lead author of the\u00a0paper, told the Times . \n 2. It's\u00a0different than just talking to them.   \nAnother\u00a0 study \u00a0suggests that\u00a0reading aloud to children\u00a0starting when they're infants exposes them to more words than they might pick up from conversation alone. The study also suggested that reading aloud provides them with a better picture of a variety of\u00a0sentence structures and vocabulary. \n  3. It may boost their ability to\u00a0process information. \u00a0  \nA recent study \u00a0based on data from 4-and-5-year-old Australian children found that \u2014 even when they controlled for factors like their parents\u2019 income and education levels \u2014 kids whose parents said they read to them at least 6 days a week scored higher on national tests designed to measure understanding and comprehension than those whose parents said they read to them just once or twice a week or less. The differing results appeared to hold steady roughly until the kids reached age 10. \n 4. It may help them problem solve.\u00a0  \nIn a survey \u00a0of 9-month-olds in Ireland, researchers found that children whose mothers said they read and talked to them \"often\" or \"always\" up until that age performed better\u00a0on a private questionnaire used by the University of California San Francisco\u00a0and the University of Oregon \u00a0 than those whose moms said they read to them \"rarely,\" \"never,\" or \"not at all,\" even when controlling for mother's income and education levels. \n \nNOW WATCH: New aerial footage shows aftermath of explosion in China \n\nMore From Business Insider \n\nA geneticist says any new parent should 'roll their child on floor of the New York subway' \u2014 here's why \nParents are more worried about their teens having time for homework than being bullied on social media, study says \nTongue-rolling myth busted!
