With the Dodgers employing a five-man infield, De Aza hit a fly to left against Adam Liberatore for a victory that prevented San Francisco from being eliminated from the pennant race.\n\nYimi Garcia (3-5) took the loss.\n\nLos Angeles lost its fourth straight game after a weekend sweep at Colorado and is five games ahead of the Giants with six to play.\n\nGreinke, who had his last turn skipped as he nursed a tender right calf, had his five-start winning streak snapped dating to an Aug. 22 defeat at Houston.", "source": "Register-Guard"}
