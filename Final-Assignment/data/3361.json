I\u2019ve been on the housing waiting list and Section 8 waiting list since I was divorced in 1993. I\u2019ve always kept both places notified of my addresses as they\u2019ve changed. I\u2019ve been filling out applications for places to live for some time now. My questions are: 1) How can you get a housing certificate or Section 8 voucher when you don\u2019t have custody of your child/children? 2) How is it that my name keeps on falling through the cracks for a housing certificate and/or Section 8 voucher? 3) Why can\u2019't my son and I get any housing help? I have been denied Social Security disability for two years now and finally decided to go directly for a hearing, which I got for this October. I suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, neuropathy of my feet and hands, arthritis, ongoing back problems and fibromyalgia. I\u2019m not looking for something for free. I\u2019m just looking for some help. I\u2019ve lived on Cape Cod all my life and never have I struggled to have a place to live and call it my home.
