I\u2019m sure there\u2019s hints of influences all up and down the series ( Beastmaster , for one), but what indelibly sets it apart from everything else on television is one thing: Its showrunner. The Bastard Executioner is Sutter as f*ck. Everything viewers have grown\u00a0used to after seven seasons of Sons of Anarchy is there, and that includes all the excesses. Sutter doesn\u2019t know the word restraint. Why use five buckets of blood when you can use 100? Why have one scene featuring a backdoor-bang in the pilot when you can have three! Sutter is the kind of guy who doesn\u2019t stop at gutting a man with a sword, not when he can also stab him in the throat, in the back of the head, and through the taint (no, really!). What\u2019s better than a battle scene? A battle scene with a naked woman walking through it, of course! It\u2019s gloriously Sutter, and that also includes his inability to edit himself. Sutter is not an efficient storyteller, but he is an effective one. \n \nWhatever your feelings on Sutter, that voice and style is distinctive. He is blunt. And profane. He is bloody, and he is cruel . Sutter is not for everyone. He is Shakespeare and Mot\u00f6rhead by way of Jersey, a bottle of whiskey, and a couple of snuff films. In a room with his contemporaries \u2014 Matthew Weiner, Vince Gilligan, David Simon, David Chase, etc. \u2014 he may not be anyone\u2019s\u00a0first choice to write a complex long-running series, but he would be a great\u00a0first choice in a knife fight. While Weiner is huddled in a corner praying for the attackers to leave, and while Vince Gilligan was trying to nice-guy talk them out of attacking with a reasoned plea, Kurt Sutter would be the guy out in front kicking the attackers\u2019 asses. After he\u2019d left them bloody and unconscious, he\u2019d go back and stab them in the eye for good measure. \n \nHe\u2019s not a subtle man. All of his characters are bad people, it\u2019s just that the villains do bad things for the selfish reasons, while his protagonists do bad things out of loyalty, for family, and most of all, out of vengeance. Sutter loves a good revenge tale, and he has never met a war of attrition he couldn\u2019t drag out for seven seasons. It may get exhausting in seasons two, four and six, but the high points will ultimately be worth the low ones. \n \n\nThat\u2019s Kurt Sutter, and everything you love and maybe hate about him is on full display in The Bastard Executioner \u2018s unnecessarily long two-hour pilot. There\u2019s gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence and gratuitous profanity, so if you\u2019re a fan of gratuity, you\u2019re going to love this series. \n \nThere are a lot of characters in the pilot of The Bastard Executioner , but you don\u2019t really need to worry yourself keeping up with who is who. By the end of the episode, most of them are dead anyway. There are really only six or seven characters you have to concern yourself with going forward. \n \nHere\u2019s who you need to know. \n \nFX \n\n \nWilkin Brattle (Lee Jones) is a Welsh warrior in the\u00a014th century. He\u2019s like Charlie Hunnam plus a beastly John Krasinski. Brattle has seen enough of the ravages of the war to lay down his sword and return to his small village and live out a peaceful life with his wife, who is pregnant. How do you know his wife is going to die in the pilot? Because she is pregnant, and this is a Kurt Sutter series, people. Keep up! Of course she\u2019s going to die in the pilot, and of course they\u2019ll rip out her guts and leave them lying across her body. \n \n\n \nFX \n\n \nConflict arises when the cruel and greedy English baron Erik Ventris ( Brian F. O\u2019Byrne ) starts taxing their village too harshly. In order to send a message to the baron, Brattle and his merry men of masked bandits take out a few of the king\u2019s men. The baron finds out the identities of the bandits, and in order to send his own message, he burns down and kills everyone in Wilkin\u2019s village, leaving behind a stack of dead bodies. \n \nFX \n\n \nBrattle\u2019s wife manages to escape briefly, but is killed while fleeing. However, she\u2019s not killed by any of the baron\u2019s men. She\u2019s murdered by a healer, Annora of the Alders (Katey Sagal, sporting long grey hair and a Welsh- ish accent). Brattle doesn\u2019t know this, however. He thinks the baron is fully responsible, so he gathers a group of rebels (including a nearly unrecognizable Matthew Rhys, from The Americans ) and he gets his revenge, killing the baron and all his men. It is bloody. Gloriously, violently bloody. \n \n\n \nFX \n\n \nThe baron, however, stabs Brattle before he gets a knife through the back of his own head and through his mouth. Annora \u2014 the healer \u2014 brings Brattle back to life, but in doing so, she carves a cross on his cheek, allowing\u00a0Brattle to\u00a0pass for another man, an executioner. Under the guise of that dead man\u2019s identity, Wilkin returns to the baron\u2019s castle and offers up his services. \n \nThere are\u00a0a few catches, of course. The man who died \u2014 the series\u2019 Dick Whitman \u2014 had a wife and kids, but they\u2019re happy to accept Brattle as their new husband and father because Brattle doesn\u2019t beat them, as the dead man did. \n \nFX \n\n \nHowever, the baroness Lady Love Ventris (Flora Spencer-Longhurst), who takes over after the death of her cruel husband, is actually a lovely person, and seems like she\u2019ll be a good ruler. She also takes a fancy to Brattle, which is an interesting wrinkle. How is the executioner supposed to feel about the wife of the man whom he thinks killed his own wife? \n \n\n \nFX \n\n \nThere\u2019s also the chamberlain Milus Corbett (Stephen Moyer), who was the baron\u2019s right-hand man and now the baroness\u2019 advisor. He\u2019s sketchy as hell, and\u00a0Moyer is terrific in the role. He\u2019s instrumental in bringing on the executioner, and then assigning him the task of killing the chamberlain\u2019s brother, one of the only other people who knew the truth about Brattle\u2019s identity. The chamberlain clearly has political aspirations, and he has his doubts about the executioner, but we\u2019re not entirely sure of his motivations beyond that. \n \nFX \n\n \nOther characters include\u00a0Father Ruskin ( Sons alum Timothy V. Murphy), who seems like he may play the series\u2019 Varys; Toran Prichard (Sam Spruell), the executioner\u2019s best friend and confidante,\u00a0and Petra (Elen Rhys), who plays the executioner\u2019s late\u00a0wife. (She\u2019ll\u00a0will recur in visions.) Meanwhile, we don\u2019t really know what the deal with Sagal\u2019s character, Annora, is yet, but we do know she\u2019s in cahoots with The Dark Mute (Kurt Sutter himself), a hideous creature who lives in a cave. It\u2019s very, very Sutter. \n \n\n \nFX \n\n \nAnd yes, Sarah White \u2014 who plays the baroness\u2019 assistant \u2014 is Katey Sagal\u2019s daughter, as if you couldn\u2019t divine that from their likeness. \n \nFX \n\n \nThere\u2019s plenty about The Bastard Executioner that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a show that practically lends itself to being ripped apart. But it\u2019s easier, and far more enjoyable, simply to let the Sutter wash over you \u2014 if you can stomach the bloody violence and the brutal sex scenes.", "source": "UPROXX \u00bb Web Culture"}
