His local doctors placed him on medication that offered him little hope for improvement. After his daughter exhaustively searched alternatives, she came across the Gates Vascular Institute (GVI) in Buffalo, New York, and its leadership in conducting successful submaximal angioplasty, a vascular procedure that provides an alternative to stenting and medical therapy. \n \nMr. Cooper traveled to Buffalo and underwent a successful procedure that saw him return to Australia with his blockage cleared. In the planning and execution of the angioplasty, GVI used Toshiba\u2019s Aquilion TM ONE CT\u2019s perfusion capabilities to confirm a severe narrowing of Mr. Cooper\u2019s intracranial basilar artery. The team then utilized the Infinix\u2122 Elite cardiovascular X-ray system\u2019s superior visualization to carry out the angioplasty to expand the artery and immediately improve blood flow. The decision to use this over the commonly used medical therapy saved his life and prevented a potentially devastating stroke. \n \n\u201cWhile many physicians don\u2019t consider interventional solutions for this condition, our facility has a strong track record of effectively using submaximal angioplasty to treat intracranial stenosis,\u201d said Adnan Siddiqui, M.D., Ph.D., director of neurosurgical stroke service, Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute, and professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the University of Buffalo. \u201cThe Toshiba systems allowed us to properly assess the situation and effectively use this technique in a manner that allowed the patient to be discharged the next day and be on his way home to Sydney in ten days\u2019 time.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe safety and experience of patients treated with our systems is the major influence in our system designs,\u201d said Satrajit Misra, vice president, Marketing, Toshiba. \u201cThe use of multiple Toshiba systems across the CT and X-ray/vascular modalities for this procedure highlights that as these therapies evolve, physicians trust our systems to give them the tools they need for success.\u201d \n \nAbout Toshiba  America Medical Systems, Inc. \n \nWith headquarters in Tustin, Calif., Toshiba America Medical Systems markets, sells, distributes and services radiology and cardiovascular systems, including CT, MR, ultrasound, X-ray and cardiovascular equipment, and coordinates clinical diagnostic imaging research for all modalities in the United States.
