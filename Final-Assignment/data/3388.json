From the results found, the researchers determined that free sugars are the primary factor in the creation of cavities.

The guidelines recommend that everyone reduce their sugar consumption to below 10% of their total energy intake, as well as brush twice a day, floss, and use an antiseptic mouthwash. It is also important to visit a dentist at least twice a year.

Practicing good oral hygiene and scheduling an appointment for a cleaning and X-rays every six months will detect any issues before they become a cause for concern,\u201d Dr. Mummery concludes. \u201cIf caught early, many oral health concerns can be treated easily.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Princeview Dental or to book an appointment for dental services at its Etobicoke office, visit www.PrinceviewDental.com.
