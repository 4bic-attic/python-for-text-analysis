Reading some of the bile that people write can be truly depressing. \n \nThen we have our own Sunshine Coast councillors squabbling about overtime fees passed on to funeral directors by the council should families grieve too long by their loved ones' graveside. \n \n\"It's user pays. The funeral director doesn't have to pass it on,\" half of the councillors tried to defensively spout. \n \nI have to ask myself, at what point in life do you stop hearing what you are actually saying? \n \nDo they know what they sound like? \n \nThankfully, my faith was restored, first when a majority of councillors voted to waive two funeral overtime fees, and, more importantly, when a local man phoned the paper during the week after reading the story of a local Lyme disease sufferer in need of a new wheelchair. \n \n\"I'll pay for it, but I don't want anyone to know it was me,\" the man said. \n \nThat was it. No agenda, no big-noting himself, just a thoroughly decent man doing decent things. \n \nIf only more people would think about what they give out.", "source": "Sunshine Coast Daily"}
