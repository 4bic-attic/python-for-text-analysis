I\u2019m sure you remember that the field usually served as overflow parking for the show. Your story brought back many memories of attending shows there. The first show I ever went to was in 1977 as a seven-year-old. My first purchase was a 1977 Jim Kaat to complete my Phillies team set. I bought it off of a husband and wife (I think his name was Frank). Their table was right there as soon as you made the right after paying. They were always in that same spot. I remember not really understanding why they had a pile of Jim Kaats and I could never get one from packs.\u00a0 Red Merchant, Boston Braves fan and from San\u00a0\u00a0Antonio reminded us of his favorite early 1950s Braves and the Lew Burdette error card, which shows him not only pitching with the wrong hand but spells his name \u201cLou\u201d instead of \u201cLew\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0I wrote about it last year. So, as I\u2019m going through memories of my past life, I open up this trunk that has been sitting for ages.\u00a0 Inside, my baseball card collection of basically Boston/Milwaukee Braves from before I enter the Air Force in \u201862.\u00a0 Warren Spahn, Bob Buhl, Johnny Antonelli, George Crowe \u2013 they\u2019re\u00a0 all in there.\u00a0 Then you look at the (1959 Topps) Burdette card, and then you go looking on the internet, and it leads me to you!\u00a0 A question:\u00a0 Do we know just how many of these were printed?\u00a0 Was the entire collection run, with no one noticing that the spelling, as well as the picture were wrong?\u00a0 Thanks for your time.\u00a0 Red, unless we find the Topps archives and the paperwork is complete we\u2019ll never how many of each card was produced but we can say the \u201cLefty\u201d Burdette card was never corrected but is still popular with collectors and a great conversation piece. Burdette was sent to the Braves late in the 1951 season by the Yankees for Johnny Sain. While Sain was not a front line starter for the Yankees he did help them the next three World Series while Burdette went on to win over 200 games in the rest of his career, most of them for the Braves. Collector George O\u2019Neal wrote us about this year\u2019s Topps Chrome and something a lot of collectors are experiencing, which I noted in my box break/review last week: I\u2019m having a heck of\u00a0a time telling which card is a refractor.\u00a0 Is there a trick?\u00a0 I\u2019ve been collecting Chrome for about five years now, and it wasn\u2019t really ever this hard to tell (and it helped with the \u2018refractor\u2019 tag on the back of an actual card too).\u00a0 George, the way I found out was I had two Paul Konerko cards and was able to hold them to the light to determine the refractor. We mentioned in our review how we wished Topps would have labeled the refractors. We noticed in the Bowman Chrome preview information \u00a0thatall refractor cards appear to be serial numbered. To me, even if there is no refractor labeling, cards with serial numbers are sufficient to contrast those to base cards. Rick Friedman wrote us in response to my column\u00a0about the 20th anniversary of Cal Ripken breaking Lou Gehrig\u2019s record and his commitment to sign autographs for fans after each game. I have been reading your articles for some time, and thank you for doing them. They bring a little joy to my stressful business day, while I take a 10 minute \u201d vacation\u201d and look at the various links. \u00a0Many of the links have been costly\u2026.turning me on to new auction site, only to find an item I just cannot live without.\u00a0 Anyway, your recent article about Cal Ripken signing\u00a0 autographs reminds me of Pete Rose.\u00a0 When I was 14-16 years old I was a \u201clobby rat\u201d and \u201cstadium rat\u201d, getting all the players\u2019 autographs from that era (late 1960s and early 1970s) but one who impressed me was Rose, who would stand in the street and sign autographs for anyone there and talk to them with respect.\u00a0 I would be amazed that as the Reds team would check into a hotel at\u00a0midnight, all the players ran into their rooms but the star of the team, who would stand in the street or lobby, and sign autographs for what seemed forever ( maybe 15 -30 minutes).\u00a0 He loved being Pete Rose. I got hooked on collecting HOF memorabilia after a few trips to Cooperstown and created in the last six years my own mini Hall of Fame and now have about 600 museum artifacts. \u00a0Bats, gloves, signed ball, uniforms, caps, photos and now have a very serious collection.\u00a0 I thought I had a great collection until I\u00a0 visited Gary Cypres\u2019 LA Sports Museum last year which put me in my place. \u00a0He owns EVERTHING\u00a0 from the Yankees and Dodgers \u00a0in a building about two blocks long. It\u2019s interesting to hear collectors\u2019 experiences with various players, especially those memories from before autographs were a commodity. \u00a0Despite his issues over the years, Pete still has an enormous fan base and probably won a lot of them over during those signing sessions so many years ago.\u00a0 And yes, Gary Cypres\u2019 collection is a national treasure. \u00a0 We also received a great email from an old dealer comrade of mine, Glenn Peddicord, from New Jersey who enjoyed a column I wrote awhile back about the 1967 Topps Brooks Robinson. \u00a0 I now live in Indiana, but I still plan to move back to my hometown of Baltimore in the next couple of years.\u00a0 I am still in the hobby, but only as a collector. I have been putting together 1950s & 1960s Topps and Bowman sets, which is something I should have done back in the 1980s.\u00a0 Oh well. It was great to hear from Glenn. When I was working in Mike Gordon\u2019s shop back in the late 1980s, the store ordered 350 cases of 1989 Fleer factory sets since that was the only item they offered directly to the hobby. When the truck delivered them, it was Glenn who helped carry all of \u00a0those sets from the truck into the store\u2013 and some into the basement. Now, in those days, one could have just made a couple of dollars on each\u00a0set by offering\u00a0them to the other dealers in the area but not every dealer was comfortable wholesaling to others \u00a0As it developed, Ken Griffey Jr. really took off the next year and Mike did fine selling the sets himself. But it always is a good discussion which persists to this day. Some dealers are fine working with their fellow dealers while others are retail to the public only. Even today, those decisions are\u00a0up to the individual dealer.", "source": "Sports Collectors Daily"}
