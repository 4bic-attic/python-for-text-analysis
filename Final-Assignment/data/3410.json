A Syrian refugee has opened up about the fear that forced him to leave his home country. Muhammad Hussain, who now lives in Griffith with fellow refugee Zahid Hussain, recounted the many horrors he saw in his home country.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) very dangerous (in Syria), every morning, every afternoon, every night, killing,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cYou sleep and when you wake up you look at the road at all the killing.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Syria, Muhammad\u2019s house was torched by insurgents.\n\nMuhammad said there were mass murders in towns where in excess of 300 people were put into a single grave.\n\nHe has not heard from his father in four years but holds onto hope that he is alive.\n\n\u201cThe first time I go to Pakistan because my father tell me \u2018you go because I\u2019m scared (for your safety). You go to Pakistan, look around Pakistan and see if you can live (there)\u2019 but after this I come (to Australia),\u201d Muhammad said.\n\n\u201cI was born in Syria, my father lived there for 35, 40 years. For four years, I don't know where he is.\u201d\n\nMuhammad fled Syria to Pakistan in 2012 before he came to Australia in October the same year.\n\nHis wife, daughter, brother and sisters still reside in Pakistan. Muhammad\u2019s daughter was just seven months old when he left his family.\n\nHe is able to contact his family on the phone but hasn't seen anyone since he has been in Australia.\n\nHe hopes one day he will be able to visit neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Syria to visit his family.\n\nOne of his biggest fears is his daughter rejecting him as her father after living apart for so long.\n\n\u201cI only stay home, go outside, go back, it\u2019s no life,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cMentally, every night it\u2019s tough. When I stay here, I think about my family.\n\n\u201cMy daughter when I left (Syria) was seven months old, now she\u2019s four. When I talk with her she does not talk with me. We talk very little, hi, how are you, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAlong with his family, Muhammad left behind a house and a business. He said he is stuck in limbo \u2013 not being able to work or study \u2013 and struggles to support his family.\n\nHe wants to see the government provide more support for refugees.\n\nThe Area News, Griffith", "source": "Moree Champion"}
