He was put on blood thinners to combat the matter, and he says he is off of them now and cleared for full contact. \n \n\u201cI am released and ready for contact,\u201d Bosh said Thursday via the South Florida Sun Sentinel . \n \nBosh is no longer taking blood thinners because that would make him more susceptible to bruising and bleeding. He also says he thankfully does not have a hereditary gene that is tied to blood clots, so his risk of future issues seems diminished. However, his awareness over the matter is still heightened. \n \nBosh has been doing drills for two months but is just now introducing contact. He says he has bulked up to between 240-245 pounds, and he is prepared to lead the Heat in what will be the second of his big five-year contract as the team\u2019s franchise player.", "source": "Larry Brown Sports"}
