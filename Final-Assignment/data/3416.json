A horse-drawn hearse was followed through the streets by a traditional jazz band and 40 \u201c1980s estate agents\u201d dressed in pin-stripe suits. \n\nThough new to the growing online agency sector, easyProperty is confident that its presence in the market will contribute to the demise of what it calls \u201cage-old dodgy estate agents who charge ludicrous commissions\u201d in ten years. The company, which started out as a lettings agency, has recently expanded into residential sales, offering a cut-price alternative to traditional agencies, with three alternative fixed flat-fee sales services.", "source": "What House?"}
