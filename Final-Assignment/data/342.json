Once again, weather played a factor, shortening the game, but it didn\u2019t affect the outcome as Jacobs won handily, 4-1. \n \nTrevor Jahns accounted for Kaneland\u2019s lone goal in a game that was called in the 62nd minute due to weather. \n \n\u201cIt was not one of our better games,\u201d Parillo said. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t play well in the second half, so I was a little nervous to how we were going to respond on Friday. We played a brutal second half (against Jacobs).\u201d \n \nThe Knights started the week with a hard-earned 1-1 tie against Class 3A Dundee-Crown. \nJahns gave the Knights an early lead with 13:48 left in the first half, but Dundee-Crown responded with a goal from Jelani Washington just a little more than three minutes later to knot things at 1-1. \n \nNeither team could break the tie. \n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have as many chances as they did, although we had some nice chances at the end,\u201d Parillo said. \u201cWe\u2019re not playing any powder puff teams though, and this was a good team. I keep telling our guys that it\u2019s going to be a long season if we don\u2019t realize that.\u201d \n \nThe schedule doesn\u2019t get any easier for the Knights this week. They were scheduled to travel to DeKalb on Tuesday, and they\u2019ll be at Sycamore this afternoon. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve played well against West Aurora, Dundee-Crown and now Hinckley,\u201d Parillo said. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been higher against Hinckley, but we didn\u2019t convert. We don\u2019t have any gimme games, so these have all been a good test for us, good for our resolve and mental toughness.\u201d \n \nThe Knights also haven\u2019t been at full strength for much of the season. Angel Escontrias left Tuesday\u2019s game against Dundee-Crown with an injury and hasn\u2019t played since, although he\u2019s expected back soon. Drew Franklin also has missed some games due to his dual duty as the football team\u2019s placekicker. He booted a pair of PATs last Friday, but also missed a field goal. \n \n\u201cLike I\u2019ve told the kids many times, we\u2019ve got to keep improving,\u201d Parillo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not how you start but how you finish. We haven\u2019t hit our stride yet, and have an ugly record once again at the beginning, but we had that last year too and won a regional.\u201d", "source": "Elburn Herald"}
