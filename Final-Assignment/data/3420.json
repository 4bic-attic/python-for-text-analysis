If you frequently watch different types of video you will generally have to have numerous different programs installed, each catering for different types of video \u2013 this can be an annoyance when you encounter a video for which you do not already have the required program or codec. Rather than waiting until the last minute, install the K-Lite Mega Codec Pack which includes a wide range of popular codecs for a number of different video formats. \n \nAs well as well known formats such as XviD, MPEG2 and DivX, the pack also includes audio codecs and a selection of alternative media players. Used in conjunction with each other, it is unlikely that you will encounter a video you are unable to play, and by using the alternative tools \u2013 such as Real Alternative \u2013 you can benefit from improved performance. \n \nThe codecs included in the pack can also be used when encoding your own videos and there are a number of handy tools which may well come in useful \u2013 such as a bitrate calculator, subtitling tool, video splitters and much more. The pack includes such a large number of tools and codecs, there is simply not space to cover them all in any details. Thankfully, it is not necessary to install all of the codecs at once if you do not need to \u2013 you can pick and choose the ones you need, adding others at a later date if necessary. There are a limited number of software installations that can be described as being essential, but this is one of them. \n \nNote that this\u00a0is an update pack for K-Lite Codec Pack that upgrades version 11.4\u00a0of the codec pack to version 11.4.4. \n   \nThe post appeared first on TechCentral.ie .", "source": "TechCentral.ie"}
