However, despite it being all \u201990s Nick cartoons, it is said to have a blend of animation and live-action. Nickelodeon\u2019s crossover film event is said to be similar to another live-action/cartoon blend from the \u201990s, Space Jam. \n  \nThat was then. This is now.

Parent will also produce the \u201990s Nick inspired film, if it should come to fruition. \n \nWho\u2019s pumped for Nickelodeon\u2019s new network The Splat? \n \n[Image via Facebook/The Splat ] \n \nThe Splat: Nickelodeon Launches New TV Network Dedicated To 90s Cartoons And Series is an article from: The Inquisitr News", "source": "The Inquisitr News"}
