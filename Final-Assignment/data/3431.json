Source: Supplied  \n        \n GEOFF Balderas choked back tears when he reflected on the life of the late, great Mark Trickey.  \n   \n\u201cHe was an absolute champion,\u201d Balderas said of the Lorne sporting identity who died of cancer this week. \n\n\u201cHe was a great man. He\u2019d go out of his way to help anyone. You couldn\u2019t say a bad thing about him. We used to knock around together at the club, on footy trips and so on. \n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t fault him in any way. He was the best speaker I\u2019ve ever heard. He didn\u2019t need any notes \u2014 it was straight off the cuff and just inspirational\u00ad. \n\n\u201cI was going to ask him to speak at my funeral.\u201d \n\nTrickey died on Monday \u201cafter a long and courageous struggle\u201d. He was 58. \n\nHe is survived by wife Julianne\u00ad, sons Simon, Shane and Boe and grandchildren Jax and Indiana. \n \nThe Lorne community is in mourning for the much-loved family man, who devoted his life to many of the town\u2019s sporting clubs and community groups. \n\nTrickey was the president of the Lorne Country Club and has been lauded for his role in helping the golf entity escape difficult times. \n\nHe was a life member and premiership coach of Lorne Football Club, where he played more than 180 games. \n\nTrickey was named at full back in the Dolphins\u2019 Team of the CDFL Era from 1971 to 2006 and he was the 1978 senior best and fairest. He played in Lorne\u2019s 1980 premiership before moving to coach Birregurra in 1981 and 1982. \n\nThe champion defender returned to Stribling Reserve to coach the Dolphins to the 1983 flag. He also coached Lorne in 1985. \n\n\u201cHe was a good, strong player,\u201d Balderas said. \u201cBeing a backman, he knew when to spoil. He wasn\u2019t overly fast but he was a good, solid player.\u201d \n\nTrickey was a standout cricketer for Lorne, winning the 1979-80 and 1984-85 bowling averages and belted a century in a distinguished career. \n\nHe was also an impressive golfer, winning a club championship, and played on single figures for most of his life. His handicap was as low as four. \n\nIn recent years Trickey was football operations manager. \n\n\u201cHe took care of all of the players,\u201d Lorne president Ken Hosking said. \u201cHe was a highly esteemed member of the football club; he was respected, his views were respected. \n\n\u201cI was speaking to (former senior coach) Jason Langdon and he was a mentor to him and he was a mentor to me when I started as president. \n\n\u201cHe was always around the club but his focus in recent years was at the golf club, where he was president. He had a lot of work to do there and he managed to get the club back on track. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been involved in successful operations in community work around town.\u201d \n\nTrickey was also on the Lorne Foreshore committee and a member of the Lions Village committee. \n\n\u201cHe was just a tower of strength in whatever he was involved in,\u201d Hosking said. \u201cHe put his heart and soul into everything. I was part of the Lorne Lions committee and that was another group he devoted a lot of time to. He did a lot of community stuff behind the scenes. He was a likable guy and he lived and loved life. He was taken too soon.\u201d \n\nThe funeral service will be held at 2.30pm on Friday at the Lorne Country Club.", "source": "Geelong Advertiser"}
