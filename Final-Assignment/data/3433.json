The other issue was opposition to a pending bill designed to safeguard the religious preferences of small-business owners who object to gay weddings. \n \nThe tax took effect in July, and industry leaders say it\u2019s too soon to tell what impact it\u2019s having. However, they have heard squawking about it from groups interested in booking multiple rooms for events. \n \n\u201cIt is certainly a discussion point for meeting planners,\u201d said Jim Sprouse, executive director of the Georgia Hotel & Lodging Association. \u201cThey say, \u2018I can book my meeting in another state and save all of that money.\u2019 It\u2019s particularly important for border areas.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s also a consideration for leisure travelers, truckers and highway drivers who are stopping for the night, said Michael Owens, president of the Savannah-based Tourism Leadership Council. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re so close to the border that we\u2019re hearing from many of our members that visitors are opting to just keep driving down south to Florida or north to South Carolina,\u201d he said. \n \nThe industry is backing legislation proposed by House Economic Development and Tourism Chairman Ron Stephens, R-Savannah. It would reduce the tax but try to collect the same revenue by extending it to vacation rentals and short-term rooms booked through online sites. \n \n\u201cQuite honestly, it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle because a lot of us legislators have vacation rentals,\u201d Stephens said. \n \nAnother consideration is that the vacation rental market may not be big enough to make up for half of the estimated $200 million the new nightly tax is expected to bring the state for road improvements. \n \nOwens said the 800 vacation rentals in Savannah are dwarfed by the 15,000 hotel rooms. \n \nBut Sprouse said the online rooms account for as much as 10 percent of the available rooms in Atlanta. \n \nLegislators have generally remained noncommittal, saying they don\u2019t want to do anything until they have seen at least one year\u2019s worth of tax collections. \n \nHowever, the reaction was mixed to the industry\u2019s opposition to the so-called religious-freedom bill. During a question-and-answer session at the conference, some lawmakers flatly stated their support for it. \n \nThe lodging executives are worried that passage will lead to boycotts from companies, trade shows and conventions. \n \n\u201cIf it\u2019s even discussed, we will hear about it from some groups,\u201d Sprouse said.", "source": "Augusta Chronicle"}
