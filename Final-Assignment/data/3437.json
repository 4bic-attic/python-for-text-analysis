Who Do We Appreciate\u00a0 ? ! Ha ! - Sure sounds like some Teeny-Bopper Cheerdance Pep Shout-Out from some local West Coast High - Whatever !! \u00a0Just some random ramblings to break the ice here as I share these\u00a0 \"smart snaps\" i crafted, of [only] eight members\u00a0 \u00a0 of the UP Pep Squad Alumni - who, at the Halftime Break of the UP-NU match [MoA Arena] -- again showed the UAAP faithful why the UP Pep Squad, as I Personally Feel  has always been - and will continue to be ---\u00a0\u00a0 A. A. C. A. !! --- > Always A Class Act !! But this post does not deal with such merit or status - but rather - simply - and hopefully -\u00a0 ..... shares a more \"UP-Close\" and Personal Angle  - If Only for the few the fleeting moments one will view these images\u00a0 .... .....\u00a0 and some \"silly\" thoughts on Art, in general .... So far, I am NOT that familiar [let alone, acquianted] with these 8 UP Pep Squad Alumni.\nAm \"aware\" of the names of 7 of them, in the JPEG directly below\u00a0 --\u00a0\u00a0 [forgive me] But I still am at a loss, as to who Is who .....\nNames Randomly Rattled off ---They are\n---> Trixie Segundo / Ivy tabares / Monalyn Luna / Marrielle Barraza /\nCarlou Guevarra / Kiko Cortez \u00a0 Dance IS a Non-Verbal form of Art - Right ?\u00a0 - and so is Photography - Right ? . And at their Highest Levels - wether it be Dance, Music, Painting, Photography or whatever Art Form - It is How Strong it comes across to the Viewer or Listener - that Truly Matters - How the Audience is Compelled, or \"Moved\" - - - How it HITS Home ! - in a manner of speaking - It's about Heart, It's about Soul -\u00a0 It's about Passion - and then Some !!\nNo, no, no - I'm not tryin' to \"sound profound\" here, or anything even remotely close to that - It IS Simply the Truth.\nIf you want to be a True Artist - Isagad Mo Na ! - Commit, Sacrifice and let your Passion Carry you through !\nOne thing I've noticed though, in the broader context of Art\u00a0\u00a0 [history and all]\u00a0 ....... For any artist there is no Greater Reward than Being Acknowledged and Appreciated - Right ?\nBut the Great Ones -\u00a0\nNot only are they Acknowledged and Appreciated\u00a0 ......\nThey are Remembered.\u00a0\nbrosi gonzales", "source": "brosigonzalesphotos"}
