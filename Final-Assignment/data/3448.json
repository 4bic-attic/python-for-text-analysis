About half of Tikkurila Oyj's revenue relates to exports. \n \nIn the negotiations to be started the estimated maximum headcount reduction is 100 persons. The target is to adjust the Finnish personnel to fit current volume level, and to find new, more flexible ways to introduce products and services that fit customers' needs. Moreover, the aim is to change operational and organizational structures and to ensure company's cost competitiveness. \n \n\"Our sales volumes have already for a long time decreased in both Finland and Russia, and we have tried to adapt to this trend without any significant changes in our headcount. However, as the situation in Russia has become more difficult and as both countries' economic situation is very weak, we have to adjust our operations and to carry out structural changes also in Finland,\" states Erkki J\u00e4rvinen , President and CEO of Tikkurila Oyj. \n \nTikkurila Oyj \nErkki J\u00e4rvinen, President and CEO \n \n\nFor further information, please contact: \nErkki J\u00e4rvinen, President and CEO, mobile +358 400 455 913, erkki.jarvinen@tikkurila.com  \n \n\nTikkurila is the leading paints and coatings professional in the Nordic region and Russia.
