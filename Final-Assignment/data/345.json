With an estimated 4 million refugees having fled\u00a0the country since 2011, the United Nations is calling this the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. What may have seemed like nothing more than a\u00a0thinking out loud style tweet has quickly developed into something incredible, sounding more like something out of a movie than a real life response to crisis.\u00a0Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris tweeted the following on September first: Greece or Italy sell me an island,ill call its independence and host the migrants and provide jobs for them building their new country \u2014 Naguib Sawiris (@NaguibSawiris) September 1, 2015 He does recognize that his idea may seem a little crazy and farfetched, but he\u2019s definitely seriously considering it, if his subsequent tweet is any indication. Crazy idea .. Maybe but at least temporary until they can return to their countries ??!! \u2014 Naguib Sawiris (@NaguibSawiris) September 1, 2015 Who Is Naguib Sawaris? Sawaris is the third richest man in Egypt \u2013 with a net worth of 2.9\u00a0billion\u00a0dollars\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0chairman of Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, an international telecommunications company from Cairo. In an interview with CNN, Sawaris said: It\u2019s a very simple solution, they [Italy or Greece] sell the island to me. I\u2019ll make\u00a0a temporary shelter for these people, I\u2019ll make a small port and a\u00a0marina for boats to land there. I\u2019ll employ the people to build their own places, their own houses \u2026 I\u2019ll give them jobs and shelter [until their country is more stable], then once this is done, they can have the choice whether\u00a0either to go back to their country or stay on this island, the problem is in the politicians. \u2026 all I need is the permission to put these people on this island.\u201d\nRelated:\u00a0 The Oracle Report Friday, June 19, 2015\nWhat\u2019s The Catch? So far,\u00a0there doesn\u2019t seem to be one. Sawiris appears to be a genuine man with good intentions who wants to help (and just happens to have a few billion dollars to make it happen). In an interview with Forbes magazine, Sawaris said: \u201cI am serious with my intentions, I want to feel good about having done something good, provide me with the island and I will do the rest. \u201c From reading\u00a0several other twitter posts made by Sawaris, it becomes clear that this kind-hearted man was inspired by the death of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old boy who drowned off the coast of Turkey with his mother and brother. A picture of the boy\u2019s body washed up on shore made media headlines and revealed\u00a0the severity of this refugee crisis to the world. He intends to name the island after the boy. I found a name for the Island \u201cILAN \u201cthe young Syrian child thrown on turkish shore by the sea to remind us ! Now i need to find the Island! \u2014 Naguib Sawiris (@NaguibSawiris) September 5, 2015 Shortly after this tweet was made, another followed with a hashtag Sawiris had created for his endeavour, #aylanISLAND, and a call for volunteers to help with this extrememely ambitious project. #aylanISLAND Everyone who proposed to volunteer or help in creating #aylanISLAND pls email your proposed contribution to proposals@otmt.com \u2014 Naguib Sawiris (@NaguibSawiris) September 7, 2015 Sawaris has many people behind him who\u00a0fully support his idea and want to help. Could it be the solution to this devastating crisis?\nRelated:\u00a0 GERMANY FILES WAR CRIMES AGAINST BUSH, CHENEY, RUMSFELD ET AL\nMuch Love\nAll sources are imbedded within this article. -Alanna Ketler \"According to the \u201cFair Use\u201d clause of International Copyright Law, the authors declare that the use of the photos, videos and information in this academic research are analyzed for purposes of \u201ccriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research\u201d according to Section 107 of Title 17 of the US Code.\"\rRelated", "source": "Galactic Connection"}
