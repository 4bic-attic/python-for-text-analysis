You might think we don\u2019t care, but we ALWAYS do \n\nNurses do a lot of things, and we may be rushing about the ward or flustered. Because we care about you, the first thing to slip is awareness of how we appear to others \n\n, \n\nWe\u2019ve other, more important, things to think about \u2013 like keeping people alive \n\n! \n\n2. That said\u2026 we don\u2019t want you here \n\nIn the nicest possible way, we wish you were at home, where you belong. Hospitals are rubbish places to be, but sometimes we need them and they\u2019re the best place for us. \n\nHowever, home is usually more pleasant, so we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make you feel better, so that you don\u2019t need to be in hospital anymore. \n\nNot to mention, of course, the fact that we want you to feel better. \n\n3. You do matter\u2026 but so do our other patients \n\nWe prioritise our jobs according to need. Yes, you want a glass of water\u2026 but there might be a patient down the hall who\u2019s bleeding, or who\u2019s showing symptoms of a heart attack. \n\nThe most important thing we do is save lives \u2013 so if we\u2019re a bit late bringing you what you\u2019ve asked for, please forgive us\u2026 we can\u2019t always guess when people are going to need us and how much, so we have to think on our feet. \n\n4. We won\u2019t judge you \n\nIt\u2019s in human nature to judge those around us, but nurses have to train themselves out of it. In the UK, it\u2019s even part of the code of conduct set by the Nursing & Midwifery Council, which we have to adhere to in order to register and work as a nurse \u2013 no matter what you tell us, we can\u2019t let it affect how we treat you. \n\nSo, please, be honest with us when we ask you how you are, or for information about your life. It may not seem relevant, but we don\u2019t ask questions to be nosy, and not telling us things could impact our ability to help you get better. \n\n5. Yes, bodies are gross. No, we don\u2019t mind (much). \n\nWhatever your body does (and whether it\u2019s meant to do it or not) \u2013 we\u2019re prepared to handle it. We knew what we were getting into when we chose this career, and yet we do it anyway. You don\u2019t need to feel embarrassed \u2013 you\u2019re far from alone. \n\n6. We don\u2019t want to hurt you or make you uncomfortable \n\nWe know taking blood for a test is painful, that blood pressure cuffs are uncomfortably tight and that you don\u2019t want to wake up every four hours so we can test your vital signs. We know. \n\nPlease understand that if we didn\u2019t have to, we wouldn\u2019t \n\n! \n\n7. We believe you \n\nIf we ask you how much it hurts, and you tell us it\u2019s an 8 when you really mean a 10\u2026 we might not give you the painkillers you need. We know that pain is subjective, so if this really is the worst pain you\u2019ve ever felt? Tell us, and we\u2019ll fix you up with what you need to make it better. We trust you to know. \n\n8. Ask us questions \n\nYour nurse isn\u2019t just the doctor\u2019s lackey \u2013 they should know why\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
