These risk management standards address, among other things, risks associated with the following: exchange-of-value settlement services; DCOs\u2019 link arrangements; the requirement to use central bank services (where available and practicable); and requirements regarding the due diligence on custodian banks. \n\r \nThe interpretation aims to assist DCOs that have been designated systemically important (SIDCOs) or that have opted into the enhanced SIDCO regulatory framework (known as Subpart C DCOs) in their understanding of how certain CFTC regulations apply, consistent with the above mentioned risk management standards in the PFMIs.", "source": "Mondo Visione"}
