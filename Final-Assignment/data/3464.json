In 2006, PBS\u2019 American Masters profiled the namesake CBS newsman as a \u201cWitness to History.\u201d Tomorrow night, at the outset of this new school year, the twain shall meet in the form of a screening of the PBS documentary as part of \u201cCronkite Night at the Movies.\u201d\u00a0The Sept. 2 kick-off selection will be introduced by Cronkite School senior associate dean Marianne Barrett and faculty professor Louise Solheim. When Cronkite passed away in 2009, PBS chatted with the documentary\u2019s director, Catherine Tatge. Among her observations: Q: What did you learn from interviewing Cronkite\u2019s contemporaries? A: A really important point in this documentary is how reporters like Cronkite, and all the other greats I interviewed, were mostly people who came out of print journalism. They were real reporters. And that transition from print to television gave them an understanding of how to find and present a great story. Their print background is reflected in the language they use in their reporting. There\u2019s real writing there. These days, the news media often has to remind readers that so-and-so is not Walter Cronkite. To wit: \u201cJorge Ramos Is Not Walter Cronkite\u201d \u201cMegyn Kelly Is Not Walter Cronkite\u201d Correct, and correct. There was, and only ever will be, one.
