That was enough to best Kevin Harvick, who ran 133.427 mph. \n\nHarvick comes into the second race of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup needing to come up big after a cut tire last week left him 42nd in the race and 15th in points. Speed hasn't been a problem this weekend for Harvick, as he qualified second behind Edwards on Friday in the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Harvick was fastest in 10-consecutive lap average. \n\nThird on the board behind Harvick was Brad Keselowski, who clocked in at 133.399 mph in the No. 2 Team Penske Ford and had the fastest five-lap average. He was followed by his teammate, Joey Logano, the defending race winner. \n\nFifth was Harvick's teammate, Kurt Busch in a second SHR Chevy. Busch's crew chief, Tony Gibson, had an emergency appendectomy Tuesday but is in New Hampshire for the race weekend. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was sixth. \n\nThe final Happy Hour practice runs from 11:30 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. ET. \n\nTake a look at the full practice results and best 10 consecutive lap average", "source": "DailyNews724.com"}
