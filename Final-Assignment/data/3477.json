The action plan identifies 42 key areas where the Government has an essential role to play in advancing the adoption of ITS technology in New Zealand. \n  \n\u201cITS technology will create dramatic improvements in the safety, environmental performance and efficiency of the transport system,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cThe Ministry of Transport is working to ensure New Zealand\u2019s regulatory system and transport infrastructure are ready for new transport technologies to be tested and deployed in New Zealand.\u201d \n \nMatthews is challenging the transport sector to think about how people and freight might travel in future, and how transport technology will create changes. He believes transport technologies will provide new ways to solve transport problems, like traffic congestion, over the next 30 years. \n \n\u201cNew Zealand could be at the forefront of these technological changes, if we play our cards right,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo be at the forefront, we need to be open to new ideas and approaches that intelligent transport systems offer us, and create an environment that enables ITS technology solutions.\u201d \n \nIntelligent transport systems apply information, data processing, communication, and sensor technologies to vehicles (including cars, trucks, trains, aircraft and ships), transport infrastructure and transport users to increase the effectiveness, environmental performance, safety, resilience and efficiency of the transport system.", "source": "Car and SUV"}
