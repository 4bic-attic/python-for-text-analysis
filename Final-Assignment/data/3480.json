Having a total corporate experience of over 20 yrs and having worked with several law firms prior to this and being a practicing advocate, Mamta completed her graduation from the University of Mumbai with dual degrees in B.A, LLB. Mamta hails from Uttarakhand and Rishikesh is her hometown. \n \nBeing a lawyer, writing comes naturally to me. All the while drafting legal documents and writing legal articles, I didn\u2019t think that one day I would be writing stories of the Mahabharat and Ramayan for children. Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, my hometown where the magical moments spent in my childhood by the river Ganga, deeply immersed in reading the great epics to my siblings remained with me through the years. The childhood passion of storytelling resurfaced as I wanted to share the values taught by the great epics. My bookworm son, Shaan was 12 when he first discovered stories from the Mahabharat, and stumbled upon stories of Dronacharya, Arjun and Bhim. After devouring these stories, he decided to read the entire Mahabharata. Our search for a version of the epic that was apt for young readers were either a 100-page book or that was a little lengthy and complex for children of this age group. The thought that our children want to read the stories of our tradition led me to this pursuit\u2026 In that same quest, I present my second book \u201cAn Eternal Hero \u2013 Ram\u201d. It\u2019s the story of Ramayan, and attempts to bridge the ever-growing gap between today\u2019s generation and ancient Indian stories and values. The story teaches us important life lessons without us realizing it. You begin to identify with the characters. The plot, subplots and events have interesting scenes where the truth about human nature in the game of karma, choices, and destinies are showcased. Throughout the plot, you will see that Gods, demons, humans and the other species being driven by their egos. Only to realize that the only power that can bring justice and wellbeing for all is the Supreme One! \n \nSource : Lokesh Shastri", "source": "APN News"}
