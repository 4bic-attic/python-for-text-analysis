In this tiny village of 500 inhabitants tucked away in the jungles of northeast India, women rule. Mawlynnong is home to the indigenous Khasi tribe - one of the few matriarchal and matrilineal societies on earth. Here, women inherit land, children take their mother\u2019s surname, and men marry into their wives\u2019 family homes.

In a society where women are revered and respected, self-confidence flourishes, self-sufficiency blooms, and maturity thrives.
