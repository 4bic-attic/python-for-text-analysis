They were seeking assurances from Beijing officials about how China can calm its turbulent markets and maintain growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. \n \nIn a surprise move last month, the Chinese central bank devalued the yuan, jolting global markets and raising more questions about China\u2019s capability to manage a soft landing. \nSource: Dow Jones", "source": "Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide"}
