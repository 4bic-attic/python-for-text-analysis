See it this weekend at the Filberg Lodge. \n\u2014\u00a0image credit: PHOTO SUBMITTED \n  \nBrian Scott will be featuring his \u201cHarbour Reflection\u201d paintings at his Filberg Lodge showing, and the North Island College Foundation will benefit from the show. \n \nScott\u2019s showing is Saturday and Sunday from 11 till 4 p.m. at Filberg Lodge and Park in Comox, and 10 per cent of all sales will be donated to the NIC Foundation. \n \nScott loves the reactions he gets from people when he flips his Harbour Reflection upside down. \n \nThe distortion of the tidal action on the fish boats suddenly becomes a tightly defined three-dimensional version of the harbour scene. \n \nThe fascination for Scott is the fundamental contrast between organic (nature) and man made which is geometric based on the circle, square and triangle, mostly straight lines. \u00a0Organic forms, distorted by the moving water, move together, curving lines and repetition of forms. Much more exciting to the artist\u2019s eye. Think of Emily Carr\u2019s moving forest or Van Gogh\u2019s distorted landscapes. \n \nScott\u2019s feature painting is called \u201cAutumn Fanfare\u201d and when the painting is turned upside down becomes \u201cCourtenay Slough\u201d - one of Scott\u2019s favourite painting sites. He signs the paintings in both directions. \n \n\u201cThe joke is when you are having a party and your guests aren\u2019t looking turn the painting upside down from realism to abstraction. If they don\u2019t notice the difference then send them home in a taxi,\u201d says Scott.", "source": "BCLocalNews.com"}
