According to a federal study released this month, there were about 20 million students enrolled in 20 4,724 degree-granting institutions in 2013. \n \nA goal was to rank schools according to how much students borrowed and what their job prospects were when they left. In the process, the rankings would shame schools at the bottom into improving the product. \n \nThis time around college ranking is being replaced with the new College Scorecard and will provide data that enables people to do some informed comparison shopping when looking for a college or university. The result was an unprecedented release of new federal data on loan repayment and post-college outcomes. \n \n\u201cAmericans will now have access to reliable data on every institution of higher education,\u201d Obama said in his weekly address on September 12. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see how much each school\u2019s graduates earn, how much debt they graduate with and what percentage of a school\u2019s students can pay back their loans \u2013 which will help all of us see which schools do the best job of preparing America for success.\u201d \n    next   last \u00bb", "source": "Delco Times"}
