Green , who caught 10 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns this past Sunday at Baltimore, today was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week by the NFL. \n \nGreen's 227 yards constitute not only the most receiving yards in a game by any NFL player this season, but also the most yards from scrimmage. The 227 was his career high and the second-most receiving yards in Bengals history, behind Chad Johnson's 260 vs. San Diego in 2006. Green now holds the Nos. 2-3 game receiving yards totals in Bengals history. His previous high, 224 yards last season vs. Pittsburgh, stands third. \n \nGreen's touchdowns last week were both in the fourth quarter. The first, an 80-yarder on which he ran the last 50 yards and eluded two tacklers, erased a 17-14 Bengals deficit. The second, a seven-yarder, erased another deficit and provided the game-winning points in 28-24 decision. \n \nThough he has been a Pro Bowl selection in each of his four full NFL seasons, Green had not previously won an Offensive Player of the Week award. He did win AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for September 2012. \n \nThe last Bengal to win an AFC Player of the Week award was CB Dre Kirkpatrick , for a two-INT performance in Cincinnati's playoff-clinching win vs. Denver in Week 16 of last season. The last Bengal to win an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award was HB Jeremy Hill , who had 169 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs in Week 15 of last season at Cleveland. \n \n( Cincinnati Bengals press release)", "source": "Yard Barker"}
