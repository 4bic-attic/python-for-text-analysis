Pizza Rat was on a mission. \n\n\"He appears poised to complete the descent and return to his squalid rat hole with his unnecessarily large prize -- an inspiring demonstration of the grit and determination one needs to make it in New York City,\" Caroline Bankoff wrote for the Daily Intelligencer. \n\nSuddenly, Pizza Rat was being hailed as \"Carrie Ratshaw\" (a nod to the \"Sex and the City\" character) and an all-around winner at life. There's even a quiz that can determine whether you are Pizza Rat. \n\nThe Internet, of course, has been all embracing it, with \"Watch What Happens Live\" host Andy Cohen speaking for us all when he tweeted simply \"obsessed with #PizzaRat.\" \n\nNaturally, there is already a New York Pizza Rat Twitter account, which offers a simple explanation for the trek: \"Wasn't trying to make a statement, humans. Just trying to get some damn pizza down some subway stairs.\" \n\n [embedded content]", "source": "Idaho8.com"}
