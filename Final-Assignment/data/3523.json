The outage encompassed the areas west and south of Socorro, including San Antonio, Luis Lopez, Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, Bingham and White Sands\u2019 Stallion Site. The blackout also extended west of Socorro, affecting Magdalena and Alamo, Datil, Pie Town, Quemado and everything in between. \n \nThe pole in question was just west of the substation west of the New Mexico Fire Fighting Academy, according to SEC\u2019s Socorro Line Foreman Tony Lopez. \nThe calls started coming in at about 3 p.m., Lopez said. \n \n\u201cWe had guys scheduled out at other projects and calls,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the (outage) calls came in, they were brought in and we started to patrol the \nline, pole by pole, to find the break.\u201d \n \nNo matter what causes an outage, line crews have to physically check the lines, sometimes a matter of miles from a road or highway, but this time they got a call that helped pinpoint the location. \n \n\u201cFortunately, we had a member who called in and said he heard glass breaking,\u201d Lopez said. \n \nThe sound was not the breaking of glass, but that of a porcelain insulator. A cross arm had broken. \n \n\u201cIt was the horizontal timber brace, the cross arm\u201d he said. \u201cEach pole has a horizontal timber cross arm that supports two lines.\u201d \n \nEach transmission line carries 69,000 volts. \n \n\u201cThe failure of that cross arm was the main source of the outage,\u201d Lopez said. \n \nAfter the break was located Lopez contacted Tri-State (Generation and Transmission])to \u201clet them know what we found.\u201d \n \nA switching order then has to take place before a crew can begin to make repairs. \n \n\u201cWe locate where our safety points are so our guys are in a safe environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe isolate the two points and put our personal protection ground up (tying every line to ground). Once we\u2019ve created that we made contact with the supplier and had the material shipped to us at the site\u201d \n \nThen the crew goes up and takes the old cross arm down and attaches the new one. \n \n\u201cWe just reverse the process of switching with Tri-State after replacing the cross arms,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOnce we report back that all men and equip are clear, (and personal grounds removed) I can give the order to go ahead a re-energize the line.\u201d \n \nLopez said discussions were held with Tri-State as to the cause of the cross arm breaking, and it basically came down to wear and tear. \n \n\u201cPossibly windstorms over time weakened the cross arm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put it down as an arm that just went bad.\u201d \n \nThe total affected in District IV was 1,129 customers. In District II and V the outage affected 2,745. \n \n\u00a0", "source": "El Defensor Chieftain"}
