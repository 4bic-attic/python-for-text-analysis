Women hold 20.3 per cent of all board positions of Alberta issuers in the TSX/S&P 60 Index, in-line with the average number of women on boards for the entire TSX/S&P 60 Index (20.8 per cent) according to Catalyst's most recent survey . Of all companies surveyed, 29 per cent have one woman or more on the board of directors; three per cent have three or more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2014, 25 per cent of all companies surveyed had one woman or more on the board of directors; two per cent had three or more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A woman holds the position of Chair in seven companies surveyed. \n\nLoren Falkenberg , Haskayne's associate dean of research and co-chair of the study's advisory committee, said she is pleased to see the growing trend and, with women now making up over 60 per cent of university graduates, it appears the trend should continue. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\"We should see the number of women on corporate boards start to really grow, \" she said. \n\nFalkenberg said the new data sheds light on the increase of female representation on Alberta corporate boards, which is particularly important given a growing expectation from the public that boards have more diverse representation. Falkenberg said the recent launch of the Canadian chapter of the 30 Percent Club , which set a goal to have 30 per cent of board seats held by women by 2019, is an example of the expectation that boards should strive for greater gender parity. \n\n\"With this new data, as researchers we now have a better understanding of who is sitting at the table in corporate boardrooms,\" said Falkenberg. \n\nBill Rice , chair and chief executive officer of the ASC, said the organization encourages strong boards comprised of the most qualified individuals. \n\n\"Many investors favour the inclusion of diverse perspectives on corporate boards, and we are publishing this data to encourage an informed and beneficial public discussion about the participation of women on boards in Alberta ,\" said Mr. Rice. \n\nThe Alberta Women on Boards Index benefits from an Advisory Committee comprised of senior business leaders who oversee its development. In addition to Falkenberg, the committee members include: \nTrudy Curran , Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Canadian Oil Sands Limited Wendy Hanrahan , Executive Vice President, Corporate Services, TransCanada Corporation Linda Hohol , Corporate Director and former President of the TSX Venture Exchange Byron Neiles , Senior Vice President, Major Projects , Enterprise Safety and Operational Reliability, Enbridge Inc.
