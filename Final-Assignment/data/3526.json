TriORE \u2013 Victory Rising lyrics\nVictory is rising and the world has turned insane\nSleeping dogs are waking and the little children pray\nDying suns are setting in a sky of raging war\nWe think about the good times while we perish with before\n\"I bring you lies, I bring with me\nA dream that only, we can see\nI bring eyes; I bring you teeth\nI have a dream, reserved for me\"\nVictory is rising with the advent of the tide\nBroken men are crying while they stagger in the night\nStorm clouds are ascending where the falling stars collide\nWalking through the fires to the sound of life that dies\nLyrics taken from http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/triore/victory_rising.html\nExplanations\nnew\nTo explain lyrics, select line or word and click \"Explain\".\nMeanings\nShare\nlink: Embed: Email\nPrint\nCorrect\nAdd song structure elements Click \"Correct\" to open the \"Correction form\".
