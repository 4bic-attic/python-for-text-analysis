The free trees are part of the nonprofit Arbor Day Foundation's Trees for America campaign, a program dedicated to environmental stewardship through the planting of trees. Everyone who joins the Arbor Day Foundation in October will receive 10 free autumn classics or other trees selected for your area: two sugar maples, two red maples, and one each of scarlet oak, sweetgum, northern red oak, silver maple, white flowering dogwood, and Washington hawthorn. \"Members will especially enjoy these trees during the autumn months because they'll add abundant, vibrant color to any yard or landscape for years to come,\" said Matt Harris, chief executive of the Arbor Day Foundation. The trees will be shipped postpaid at the right time for planting, between Nov. 1 and Dec. 10. The 6- to 12-inch trees are guaranteed to grow or they will be replaced free of charge. Planting instructions will be enclosed with each shipment of trees. To receive 10 free autumn classics, send a $10 membership contribution to Autumn Classics Trees, Arbor Day Foundation, 100 Arbor Ave., Nebraska City, NE 68410, by Oct. 31, 2015, or join online at arborday.org/october .", "source": "McPherson Sentinel"}
