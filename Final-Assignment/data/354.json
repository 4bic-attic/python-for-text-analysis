He raised the number of those eligible to vote to 13 (12 councilors plus himself as presiding officer). \n \nHe arrived at eight as majority number using the formula of \u201chalf plus one\u201d then rounding it off. \n \nNobody voted against granting Rockwell and Lumber a franchise. The five other councilors present merely opted to abstain. They were councilors Armand Parcon, Jason Gonzales, Ed Pe\u00f1aredondo, R Leone Gerochi, and Lex Tupas. \n \nThe seven councilors who voted in favor of Rockwell and Lumber were Acap, Rodel Fullon Agado, Joshua Alim, Jay Tre\u00f1as, Reyland Hervias, Lady Julie Grace Baronda, and Liezel Zulueta-Salazar. \n \n\u201cNakakuha kami seven votes, which is more than half of 12,\u201d said Acap. \n \nEspinosa could not be reached for comment as of this writing. \n \nCouncilor Alim also had the same position as Acap\u2019s. He said right after the voting on Tuesday that the SP presiding officer can only vote if there\u2019s a tie in the voting. There was none on Tuesday. \n \nLast week, the SP granted Iloilo Sportsmen, Inc. a franchise to operate the Iloilo Coliseum as a cockpit arena. \n \nThe coliseum is located in Barangay San Isidro, Jaro district and is the frequent venue of big-time cock derbies in Iloilo City, notably the Candelaria derby every district fiesta of Jaro. \n \nAcap believes that more cockpits can deliver huge financial revenues to Iloilo City. Two months ago he introduced a measure allowing the operation of cockpits in the city\u2019s six districts \u2013 excluding the City Proper \u2013 but it failed to gather support from fellow councilors./ PN", "source": "Panay News"}
