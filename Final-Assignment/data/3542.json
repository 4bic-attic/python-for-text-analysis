The Du Tonc cohort\u00a0blessed us with two original cuts over the summer, but follows up \u2018Dusk\u2019 and \u2018Luna\u2019 with a brand new offering\u00a0for Continental Records\u00a0and their latest batch of remixes for \u2018Fastlane.\u2019 \n\nThis thick cut groover dons some irresistible\u00a0disco hallmarks, all whilst keeping things on par with\u00a0a tasteful blend of conventional indie dance and nostalgic songmanship.\u00a0The only thing even remotely repetitive about Mighty Mouse\u2019s output of late is the upfront quality he brings to the table, an asset we are yet to grow tired of. If you\u2019re looking for an indicator life beyond the wobbles and claps of European house music for the late summer run, this take on \u2018Fastlane\u2019 is an obvious starting point. \n \n Release Date: September 11 \n\nRomuald & Madji\u2019k \u2013 Fastlane (Mighty Mouse Remix) was posted by Dan Roy Carter , and appeared first on Dancing Astronaut .", "source": "Dancing Astronaut"}
