The Cougars ultimately got the final word in the back-and-forth contest thanks to their mobile junior QB and special teams, which partially blocked John Wallace's 53-yard field goal attempt with 54 seconds remaining to seal the signature win for first-year coach Tom Herman.\n\nHouston (2-0) outgained Louisville 462-395 and recorded four turnovers and broke a three-game losing streak to the Cardinals (0-2). Brandon Wilson also returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.\n\nWard combined for 334 yards on offense, completing 23 of 33 attempts for 236 yards with one interception. He also carried 21 times for 98 yards.", "source": "Kentucky.com"}
