Midway through the fourth quarter, Adams scrambled up the middle and slid to complete a seven-yard gain before Eastern Washington linebacker John Kreifels crashed late into Adams' head. After the hit, Adams lay flat on the turf momentarily before being helped off the field. He was escorted off the field by team doctor Greg Skaggs and replaced by backup Jeff Lockie. Adams later returned to the Oregon sideline, and coach Mark Helfrich implied after the game that Adams did not suffer a concussion, and Adams said he planned to play at Michigan State. Helfrich implied Vernon Adams Jr. doesn't have a concussion. \u2014 Andrew Greif (@AndrewGreif) September 6, 2015 Kreifels was ejected from the game for targeting Adams. As Kreifels walked off the field he taunted the Oregon crowd before being grabbed and yelled at by Eastern's coaches.\u00a0 The Ducks led 54-35 at the time. Adams played for three seasons at Eastern before transfering to Oregon in August.\u00a0 Here's the video:\u00a0 HOLY CHEAP SHOT BATMAN! Gotta think this was personal from former teammate. pic.twitter.com/5von60N1tk \u2014 Lost Lettermen (@LostLettermen) September 6, 2015", "source": "Oregon Ducks Football"}
