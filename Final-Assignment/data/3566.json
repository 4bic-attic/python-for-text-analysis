Briggs is a recipient of a 2015 Department of Art & Design Student Summer Research Award. \n \nAbout the Student Summer Research Award \n \nThe Student Summer Research Award is sponsored by the Austin Peay State University\u00a0Department of Art & Design and the Center of Excellence in the Creative Arts. It was established to\u00a0create opportunities for selected art students to conduct studio research during the summer\u00a0when they might not be registered for classes. The award provides\u00a0$2500\u00a0to two students\u00a0who propose a well conceived and intriguing body of work. \n \nAmber Briggs \u00a0used the funds to create a body of collaborative works based on her family dynamic. In her proposal she stated \u201cTruly at the heart of this motivation are motherhood and my relationship with my four year old son, Parker\u201d. \u00a0She is inspired by her son\u2019s creativity and way of looking at the world.", "source": "department of art - apsu"}
