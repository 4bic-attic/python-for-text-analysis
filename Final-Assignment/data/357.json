So we'd like to get some feedback from our readers in order to continue bringing you what you want to see. \n  \n\nOur 2015 reader survey gives you the chance to let us know what content you want to read more of and what you want to read less of, as well as suggesting other topics you would find the most useful. We have some big plans for the future of the PA Life brand, so it's important to us to listen to what our readers want and need from our magazine and website. \n\nTo take part in the survey, simply visit surveymonkey.com/r/9V5QZ7R . It's very short and your answers will be fully considered as we continue to grow and develop as a brand. \n\nThank you for your continued support.", "source": "Executary News"}
