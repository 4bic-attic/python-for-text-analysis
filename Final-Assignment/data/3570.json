Abortions are a small part of Planned \nParenthood\u2019s services, making it a perennial target for \nanti-abortion forces among conservative Republicans. \n \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would \nvote on Thursday on a continuing resolution keeping federal \nagencies funded through Dec. 11 and giving Congress time to work \nout a longer-term budget deal. \n \nMcConnell\u2019s measure would try strip the portion of Planned \nParenthood funding from discretionary programs. Democrats were \nexpected to block that version of the bill. \n \nPlanned Parenthood, a non-profit group, has been under fire \nfor weeks after secretly taped videos produced by an \nanti-abortion group recorded Planned Parenthood officials \ndiscussing the use of fetal tissue harvested from abortions. \n \nConservative Republicans have called for an end to the \ngroup\u2019s current funding of about $500 million a year. Most of \nthat comes from Medicaid healthcare reimbursements that do not \ndepend on annual spending bills. McConnell\u2019s bill would attack a \nmuch smaller portion, about $50 million. \n \n(Additional reporting by David Lawder ; Editing by Eric Walsh \nand Cynthia Osterman)", "source": "Susan Cornwell"}
