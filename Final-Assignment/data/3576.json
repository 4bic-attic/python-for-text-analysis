They were protesting against the impending budget cuts for state universities and colleges in 2016, including the P2.2 billion budget cut for UP. \n \nWhen the group reached General Luna Street, about 200 riot police stopped them from marching onwards to the Iloilo Provincial Capitol and proceeded to violently disperse the rally. \n \nThe police then arrested 11 protest leaders, including Bryan Bosque and Gabyel Guillen of Anakbayan-Panay, UP Visayas faculty Erick Dasig Aguilar and Gretchen Velarde, Iglesia Filipina Independiente Diocese of Iloilo Vicar General Fr. Marco Sulayao, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan-Panay Chair Hope Hervilla, and Karapatan-Panay Secretary General Reylan Vergara. \n \n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms the violent dispersal of the anti-budget cut protest in UP Visayas. We note in particular how the government is increasing using an iron fist against legitimate peaceful assemblies in Iloilo, mostly after to the city\u2019s hosting of one of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial meetings,\u201d Kabataan Partylist Spokesperson Sarah Elago said. \n \n\u201cThe state violence exercised by the Aquino administration against the protesters is reminiscent of the dark days of Martial Law, when even legitimate issues and concerns were met with state violence. It is deeply alarming and ironic that the Aquino administration confidently inflicts violence against peaceful protesters just a few days after the nation commemorated the 43rd anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law,\u201d Elago added. \n \nThe arrested protesters were only released from detention a little past 1:00 a.m. today.", "source": "Kabataan Partylist"}
