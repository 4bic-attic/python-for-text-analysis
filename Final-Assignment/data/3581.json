It is not about oppressing free speech or stifling academic freedom, it is about making sure that radical views and ideas are not given the oxygen they need to flourish. \n \n\u201cSchools, universities and colleges, more than anywhere else, have a duty to protect impressionable young minds and ensure that our young people are given every opportunity to reach their potential. That is what our one nation government is focused on delivering.\u201d \n \nThis follows on from some 70 events in the past year, which involved hate preachers. \n \nSome universities have blocked speakers in the past year, such as anti-gay imam\u00a0Haitham al-Haddad, who had been set to speak at the University of Westminster and Kent University. \n \nUniversities will, from 21 September, have a legal duty to put in place policies to block extremists from radicalising students.", "source": "Pink News"}
