It is part of the company's overall objective to empower research-oriented clinical teams to accelerate the development of new treatment techniques and processes designed to improve outcomes for cancer patients. \n\n\"When Varian introduced the TrueBeam platform in 2010, we included Developer Mode, an optional non-clinical development tool for researchers to use in pioneering and prototyping new treatment techniques,\" said Corey Zankowski \n\nIn a separate development, the OncoPeer online forum, first launched last March in select geographic areas, is now accessible to Varian customers worldwide. Since March, users have established discussion groups on topics like oncology analytics, knowledge-based treatment planning, treatment planning using Eclipse\u2122 software, and the physics of radiotherapy. One discussion group focuses on how to use Varian's ARIA\u00ae information system to manage a medical oncology department. Other groups share information about Varian treatment delivery platforms. \n\n\"OncoPeer is a place for customers to find others who use Varian technology and learn from one another,\" said Sukhveer Singh \n\nVarian held an online seminar about Navigating OncoPeer last May. Interested clinicians can view a replay of the webcast at this registration website. Customers can access OncoPeer at www.oncopeer.com (registration required).\n\nAbout Varian Medical SystemsVarian Medical Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, California \n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nExcept for historical information, this news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
