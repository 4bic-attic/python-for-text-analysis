Fales spent much of last year on the practice squad, too, before being promoted late in the season. The Bears drafted Fales in the sixth round in 2014. Cutler was injured while trying to make a tackle on a Tony Jefferson interception return last Sunday vs. the Cardinals, leaving Jimmy Clausen as the starter for now and making the promotion of Fales the logical next move. Cornerback Bryce Callahan was waived to make room for Fales. The Bears also announced a series of other practice squad moves, signing cornerback Demontre Hurst and wide receiver Deontre Thompson and releasing wide receiver Emugedi Umodu from the practice squad.", "source": "ProFootballTalk"}
