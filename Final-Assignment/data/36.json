Rollins has been unable to hit or play the field in five games this week because of a tender right index finger. \n\nMeanwhile Seager is batting .448 with an on-base percentage of.568 through his first nine major league games. He went 4 for 4 with a home run and stole a base in the Dodgers\u2019 win Saturday. He\u2019s reached base in all nine of his plate appearances the last two days. \n  \nOnce Rollins returns, however, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said the plan for Seager \u201calways has been to play him some at short and give Jimmy days, give (Justin Turner) days at third. He\u2019s played more than we thought from the standpoint of injuries and he\u2019s done a good job. \n\nWhile he\u2019s been praised for his defense and leadership, Rollins also ranks last among qualified National League shortstops in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage (.279). \n\nThe 36-year-old is available to pinch run, but hasn\u2019t been cleared to bat or play the field. Mattingly said there\u2019s no timetable for Rollins to return. \n  \nSeager, meanwhile, continues to impress. His home run was the second-hardest hit by a Dodger this season at 110 mph. \n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t make me nervous,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cHe\u2019s got that (Adrian Gonzalez) heartbeat. It\u2019s slow. He\u2019ll live to be 108, I bet.\u201d \n\nMattingly has shunned any questions about potential playoff roster scenarios so far. But with the Dodgers\u2019 magic number to clinch the division nearing single digits (14), the battle for the final NLDS roster spots will soon be a main focal point of the season. \n  \nEven if he doesn\u2019t supplant Rollins as the starting shortstop this season, Seager could still make an impact as a reserve. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be really good,\u201d Mattingly said, \u201cand he is really good.\u201d \nPuig not in the house \nWhy isn\u2019t Yasiel Puig at Chase Field? \n\nGood question. \n\n\u201cI expected him to be here, honestly,\u201d Mattingly said. \n\nPuig is rehabbing a strained right hamstring at Camelback Ranch in nearby Glendale. He hasn\u2019t played since Aug. 27. While the team hasn\u2019t reported any setbacks in Puig\u2019s rehab, \u201che\u2019s not working out on the field; he\u2019s working out in water and the Alter-G.\u201d \n \n\r\r \n  \nAs baseball activities go, Puig isn\u2019t doing any less than pitcher Brandon McCarthy, for one, who\u2019s out for the season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. But McCarthy is with his teammates in the clubhouse and the dugout during games. \n\nPuig, who\u2019s rehabbing a half-hour away, is not. \n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s invited,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is he\u2019s welcome.\u201d \n\nMattingly said that Puig will return to Los Angeles with the team when it flies home tomorrow night. \nAlso \nKik\u00e9 Hernandez (strained left hamstring) ran on the field prior to the game. \u2026 Howie Kendrick (strained left hamstring) will get 10 at-bats Monday and Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in live batting practice. He is still unable to run at full speed, though \u201chis time was pretty good, faster than the day before,\u201d according to Mattingly. \u2026 Condolences to the family of Dodger Stadium chef Dave Pearson, who died at age 75. He had been battling lung cancer.", "source": "SGV Tribune"}
