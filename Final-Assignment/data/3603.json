The infrastructure is dedicated within a data center (DCaaS) and invoicing takes place according to a fixed-rate model for greater cost control. In the event of a need for additional capacity, users can at any time overflow (hybrid cloud) onto the public cloud for limited operations.\n\nWhat's more, Ikoula is committed to providing its clients with the high-quality 24/7 support and accompaniment that has been central to the firm's success.\n\nWith the opening of its second data center in France \n\nTo celebrate its international expansion, Ikoula's public cloud is free for a period of 6 months, only available for the 100 first registrants, with a limitation of 100\u20ac/month (exclusive of VAT).\n\nLearn more: https://express.ikoula.com/en/public-cloud\n\nAbout Ikoula:\n\nIkoula has been specializing in ICT hosting, dedicated servers and the French cloud since 1998.
