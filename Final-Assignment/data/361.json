But let me make clear that we will only recommend consent if the accompanying fiscal framework is also fair to Scotland.\" \n\nThe SNP leader set out her programme for government just less than a year after Scots rejected independence in the referendum, opting instead to remain part of the UK. \n\nShe spoke about how she wanted to \" harness the passion and energy shown in the referendum, and use it to tackle the social and economic issues of our times\". \n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The referendum debate also revealed a deep yearning for a fairer society, as well as a more prosperous economy. \n\n\"This ambitious and reforming programme for government speaks to those aspirations. It sets out how this government will work - now and in the long term - to achieve our vision for Scotland's future.\n\n\"It demonstrates how enduring values - a belief in enterprise, a faith in the value of education, a commitment to fairness and solidarity, and a passion for democratic engagement - can be applied to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous country.\"\n\nWith Holyrood also due to get new powers over taxation, Ms Sturgeon confirmed Air Passenger Duty will be cut by 50% by the end of the next parliament, if the SNP wins next year's Holyrood elections.\n\nMinisters are consulting with business leaders and others on further tax powers, with the First Minister saying her Government would set out its intentions in the forthcoming Budget Bill.\n\nShe also said changes would be made to make Police Scotland more accountable.\n\nThe national police force has been hit by a number of controversies, with independent investigations under way in to the death in custody of Fife man Sheku Bayoh along with officers' failure to respond to reports of a fatal crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire. \n\nMs Sturgeon said there would be a review of police governance at national level, along with measures to improve the accountability and scrutiny of policing at a local level. \n\n\"For example, there will be a new requirement on the Chief Constable to attend local public scrutiny sessions,\" she said. \n\n\"A local scrutiny Summit to be held this month will identify further ways to enhance local accountability. And local scrutiny committees, together with members of the public and the parliament, will also have an important role to play in updating our national policing priorities.\" \n\nAny recommendations result from the review of police call handling will be implemented, Ms Sturgeon said, adding that a statutory code of practice on stop and search will also be introduced. \n\nOn housing Ms Sturgeon announced there would be an additional \u00a3195 million for the Help To Buy scheme, which assists those buying new build properties, over the next three years.\n\nTo help the rental sector, the Scottish Government will bring in a Private Tenancies Bill, which will include provisions for rent controls to be brought in in certain areas.\n\nNew systems of GP care will be trialled in at least 10 sites across Scotland over the next year, with the First Minister stating: \" We will support GPs to work in clusters and develop new ways of working with district nurses, health visitors, community rehabilitation teams and health improvement services, and using different services such as intermediate care beds.\" \n\nShe pledged \u00a3100 million of spending to improve mental health services, particularly for children and young people, and said work to integrate health and social care services should be complete by next April. \n\nThe First Minister said new legislation would be brought in to strengthen the law on domestic abuse, with the proposed Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Bill also creating a new offence to tackle the problem of people sharing private pictures of former partners in so-called \"revenge porn\" cases.", "source": "Falkirk Herald"}
