We've got four pool matches to get through and hopefully we can move on from there but we've got to play some good rugby.\" \n\nThe 24-year-old's partnership with Sam Whitelock, with Luke Romano in reserve, is such that Steve Hansen and his coaches have opted to take only three locks. \n\nJerome Kaino and Victor Vito will be used as possible lock cover, their versatility allowing the All Blacks to take an extra loose forward - a traditionally injury-prone position - while allowing for extra speed on the bench. Retallick insisted he was happy with the potential extra workload and his ability to play through pain was probably one of the reasons Hansen decided to take only three specialist second-rowers. \n\n\r- Rotorua Daily Post", "source": "New Zealand Herald"}
