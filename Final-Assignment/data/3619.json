Lack of time is of course a good excuse, but what really stopped me is lack of space. All my walls are full of paintings and then I have some who never seen a wall and are just waiting to be seen.\nAs all my walls are full I fall asleep every night with them in sight, which always makes me itch to start painting again.\nI am now slowly reorganizing my little house and am going to make the time and space to start painting again as I enjoyed it so much, and we all can use some extra joy in our life's.\nApologies for the crooked hanging paintings, I will be changing the composition of the paintings soon and will hang them all straight!\nI will slowly un-dust my brushes and paints and get going, starting is half the work, I need to make that jump!\nAs for making space I decided to sell a few of my paintings, with some I am not ready to part (yet), and for now there are only two in the shop but I will be listing more the coming days, so check out the paintings section in our decor shop if you are interested.\nI started with some vibrant geometric ones, some portraits will follow soon!", "source": "Star of the East"}
