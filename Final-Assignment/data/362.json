Cable band is now finished; on the other side there are the beginning and ending edges waiting for me to graft them together so that the whole thing appears seamless.  Then I get to pick up a hundred and some stitches around the top edge of the cable band and start knitting upwards again.  Gonna leave those two tasks for the weekend when I can do it in the brightest daylight.", "source": "The Bibliophile"}
