It takes a while for me to get all decorated but then it is so nice to turn off the lights and just sit with all the Christmas lights on. This is a favorite of mine. \u00a0Saw this tree many years ago in a Pottery Barn magazine. \u00a0Stole the idea and have loved it every year. \u00a0Filled with photos of our families memories from the year. \u00a0Santa is one of our latest additions. \u00a0He is the cutest thing ever and makes me so happy walking by him. We have a few nativities but I love the placement of this one. \u00a0When you walk in you can see the bright light shinning on it. \u00a0We are ready to enjoy the Christmas season.", "source": "The Roberts Family"}
