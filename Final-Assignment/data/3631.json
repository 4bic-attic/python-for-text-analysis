So major I can't say it out loud, let alone write it in this post. Just use your imagination. I am preemptively FREAKING out. How to feel better? Retail therapy? Psychotherapy? Plastic Surgery? I watched \"Advanced Style\" on Netflix. And I felt much better. You see many people fear advancing age. They worry that they will be marginalized, unemployed, infirm, unattractive. Me, I am shallow. I worry about not being cool. And Advanced Style - which started as an equally wonderful blog - reassured me that I don't have to worry. The brain child of blogger Ari Seth Cohen, it chronicles the stylish get-ups of a crowd that\u2019s largely ignored by the fashion system - people over 50. In the process of watching the movie and reading the blog I was elevated. And you will be too. Even if you don't have a major birthday coming up.", "source": "iWebU"}
