Chris Reunites With Baby Royalty On Tour! \n \nThe good news is Chris gets one-year-old Royalty , who is now officially \"Royalty Brown\", 12 days out of the month with no supervised visitation. The fact that Brown won't be monitored during his visits with the tyke is a big win considering Nia previously alleged that she didn't feel their baby was safe with the rapper. \n \nOn Guzman's end, she managed to get C.B. to pay for Royalty's nannies, schooling, and medical bills. Not to mention Breezy was ordered to pay Nia $2,500 a month in addition to $15,000 of backed child support. \n \nHopefully this settlement ends all of the feuding between the ex-lovers \u2014 it's the last thing the little girl needs in her life ! \n \n[ Image via Instagram . ] \n \nTags: chris brown , legal matters , nia guzman , royalty \n   Email this \u00a0 \u00bb  ';\n\n    perez_set_social_icons_for_post_image('464529', ph_share_464529);", "source": "Perez Hilton"}
