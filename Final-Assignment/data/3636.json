Every Friday, I have the opportunity to share my passion and love for everything vintage in the Classic Hollywood newsletter. Sit back and enjoy what\u2019s new in classic films and TV, on DVD and Blu-ray, fun events around town, movie and TV milestones, notable births and deaths.\nThis week, Fathom and\u00a0Turner Classic Movies have teamed up for special theatrical engagements Sept. 20 and 23 of\u00a0Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s influential 1960 thriller \u201cPsycho,\u201d starring Anthony Perkins in his iconic turn as the ultimate mother\u2019s boy, Norman Bates, and the Oscar-nominated\u00a0Janet Leigh as the ill-fated Marion Crane. If you never have seen this shocker on the big screen, this is a wonderful opportunity to see a great print complete with an introduction by TCM host Ben Mankiewicz.\nComedy duo Bud Abbott, left, and Lou Costello. (MCA TVA)\nFive years ago, I chatted with the late Hilton A. Green, who was the film\u2019s assistant director. According to Green, it wasn\u2019t really the brutal shower stabbing that caused problems with censors; it was the sight of a toilet.\n\u201cThey wanted to cut the shot of the toilet where Janet Leigh tears up the note and flushes it down the toilet,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t show a toilet on screen. Can you imagine that?\u201d\nHitch opted to shoot the film in black-and-white with a lower budget than that of his usual productions.\n\u201cHe was still shooting \u2018North by Northwest\u2019 when he started to prepare \u2018Psycho,\u2019\u201d recalled Green, who became a producer. \u201cNorth by Northwest\" was his \u201cbiggest-budget movie at that time, and he wanted to prove to Hollywood that he could make a quality low-budget movie, which was\u00a0 the script of \u2018Psycho.'\u201d\nGreen noted that the Master of Suspense was actually an introvert.\n\u201cMr. Hitchcock had a TV crew and a feature crew,\u201d Green said.\u00a0 \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel comfortable around new faces. That\u2019s\u00a0 why he always kept his same crew intact. When he went do to \u2018Psycho,\u2019 he felt with the budget and the schedule \u2018Psycho\u2019 had, his TV crew was the better choice to do it.\u201dA welcome return\nI\u2019m always wistful when I drive by the Fine Arts Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Though the Art Deco gem from 1937 is occasionally used for screenings, it has been basically closed for several years. I have such fond memories of going to films there when I first moved to California -- especially attending a lively matinee of the 1930s Errol Flynn classics \u201cCaptain Blood\u201d and\u00a0 \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood.\u201d But good news!\nThe\u00a0Laemmle chain, which operated the theater from 1985 to 1993, has welcomed the Fine Arts back into the fold. Laemmle has renamed it the Ahrya Fine Arts and is reopening it Friday with the documentary \u201cJeremy Scott: The People\u2019s Designer.\u201dDon\u2019t touch that dial\nWho\u2019s on TCM Friday night? None other than\u00a0Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. TCM is screening several of the legendary team\u2019s Universal comedy hits, including its 1941 blockbuster \u201cBuck Privates,\u201d which features the Andrew Sisters singing the Oscar-nominated \u201cBoogie Woogie Bugle Boy\u201d; 1941\u2019s \u201cHold That Ghost\u201d and \u201cIn the Navy\u201d; 1942\u2019s \u201cRio Rita\u201d; and 1944\u2019s \u201cLost in a Harem.\u201d\u2019\nActress Janet Leigh in the famous shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller \"Psycho.\" (AP)\nThough most of the comedy teams of that time, including the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges and the\u00a0Ritz Brothers, appealed to the male of the species, Abbott and Costello have always had a strong female following.\n\u201cWe have a lot of women in the fan club,\u201d Lou\u2019s daughter, Chris Costello, once told me.\u00a0 \u201cOf course, it\u2019s because Dad\u2019s so cute and naive, you just want to mother him. People were a little bit more prone to build empathy for Dad because he was always getting slapped around. He was sweet. He was like a little boy who didn\u2019t grow up.\u201d\nThough her father got most of the laughs in their films,\u00a0Chris Costello praised Abbott as \u201cthe ultimate straight man. Unfortunately, he never received the accolades he should have. Bud Abbott was one of the most gentle human beings\u00a0 on the face of the planet.\u201d\nThe duo loved to pull pranks on their sets. \u201cThey would cellophane the toilets,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had people around them from burlesque to keep the energy level up. Dad and Bud were two of the people who were initiators of the wrap party.\u201dAround town\nThe\u00a0American Cinematheque\u2019s Aero Theatre is celebrating the 40th anniversary of\u00a0Robert Altman\u2019s masterpiece \u201cNashville\u201d on Friday evening. Ronee Blakley, who earned a supporting actress Oscar nomination, and music supervisor Richard Baskin will be on hand to discuss the film. The evening will also pay tribute to the late Jerry Weintraub, who was an executive producer of the influential ensemble film that earned five Oscar nominations, winning best song for\u00a0Keith Carradine\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Easy.\u201d\nRonee Blakley and Henry Gibson star in Robert Altman's \"Nashville,\" which follows the lives of two dozen characters over a five-day period. (Paramount Pictures / LACMA)Sneak peek\nIn this Sunday\u2019s Classic Hollywood, I look at the accomplishments of the renowned UCLA Film & Television Archive, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, as well as some of the special fall programming commemorating the milestone.
