Coach Todd Bowles said Friday that he needs to see \"a little more\" from Cromartie, who was injured last Sunday in the Jets' season-opening win against Cleveland. \n\nRookie linebacker Lorenzo Mauldin (concussion) and cornerback Darrin Walls (hamstring) didn't practice and appear unlikely to play. \n\nRookie wide receiver Devin Smith (ribs) was a full participant and will be a game-time decision. \n\nGuards James Carpenter (back) and Willie Colon (knee), running back Chris Ivory (groin) and safety Jaiquawn Jarrett (shoulder) were limited, but are expected to play.", "source": "Bellingham Herald"}
