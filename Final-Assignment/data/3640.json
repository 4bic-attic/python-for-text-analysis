When he arrived at the next station in Kowloon Tong, uniformed staff were waiting on the platform to catch him for carrying luggage they considered to be oversized. \n \n\u201cThey measured the cello case which they said exceeded the official length limit of 130cm by 4cm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then a woman came to my rescue and challenged them for double standards as there were other passengers with large carry-ons in the train.\u201d \n \n\u201cSo they took me to a small room and brought in a senior officer who issued me a warning letter which stipulated that further violation would result in prosecution and a fine of up to HK$2,000.\u201d \n \nThe student offered to pay extra fare for the cello, but the staff refused, informing him that MTR tickets were for passengers only, not luggage. \n \nAfter half an hour in the room, Ho was escorted to a station exit. When he asked them how he could get to Kowloon Bay for his rehearsal, the staff said it was his business as they were not obliged to offer him advice on alternative transportation. \n \nHo ended up taking the MTR again, risking a second warning, but he chose another entrance to the station and boarded the Kwun Tong Line without a problem. \n \nThis is the third such incident in a week on the MTR. Last week, a schoolgirl carrying a guzheng, or Chinese zither, was stopped at Tai Wai Station. A few days later, another student carrying his a cello in a case was refused entry at Hung Hom station. \n \nREAD MORE:\u00a0MTR staff \u2018turning a selective blind eye\u2019 to bulky goods on trains, says Hong Kong anti-parallel trading group \n \nAll three incidents involved only students, not music professionals. There are 19 cellists among the city\u2019s major orchestras, but so far they haven\u2019t made similar complaints. \n \n\u201cHong Kong is not a cultural desert as some people say but when things like this happen one cannot but wonder where is culture in Hong Kong,\u201d said Tung Hiu-lo, Ho\u2019s cello teacher and the principal gehu, or Chinese cello, of the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. \n \n\u201cAll I can do to comfort my student is to wait and see if the principal cellist of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra will be stopped in the MTR for his cello case.\u201d \n \nLaurent Perrin, assistant principal cellist of the Hong Kong Sinfonietta, said he had never had any problem with his cello on board the MTR since he came to Hong Kong 17 years ago. \n \n\u201cThis is something unheard of in any part of the world and I find it hard to believe,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cWhat would happen if all the cellists can\u2019t make it to rehearsals and concerts because we are not allowed to carry our instruments on the MTR?\u201d \n \nThe cellist suggested Ho report yesterday\u2019s incident to his school so that professors could raise the issue with the authorities. \n \nAccording to Ho, there are about 30 cello students in Baptist University\u2019s music department who travel every day to school with their instruments. \n \n\u201cI have no idea how we are going to school and performances with our instruments in any way other than by the MTR,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not mad at the staff. I am mad at the regulations.\u201d", "source": "South China Morning Post"}
