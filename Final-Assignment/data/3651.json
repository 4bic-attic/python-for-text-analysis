Richard\u3000Corcoran\u3000was unanimously designated the next speaker of the Florida House Wednesday, he lived up to his promise to call for controversial reforms aimed at \u201ccleaning up our own house\u201d and policies such as universal school vouchers. \n\n\u201cThe enemy is not the special interests. The enemy is not the press. The enemy is not any of that stuff,\u201d Corcoran, R-Land O\u2019Lakes, told the Republican-controlled chamber. \u201cThe enemy has always been and will always be us.\u201d \n\nHe laid out what he said is the truth about elected office in Tallahassee: politicians who campaign on one thing and \u201cdo another thing once elected;\u201d elected officials who start seeking higher office as soon as they are sworn in; others who use their office to seek well-paying jobs \u201cwhich we would never have gotten but for our service;\u201d and others who \u201cpander\u201d to the press, avoid tough decisions and cave \u201cto the special interests.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhen the political process is more accountable to the people, then, and only then, can we really begin to positively transform the lives of the people in our state,\u201d he said. \n\nHe then ticked off a list of reforms that he said would ideally be changed in law but which he will first pursue by rule: \n\n\u25aa\u00a0 Create more transparency in government by requiring every lobbyist \u201cto disclose which bills, which amendments and which appropriations they are trying to influence.\u201d \n\n\u25aa\u00a0 Ban elected officials from taking jobs in government for six years after they leave office to \u201cend the practice of legislators padding their pensions.\u201d \n\n\u25aa\u00a0 Prohibit legislators from being able to take a job with any company or group that receives any funding from the state to \u201cbuild an absolute firewall between our private lives and the influence of special interests.\u201d \n\n\u25aa\u00a0 And close the \u201crevolving door between the Legislature and the lobbying corps\u201d by passing a constitutional amendment that bans legislators from lobbying for six years after they leave office. Corcoran has planned his slate of proposed reforms for years, working with the 28 fellow Republicans who were elected in 2010 with him and drafting them in a document he calls \u201cThe Manifesto.\u201d \n\nAs he spoke, he was greeted with both polite applause and standing ovations from his GOP brethren, even though many of his reforms seemed targeted at them. \n\nIn the front row was a lineup of former House speakers \u2014 Democrat Lee Moffitt, Republicans Tom Feeney, Larry Cretul and Will Weatherford. All but Weatherford have registered to lobby the Legislature before the six-year window Corcoran seeks. \n\nWhile Corcoran made no mention of his \u201cmanifesto,\u201d he explained that the changes must go beyond process and focus on broad reforms \u2014 in the education system, the justice system, and the judiciary. \n\nCorcoran stopped short of calling for universal education vouchers but called for lawmakers to \u201cfully fund the right of all parents to choose what school best meets their child\u2019s needs \u2014 regardless of whether it\u2019s public or private, religious or secular, or home school or virtual school.\u201d \n\nTaking aim at the Florida Supreme Court, which has ruled that offering every parent education vouchers violates the constitution, Corcoran called for 12-year term limits for all judges. \n\n He called for criminal justice \u201cmetrics\u201d that show which criminals are getting the harshest and longest sentences, and he called for safeguards \u201cto guarantee that justice in this state is never governed by the color of a person\u2019s skin or the size of their wallet.\u201d \n\nAnd Corcoran, who has spent his four years in office opposing Medicaid expansion and Obamacare, derided the \u201ctwo-tiered health care system\u201d and the state system that protects hospital profits at the expense of the poor. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time people realized that conservatives aren\u2019t against health care for poor people, we\u2019re against giving them poorly run government health care,\u201d he said, as his House members applauded but many Senate Republicans \u2014 notably Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando \u2014 remained seated. \n\nFinally, he called on his colleagues to \u201cserve a purpose greater than ourselves\u201d and \u201csacrifice our own interests\u201d telling the story of Jack Mashburn, a distant relative of his wife\u2019s, who in 1952 as a 22-year-old legislator changed the law that banned blacks from the beach only to be told by the racist leaders of his Panama City town that he\u2019d be voted out of office. \n\n\u201cEither you hear that story as a cautionary tale, or you hear it how I hear it \u2014 as a story of a person who put principle over politics,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026We can stand and fight, regardless of the cost, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the opposition.\u201d \n\n Both friends and rivals commended Corcoran for his call to action, but many also doubted he would succeed. \n\nRep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, who will be the House Democratic Leader in 2016. called Corcoran\u2019s ideas \u201ca very aggressive agenda.\u201d But she opposes putting term limits on judges and, having worked in a public defender\u2019s office, she has questions about whether it\u2019s a good idea to ban lawmakers from accepting jobs in government. \n\nAnd on the same week Corcoran was urging independence from the special interests, the political committee he runs to re-elect Republicans was hosting nearly a dozen fundraisers in Tallahassee to collect checks from special interests and lobbyists. \n\n\u201cI commend him for wanting to step outside the boundaries of Tallahassee and tackle the problem,\u201d said Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano, Corcoran\u2019s friend of 30 years who spent 19 years in the Legislature and attended the speech. \u201cBut you can\u2019t go up there and say we\u2019re going to overhaul the influence of special interests and then five minutes later take a check from those same special interests. If he wants to lead, he has not start with himself and he has to start now.\u201d \n\nCorcoran responded that he knows there will be cynics and doubters but he believes there are legislators who want to give it a try. \u201cIt\u2019s confront the brutal facts, and the brutal fact is ... man is flawed and if left to their own devices, they\u2019re going to try to seek their self-interest,\u2019\u2019 he said. \n\nMiami Herald staff writer Kristen M.
