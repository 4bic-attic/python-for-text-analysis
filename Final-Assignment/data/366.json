While it\u2019s been documented that eight people lost their lives this year due to sharks, ScienceAlert is reporting that more people worldwide \u2014 at least 12 \u2014 have passed away this year due to a selfie-related incident. In other words, selfies are killing more people than sharks. The latest death by selfie victim was a 66-year-old Japanese tourist who slipped down the steps at Taj Mahal\u2019s Royal Gate in India. Other selfie fatalities include the picture taker falling off a cliff, crashing their car, being run over by a train, or accidentally shooting themselves.\n\nSo what exactly is going on here? \u201cPart of what happens when a person gets focused and self-absorbed in something \u2014 whether it\u2019s their personal problems, a crisis at work or even taking a selfie \u2014 they become so immersed to the point where they get distracted and ignore almost everything else that\u2019s around them,\u201d says Stacy Kaiser, licensed psychotherapist. \u201cAnd in the case of selfies, people are dying because they\u2019re not seeing that cliff or noticing the car that is about to hit them.\u201d\n\nIn some situations, Kaiser believes that taking selfies, in its simplest form, can be viewed as fun and trendy. \u201cBut on a deeper level, there\u2019s a narcissistic element,\u201d she states. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018Look at me! Look how great I look! Look where I am! Everyone needs to see it and know about it!\u2019 It\u2019s attention seeking behavior. There has actually been re about the more narcissistic you are, the more selfies you take.\u201d\n\nAs for the selfie craze, Kaiser doesn\u2019t see it fading any time in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading and becoming even more part of what is considered socially acceptable.\u201d Just be careful out there.\n\n(SD-Agencies) Editor: Sylvia Xu", "source": "News Guangdong"}
