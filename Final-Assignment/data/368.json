Should they be injured in a fire fight or if someone tries to attack them, they\u2019ve got a safe haven in my home,\u201d Weis told News Center 7\u2019s Lauren Clark on Thursday.\n\nHe took to Facebook a week ago, offering to paint the symbol for anyone who expresses an interest in displaying it. The requests, he says, just keep coming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve received them from Troy, Tipp City, Vandalia \u2014 all the way down to Springboro and Moraine as well,\u201d Weis said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m really busy here in Huber Heights at the moment but I could see moving this on to other cities and municipalities.\n\nWeis is not asking for money.\n\nBut some people, like Ann Dew, are making donations just to keep the project going.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a house or a family unit that will support our law enforcement \u2014 it\u2019s basically just that,\u201d Dew said. \u201cWith everything else going on, you know, we just need to start showing our support.\u201d\n\nLeftover donations will be given to the Huber Heights Police Department to use as it wishes.", "source": "Dayton Daily News"}
