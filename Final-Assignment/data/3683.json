Over 35,000 classrooms were majorly or totally damaged, leaving more than a million children lacking access to a safe, permanent place to learn.1 In May and June 2015, Save the Children, Plan International, UNICEF and World Vision International consulted more than 1,800 children about their experiences and priorities in the aftermath of the earthquakes. \n \nEducation emerged as the second highest priority after shelter. Children said they wanted to return to school; but they also wanted to know that their schools were safe and able to withstand future earthquakes. \n \nChildren and families from vulnerable and marginalised groups continue to be disproportionately affected by the earthquakes and their aftermath. The resulting financial burden on these families will likely lead to children leaving the safety of school to support with income generating activities, as well as negative coping behaviours such as child marriage or child trafficking. Keeping vulnerable children in school is an important protection mechanism in this time of heightened risks.", "source": "ReliefWeb"}
