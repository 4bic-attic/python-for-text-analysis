Bento boxes provide not only the space for healthy and nutritious food choices, but also creativity. Isn\u2019t it time for lunch to be more fun? \nNutrition blogger and mom of two, Sally Kuzemchak, uses Lil Snappers kid-sized fruit when she creates bento box lunches because they are easy for little students to hold, serving size proportionate and each 3-pound pouch provides enough fruit for lunches and snacks for an entire week. On top of that, the fruit can be sliced up for dipping in almond butter or yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon or cut up into a fruit salad, perfect for the three or four compartments in a bento box. \n\nStudies indicate healthy eating can influence the cognitive ability and intelligence levels of students, and balanced midday meals of fruits, proteins, carbohydrates and healthy fats are best. For a well-rounded lunch, parents can fill bento boxes with fresh pasta alongside sliced carrots and grapes, taco fixings with a Lil Snappers apple or a fun and creative meal-on-a-stick to keep school-aged children satisfied throughout the day. \n\nPreparing healthy, filling lunches shouldn\u2019t be difficult, and with bento-box style meals your kids will never be bored. With a little preparation and recipe inspiration, crafting back to school lunches will be a breeze.
