Cannoli is a traditional Sicilian treat, which consists of a tube shaped shell stuffed with a sweet cream filling. While cannoli is a delicious dessert, it can be heavy and filling. \nThis recipe puts a lighter twist on the classic Italian dish by turning it into a sweet fruit dip. The recipe mimics the flavors of the dessert by combining ricotta cheese with powdered sugar, chopped pistachios and a few mini chocolate chips. The result is a light and airy dip that tastes like traditionally cannoli filling. The dip is a great addition to grilled fruit, which makes it the perfect dish for late-summer parties.
