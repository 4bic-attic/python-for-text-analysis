The judging panel consisted of cabling and communications system specifiers, designers, integrators and managers with vast professional experience. Leviton Network Solutions and eBay was recognized as a Gold honoree. \n\n\"On behalf of the Cabling Installation & Maintenance Innovator Awards, I would like to congratulate Leviton Network Solutions and eBay on their Gold\u2013level honoree status,\" said Cabling Installation & Maintenance Group Publisher Alan Bergstein. \"This competitive, unbiased program celebrates the most innovative projects in the structured cabling industry. We are pleased to celebrate Leviton Network Solutions and eBay's Gold status and recognize their contribution to the structured cabling industry.\"\n\nSponsored by: As part of its data center technology roadmap, eBay planned to upgrade to 40GbE to its servers. In order to meet the requirements of the new design, it needed a cabling solution that would support extremely long multimode fiber runs \u2014 up to 500 meters in length \u2014 and allow migration to future bandwidth speeds of 100GbE and 400GbE. \n\nThe company tested the Leviton OM4+ Premium Violet Data Center fiber system with extended reach 40GBASE-XSR4 transceivers. While these transceivers have a manufacturer's stated maximum distance of 400 meters, the channel tested successfully beyond that length, with zero errors or dropped packets when transmitting over 500 meters. The testing subsequently led eBay to install the OM4+ system in four of its data centers. The system uses all OM4+ cabling and connectivity, including Leviton Opt-X Unity trunks, harnesses, array cords, and cassettes. \n\nTo learn more about Leviton OM4+ violet fiber cabling, visit leviton.com/om4plus.\n\nAbout Cabling Installation & Maintenance \n\nPublished since 1993, Cabling Installation & Maintenance has provided practical information to professionals responsible for the specification, design, installation and management of structured cabling systems in enterprises, data centers and campuses.
