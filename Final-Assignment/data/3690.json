It argues for the removal of legal \u201c disincentives \u201d to IS fighters speaking. \n\nGovernments should provide defectors with \u201c opportunities to speak out; assist them in resettlement and ensure their safety; and remove legal disincentives that prevent them from going public, \u201d the report argues. \n\n[embedded content] \n\n\u201c It seems to me to be wrong that if someone is helping to deter people to join ISIS by casting a negative light on the group, that he is then being punished for it, \u201d Peter Neumann, ICSR director and author of the report told the Guardian newspaper. \n\n\u201c Right now, if you speak out, the prosecutor will say, \u2018oh that\u2019s very interesting, so he\u2019s admitting membership of ISIS, so we can prosecute him for that.\u2019 So that needs to stop, \u201d Neumann added. \n\nHe said that proper legislation was key to resolving the issue. \n\u201c We\u2019re not asking for the creation of legal incentives, saying \u2018if you tell a nice story you get an amnesty, \u2019 but people right now are being actively punished for speaking out and I think that needs to change. \n\n[embedded content] \n\n\u201c Lawyers need to figure out a solution for that so people are no longer disincentivised for that. \u201d \n\nWhile defections have been very small in number, the report approaches them as a key component of any effort to counter the jihadist group. It says cases of individuals fleeing \u201c have been sufficiently frequent to shatter ISIS\u2019s image as a united, cohesive and ideologically committed organization. \u201d", "source": "Russia Today"}
