Through the partnership, Uber is offering free rides (up to $20) to and from the airport to the airline's new or existing Elevate frequent flyer members with the purchase of any flight originating from DAL booked through October 12, 2015, while supplies last. Further, travelers who are new Uber users will also score an additional $20 ride* for a future ride.
