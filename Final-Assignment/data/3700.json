David de Gea was at his girlfriend's house in Madrid, [Real Madrid president] Florentino Perez was at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"Navas was there too and was waiting to pass a medical, and everything was signed and sent to Manchester.\n\n\"But the information is that the documentation didn't come back from Manchester United on time.\n\n\"Reports say the Navas paperwork came in at one minute past midnight in Spain and therefore did not reach La Liga on time, so the transfer is not going to happen.\n\n\"There is no precedent for this. Three years ago Fabio Coentrao could not go to Manchester United for the exact same reason, and Real asked the league if they could have five more minutes, and the league said 'no'.", "source": "Heart Radio"}
