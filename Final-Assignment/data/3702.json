Drivers took to the road for the first time Tuesday, even without the county's blessing. \n\nBoth companies received state approval Monday, but Clark County commissioners said Tuesday they would not be allowed to operate without county granted business licenses. \n\nBut hours after the meeting, Lyft and Uber were online.\n\nUber said it has more than 1,000 contracted drivers ready to go. They've been screened with vehicles inspected and many more are going through the process. \n\nNews 3 opened up the Uber app to find out how much it'll cost going from our station near downtown Las Vegas to The District in Henderson. It was a journey of more than 18 miles. The 25-minute trip cost $45.66, which included a $1 safety fee.\n\nUber drivers said the prices can vary depending on factors like traffic, but on the slightly faster trip back at 22 minutes, the total cost was $45.19, just a few cents cheaper.\n\nUber said drivers get 75 percent of the cut, and a big draw for those like Edgar Barbosa is that you are in charge of your work hours.\n\n\"With Uber, I don't miss any more birthdays. I make every anniversary now,\" said Barbosa. \n\nLyft is also online. One driver told News 3 he uses both Uber and Lyft for passengers. He said he first started using Uber on Tuesday afternoon. He said in four hours he did 12 rides. Then, he switched over to Lyft. \n\nWe took a ride from the station to the Stratosphere, which is a little over 3 miles. Including the trust and safety fee, it cost $13.80. So how about a taxi cab? We went the same distance and it cost $19.34, but when you add a $3 credit card fee and a 15 percent tip, the grand total was $26.01. That's a $12.21 difference.", "source": "My News 3"}
