Watt can't play defense for Texans by himself", "id": "6c119b5c-71a7-46f3-95ee-46b73cf9d069", "content": "J.J. Watt blew past Chiefs tackle Jah Reid, got his helmet flipped off, never slowed down, and sacked Alex Smith on a play that\u2019s going to get replayed the night he\u2019s inducted into the Hall of Fame, and long after. It was so incredible, it's\u00a0easy to forget it happened in a\u00a0Texans loss that was more lopsided than the 27-20 final score. It was also easy to forget\u00a0that a big chunk of the blame lands right on that vaunted defense Watt leads. MORE: Must-see Week 1 images | Chiefs vs. Texans puts fans to sleep | Watt doesn't need a helmet\u00a0 But to be fair, he was only supposed to lead it \u2014 not be it, all of it, one-against-11, working solo with a group of super-hyped, high-drafted, well-paid onlookers. Ideally, the MVP runner-up was supposed to be just the biggest part of a dominating whole. He wasn\u2019t. He was just J.J. Watt, one-man wrecking crew, getting almost no help from a supporting cast that included Jadeveon Clowney, Brian Cushing, Vince Wilfork, Jonathan Joseph\u00a0and their first two draft picks, Kevin Johnson and Bernardrick McKinney, among others. That can\u2019t last. Not for a Texans team that needs its defense to shoulder the load until, at the very least, Arian Foster gets back from his groin injury. Foster is pushing to return next week. Not only will the Texans embrace that, they may slip him into the secondary, or even the linebacker core. Heck, why not the defensive line, to give Watt some help? He wasn\u2019t getting it from his higher-profile teammates, old and new, young and experienced. The Texans offense didn\u2019t help. But few expected it to help. It doesn\u2019t have the players or the depth the defense does, not after the Texans got the gift of a healthy Clowney, and loaded up in the draft and in free agency. Brian Hoyer's turnovers\u00a0gave the Chiefs a short field for two of their touchdowns.\u00a0The Texans defense didn\u2019t have that excuse the rest of the first half, when they fell behind 27-6 and made Smith look like Joe Montana, from his Chiefs and 49ers days. The Houston crowd booed in the first half, for good reason. The offense was the primary target. That would be unfair, though. They needed the defense\u2019s help, and they didn\u2019t get it. Watt was as good as he always has been. He was in the middle of every play, but he couldn\u2019t rush Smith and plug the line against the run and cover Travis Kelce down the seams and Jeremy Maclin on the perimeter, all at the same time. He should never have been supposed to. The J.J. Watt Show, starring J.J. Watt, gets great ratings on YouTube and Twitter and during HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d and in commercials and among a nationwide fan base that wants heroes and loves his persona. It doesn\u2019t play well in a game, though. It\u2019s not what Bill O\u2019Brien and the staff and front office and the rest of the roster envisions. On Sunday, it was a certified flop.", "source": "Sporting News  Feed RSS"}
