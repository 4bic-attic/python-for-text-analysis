That was Maemu's sixth win against seven losses. \n\nPromoter Gilmey Masters announced Maemu's rematch with Siwisa at a press conference in Selby, Johannesburg yesterday. \n\nMasters said his 11-bout card would be bankrolled by Hunters Fitment Service Centre and Parts, which is owned by former middleweight and light heavyweight professional boxer Lionel Hunter. \n\n\"I have passion for this sport and it gives me great pleasure to be involved in any way possible,\" said Hunter. \n\nDuring the press conference Maemu said he has found his footing . \"Everyone who gets to face me must be above their natural potential because I always give 200% inside the ring .\" \n\nSiwisa missed the briefing.", "source": "Sowetan"}
