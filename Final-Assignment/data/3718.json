Such an attack would allow terrorists to capitalize on the increased media presence in the city and game a significant amount of attention while avoiding areas of high security.\u201d \n\nThe police document mirrors similar assessments by the FBI and U.S. intelligence that note the possible risk to papal security, but found no known threat against his visit. \n\n\u201cIt went back through every attempt on every pope\u2019s life, going back to the late \u201970s, not because we have specific information on the threat, but because we wanted to remind everybody on these details in all three cities about the way these things have happened in the past, the different ways they have been put together,\u201d the NYPD\u2019s head of counterterrorism, John Miller, told CBS on Tuesday. \n\nThe 15-page document lists groups that have expressed support for an attack on the pope. \n\nThese include ISIS, which has encouraged lone wolf attacks, al Qaeda and other groups, and the Italian mafia. The report also mentions right-wing groups upset at the pope\u2019s statements on economic inequality, environmentalism and homosexuality. \n\n\u201cSuch stances could draw the ire of right-wing groups within the United States that are displeased with the direction that Pope Francis is taking the Church,\u201d the NYPD report said. \n\nThe report also mentions threats from white supremacists who have used websites and other media to attack the pope as the antichrist. \n\n\u201cThough no threats were ascertained from these websites, a member of this community may seek to attack an individual that he or she believes to be evil,\u201d the NYPD report says.", "source": "KCMO Talk Radio"}
