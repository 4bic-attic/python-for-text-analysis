(\u201cBohemia\u201d is performed at Nordo\u2019s Culinarium, in Pioneer Square .) And given their previous piece, \u201cSeattle Vice,\u201d they have experience evoking bygone eras with music, humor and booze. \n \nBut \u201cSeattle Vice\u201d was set in the familiar era of the mid-1960s, amid Emerald City gangsters and crooked coppers. \u201cBohemia\u201d shuttles between different periods of the 19th century, between Paris and Prague, and between such notables as Polish composer Chopin, and Czech turn-of-the-century art nouveau artist Mucha. \n  Cabaret Review  \u2018Bohemia\u2019  \nBy Opal Peachey and Mark Siano. Through Sept. 27, at Nordo\u2019s Culinarium, 109 S. Main St., Seattle. Tickets are $25-$80, depending on whether cocktails and/or dinner are included; (800-838-3006 or brownpapertickets.com) \n    \nThe central persona in this diverting, atmospheric whimsy bubble is another famous Czech, Anton\u00edn Dvorak (Siano). \n Most Read Stories Marshawn Lynch's mom to Seahawks: Fire offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell Union suspends strike; school to start Thursday in Seattle Seattle police chief fires cop who arrested man carrying golf club So what happens now with Seahawks' Kam Chancellor? Boeing starts final assembly of its first 737 MAX Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. \nSmarting over a nasty review in a Prague newspaper for one of his compositions, and lacking inspiration for his ninth symphony, Dvorak goes on an absinthe binge. \n \nIn a hallucinatory haze he communes with the ghosts of artists past and present. The lusty sprites who\u2019ve been fetching your drinks are transformed into Dvorak\u2019s fairy posse. They dance, do supple acrobatics with emerald silk drapes, pose suggestively. \n \nSticklers for historical accuracy beware: the real Dvorak was a religiously pious family man, whose big indulgence was raising pigeons. And he wrote his best known work, Symphony No. 9 in E Minor (aka the New World Symphony) while living in the U.S. and (presumably) without any poetic mentoring from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (Peachey). \n \nAnd maybe the world-renowned actress Sarah Bernhardt (Cherry Manhattan) did perform a deliciously histrionic striptease for Mucha, as he painted her portrait. Somehow, I doubt it. \n \nSo take \u201cBohemia\u201d as both a freewheeling spoof of and ode to artistic romanticism. And on those grounds, it\u2019s a beguiling, mildly naughty and well-provisioned evening. \n \nThe cast is impressive, with all doing double (or triple) duty. Beside scripting, Siano and Peachey ably composed the music that isn\u2019t by Chopin, Dvorak and Debussy, including a robust drinking song (\u201cNazdravi\u201d). \n  \nFavorite number: the clever \u201cMy Girl George.\u201d In man\u2019s suit and top hat, Peachey\u2019s saucy Chopin duets with his cross-dressing (real-life) lover, novelist George Sand (Annastasia Workman). Then the fairies turn up in male garb to waltz along. \n \nPeachey and Siano are both proficient pianists and singers, and other instrumentalists pitch in. You marvel at the quick-change efficiency of the fluttering fairies. (Don\u2019t forget to tip them.) And some of the costumes, by Montana Tippett with others, are resplendent. \n \nIt\u2019s a lengthy show, with space for appetizers, drinks and goulash. And it could do with better jokes about Bohemia the place vs. bohemians, and rather less blather about art with a capitol \u201cA\u201d and inspiration with a capitol \u201cI.\u201d \n \nAs for the absinthe, do partake in the ritual if you can handle the ultra-intense taste of anise and the 136 proof kick. (You can also sip it in a less ferocious cocktail.) \n   \nAny production that has an absinthe consultant gets a badge for uniqueness. As the Czech toast goes, \u201cNa zdravi!\u201d", "source": "Seattle Times"}
