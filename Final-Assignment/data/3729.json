Bernt Wahl, who is on the faculty at UC Berkeley, was hoping for more from Apple following Wednesday\u2019s new product releases, with included a new iPad Pro and a new iPhone. \u2018I don\u2019t think they created anything that was really mind boggling today, not like the old days when Steve Jobs would have something tremendously insightful\u2019 said Wahl. He added that as Apple has gotten bigger, it\u2019s rate of innovation has slowed. \u2018They\u2019re not willing to take the risks that they were able to take earlier,\u2019 he said. \u2018Now they are resting on their laurels.\u2019 Wahl expects Apple will make incremental improvements, but other than the Apple Watch, he hasn\u2019t seen a new innovation come out in the last couple of years. \n Stocks in this video", "source": "TheStreet.com"}
