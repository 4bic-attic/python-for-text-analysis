Watch the hilarious video below! \n\nOne Direction wrapped up the American leg of their On The Road Again tour on Sept. 12, just in time to celebrate Niall Horan\u2018s 22nd birthday! Although the 1D blondie\u2019s birthday wasn\u2019t technically until Sept. 13, he took the opportunity to have 60,000 screaming Directioners join him in a rendition of Taylor Swift\u2018s \u201c22\u201d and it was completely adorable! \n\nNiall has never been the bragging type, but on the eve of his 22nd birthday, he couldn\u2019t resist sharing his excitement with fans in attendance at Gillette Stadium in\u00a0Foxborough, Mass. While he had the mic in between songs, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday in a couple of hours,\u201d as he happily bounced down the stage\u2019s catwalk. Guitar in hand, Niall busted into a quick cover of T-Swift\u2019s \u201c22\u201d! \n\nCAN I GET AN ACTUAL COVER OF NIALL SINGING 22 PLEASE pic.twitter.com/jvvcw21DwO \n\nEveryone in attendance sang along with Niall, which made\u00a0for quite the\u00a0perfect way for him\u00a0to celebrate with all of his fans. But ironically, even though Niall started the massive sing-along, he quickly admitted he didn\u2019t know the rest of the words about halfway through the chorus! Oh well, at least he got the most important message of the song across \u2014 he\u2019s feeling 22! \n\nLater in the show, the rest of the boys joined Niall to continue the bday fun and\u00a0serenade him with a very One Direction version of\u00a0\u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\u00a0Although 1D\u00a0will be taking a year-long hiatus starting in March 2016, they definitely proved that they are tighter than ever in their adorable birthday song huddle! \n\nAs sad as Directioners are for the boys\u2019 break, at the same show, Louis Tomlinson made a promise that they will be returning after taking a year off! This live announcement comes after Louis and Niall made the same guarantee on Twitter following the initial report of the break. Phew\u2026no wonder Niall and the boys were so happily singing birthday tunes! \n\nDid you love Niall\u2019s version of \u201c22,\u201d HollywoodLifers?
