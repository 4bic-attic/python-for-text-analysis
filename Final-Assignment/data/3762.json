Numerous orders and announcements issued by the ruling military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), imposed additional restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly. This has a resulted in a strict enforcement of a ban on public gatherings, events, and discussions that authorities claimed might affect national security. In addition, authorities have stepped up the intimidation of media workers, censorship, and the overzealous application of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws. \n \nOf particular concern is the growing number of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 arrests and prosecutions under Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. The deprivation of liberty and the imposition of disproportionately harsh prison sentences under the pretext of protecting the monarchy intensified significantly after the 22 May 2014 coup. On 22 May 2014, there were six people serving prison terms for offences under Article 112. As of 21 September 2015, that number had gone up to 35 and at least 14 more remained detained awaiting trial. \n \n \u201cOnly through a return to genuine democracy can the reform of present laws relating to l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, computer crimes, and public protest be achieved, so as to establish full rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and peaceful assembly. At this time, however, the most immediate demands on the NCPO should be to repeal Article 44 of the interim Constitution, rescind all orders restricting freedom of expression and assembly, end the use of military courts to try civilians, and cease all arbitrary detentions,\u201d  said iLaw Executive Director Jon Ungpakorn. \n \nIn a separate joint submission , FIDH and UCL document Thailand\u2019s failure to make real progress towards the abolition of the death penalty. \n \nSince Thailand\u2019s first UPR, there has been no effort to reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty. Instead of reducing the number of offenses that are defined as capital crimes, lawmakers introduced new legislation and proposed laws that expand the offenses that can be punished by death. \n \nDrug-related offenses continue to represent a disproportionate share of the crimes for which a death sentence is imposed. Thirty-seven percent of the men and 80% of the women who were under death sentences as of 31 May 2015 had been found guilty of drug-related offenses. \n \nThailand has repeatedly declared its intention to consider abolishing capital punishment. However, many of the official statements have made the abolition of the death penalty contingent on the support of public opinion. Regrettably, successive governments have failed to provide the general public with relevant information to have an informed opinion on the issues related to the death penalty. \n \n \u201cThailand has considered abolishing the death penalty and issued a plethora of statements to that effect. However, the lack of political will has stifled any meaningful action. Also missing is a government initiative to adequately inform and educate the general public on the issue,\u201d  said UCL Senior Advisor Danthong Breen.  \u201cDespite a steady decline in the number of prisoners under death sentence and no executions for more than six years, abolition remains an elusive goal,\u201d  he added. \n \nThe FIDH-UCL joint submission makes important recommendations to Thailand\u2019s government to take steps towards the abolition of the death penalty. \n \nPress contacts : \n \nMr.\u00a0Arthur Manet (French, English, Spanish) - Tel: +33672284294 (Paris)", "source": "Fidh"}
