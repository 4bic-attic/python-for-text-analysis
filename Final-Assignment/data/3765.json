Alberto Caber says two Japanese unsuccessfully tried to intervene before the gunmen escaped with their hostages aboard a motorized outrigger from Samal Island off Davao City. \n\nCaber says the gunmen appeared to have specifically targeted the victims when they entered the Holiday Oceanview Samal Resort late Monday on the northern tip of the island, about 975 kilometres southeast of Manila. \n\nHe says authorities have no immediate suspects. \n\nIn 2001, Abu Sayyaf militants tried to seize hostages from the Pearl Farm Beach Resort south of Oceanview during a ransom-kidnapping spree in the southern Philippines. \n \nContent Provided By Canadian Press.", "source": "Newstalk 1290 CJBK"}
