This surpasses the previous all-time high of 2.78% set in March 2000 \u2013 the top of the last largest stock market bubble in history . \n \nAnd despite the assurance of every mutual fund manager on TV that they have boatloads of cash ready to deploy at these \u201cdiscounted\u201d levels, in early August cash levels at mutual funds sank to their lowest level in history , 3.2% (see chart below). As a percentage of stock market capitalization, fund cash levels are also nearing the record low set in 2000 when the NASDAQ peaked and subsequently crashed by around 80% . \n  \nThe financial markets are absolutely primed for a major crash, and when that happens many among the elite will be hightailing it to the middle of nowhere. \n \nEarlier this year, the Mirror published an article all about this entitled \u201c Panicked super rich buying boltholes with private airstrips to escape if poor rise up \u201c. \u00a0 Here is a brief excerpt\u2026 \n \nRobert Johnson, president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told people at the World Economic Forum in Davos that many hedge fund managers were already planning their escapes. \n \nHe said: \u201cI know hedge fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway.\u201d \n  \nKeep in mind that these are not just some rumors that Robert Johnson has heard.\u00a0 These are people that he knows personally and that he interacts with regularly. \n \nAnd Robert Johnson was not alone in this assessment.\u00a0 Here is more\u00a0 from the Mirror \u2026 \n \nHis comments were backed up by Stewart Wallis, executive director of the New Economics Foundation, who when asked about the comments told CNBC Africa: \u201cGetaway cars, the airstrips in New Zealand and all that sort of thing, so basically a way to get off. \n \n\u201cIf they can get off, onto another planet, some of them would.\u201d \n  \nFor some reason, the global elite seem to have a particular affinity for New Zealand. \u00a0 Perhaps it is because of the great natural beauty of the nation combined with the fact that it is in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0 The following comes from\u00a0 the Daily Mail \u2026 \n \nNew Zealand , which is about the size of the UK, but has a population of just 4.4 million, offers them all the modern luxuries they have come to expect \u2013 but miles from any country which may implode into chaos . \n \nThe country is 11,658 miles away from the UK, while its closest neighbour is Fiji \u2013 1,612 miles away, more than double the distance between Lands End and John O\u2019Groats. \n \nHomes at the top end of the market come with tennis courts, swimming pools and media rooms \u2013 and some even boast their own personal jetties where a family can moor their boat. \n \nBut the icing on the cake for those looking to make a quick escape comes in the form of private helipads or, better, your own airstrip . \n  \nFor most of us, buying a luxury bolthole with a private airstrip in New Zealand is not a possibility. \n \nBut we should all be getting prepared. \n \nI have a contact in the food industry that has told me that her company\u2019s sales have \u201cbeen through the roof\u201d over the past 10 days as people stock up for what is coming.\u00a0 In fact, she even used the word \u201cpanic\u201d to describe what was happening. \n \nAnd Americans have been buying a record number of guns\u00a0 as well \u2026 \n \nNewly released August records show that the FBI posted 1.7 million background checks required of gun purchasers at federally licensed dealers, the highest number recorded in any August since gun checks began in 1998 . The numbers follow new monthly highs for June (1.5 million) and July (1.6 million), a period which spans a series of deadly gun attacks \u2014 from Charleston to Roanoke \u2014 and proposals for additional firearm legislation. \n  \nFor a very long time, I have been warning people to get prepared. \n \nWell, now we are getting so close that panic is starting to set in. \n \nHopefully you are already well prepared for what is about to happen.\u00a0 If not, you need to kick your prepping into overdrive . \n \nThese next few months are going to change everything.\u00a0 Get ready while you still can.", "source": "Zero Hedge"}
