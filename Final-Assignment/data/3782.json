I\u2019m the guest today over at Shimelle\u2019s blog ( direct link ) and I\u2019m sharing a brand new layout featuring her True Stories line and a full video tutorial. I was inspired by one of her past layouts and I had\u00a0 lot of fun translating it into something that works for me and my style. I hope you check out my post and enjoy! The timing of this is fantastic as I\u2019m currently at work on a design/sketch scrapbook course now\u2026 \n \nstay tuned!", "source": "Craft With May"}
