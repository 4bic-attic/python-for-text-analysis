Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Email to a Friend See comments On a recent afternoon in the small town of Traiskirchen, 20 kilometers south of Vienna, locals parked outside the gates of the former school and unloaded jackets and sneakers in all sizes, as well as thick coats, hats and gloves for the approaching winter to clothe those staying at the refugee camp. Magd Zaour, a 23-year-old former student from Damascus, Syria, said he was thankful for the outpouring of help. \u201cYou know, we throw our clothes in the sea, so we don't have clothes. We came here without clothes, without food, so people here are trying to help us,\u201d Zaour said. Locals, he added, were friendly and welcoming. But Magd has little hope in the Austrian government. For several weeks, he's been held in Traiskirchen, Austria's largest refugee camp, where he sleeps in a temporary tent. Instead of a mattress or a bed, he sleeps on one of two donated blankets. \u201cThe people here in Austria are so supportive ... but the government does nothing, I think,\u201d he said. That there are tents at all is, in a way, an achievement of Austrian governance. Built to house 1,800, the federally outsourced Traiskirchen facility is now a temporary home to 4,500. 'No longer tolerable'\nUntil several weeks ago, more than 1,000 people were sleeping on the open lawn, bracing through rain storms and heat-waves alike without any shelter, a situation criticized even by Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner, who was largely seen as responsible for the inadequate response. \"The situation in Traiskirchen is no longer tolerable for the asylum-seekers,\" Mikl-Leitner said. The United Nations and Amnesty International went a step further and describe conditions as \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201cdegrading.\u201d Images of people sleeping in the open shocked Austrians, said Dunja Gharwal, one of many volunteers independently helping refugees in Traiskirchen. \u201cAustria is a very rich country. We really sit here in abundance, and this is not necessary,\u201d she said, calling it her country's duty to welcome refugees. A professional social worker, Gharwal has organized a group of colleagues and translators to support refugees at the camp. Authorities, she said, were little prepared, and resources weren't scaled up in time to meet demand. Many refugees said they are receiving little to no information on their individual processing statuses and options. \u201cWe help them answer questions that come up, and those are actually quite simple questions, like 'what do my papers and documents mean?' 'Where can I get food? ... 'Where can I get clothes?'\" she said. \"Those are all questions that are recurring.\u201d Gharwal also noted that she and her colleagues are helping unattended children who are not supposed to be held at the camp due to their special needs and legal rights. 'Overwhelming'\nRight in front of the entrance to the Traiskirchen camp, Caritas, a relief organization that currently assists 17,000 refugees, has set up a staging area to hand out donations. Clothes, bags and shoes, as well as blankets for the cold autumn nights, are what's needed most. Close to 7,000 volunteers have signed up with Caritas to help in recent months, a number spokesperson Margit Draxl called \u201coverwhelming.\u201d \u201cThose aren't just people who've filled in on a weekend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's been going on for months, and without them, this help wouldn't be possible.\u201d From companies to celebrities, the private sector is helping fill the gap in aid. Some bosses, Draxl said, allowed volunteers to take paid leave if they wanted to help at camps. Big conglomerates, like retail group REWE International, are initiating vocational training programs for young refugees. Austrian singers and bands are organizing a free concert called \u201cVoices of Refugees\u201d in Vienna to collect donations for asylum seekers. As the number of new refugee arrivals increases, their location and personal needs change, so Caritas and other organizations are using social media to optimize the volunteer aid. \u201cCurrently needed: Cereal bars, nuts (please without shells), dried fruits, fruit puree snacks, and mineral water,\u201d read a Thursday's status updates on Caritas' Facebook page after it was announced that hundreds of refugees had arrived at the main train station of the province of Upper Austria. Dozens of volunteers answered, and food and drink responsibilities and distribution were organized quickly. But the need for proper accommodations for asylum seekers is pressing. Unexpected snowstorms have begun to hit more mountainous regions, and temperatures are expected to drop close to freezing in both cities and valleys. Austrian state broadcaster ORF recently set up a website aimed at linking Austrians with vacant apartments or houses with refugees and the organizations that assist them. \u201cThere's an almost unbelievable readiness to help,\u201d Draxl said.
