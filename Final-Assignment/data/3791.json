Nights out and drinking can often play a major part in student life and this coupled with the vibrant and busy social scene of Bedfordshire can lead to potentially dangerous situations. \n\n\"While we will be sharing advice around key crime areas such as burglary, rape and sexual assault and domestic abuse in young relationships at this prevalent time of year for young people \u2013 we would also be keen to remind them to take care, drink sensibly and look out for new friends as they celebrate their start to university life.\" \n\nThe University of Bedfordshire's Director for Student Experience Rumnique Gill said: \"Freshers is a great way to start university life, with plenty of opportunities to get involved and try out new things. But at all times we would urge our students to make safety a priority and to follow the advice issued by Bedfordshire Police. \n\n\"In addition, support and guidance is available on campus from the University's Student Support Team while the Students' Union run a Freshers' Angels scheme where returning students volunteer to help to settle in new students and provide a point of contact. To recognise a Freshers' Angel simply look out for students wearing blue t-shirts and feathered wings.\" \n\nBedfordshire Police and the University of Bedfordshire are proud to work in partnership and will be sharing messages throughout the Freshers' period. \n\nFor further advice visit http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk or to report a crime, call the police non-emergency number 101. \n\nAlternatively, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.  \n\nTo help ensure you remain safe as you begin a new term at university, take note of the following advice: \n\n- Try to avoid walking home alone at night. Wherever possible, use public transport and travel with friends. Never accept a lift from someone you don't know. \n\n- Don't walk along talking on your mobile phone. You may not be fully aware of what is going on around you. \n\n- When going out, only take with you the money you need for the night, and keep your wallet or purse somewhere safe. \n\n- Don't accept drinks from strangers and never leave your drink unattended. \n\n- Never share access codes with anyone who is not a resident of your house, flat or halls of residence. \n\n- Always lock doors and windows before you leave your halls or student house, and leave valuables well out of sight. \n\n- Remember that if someone is incapacitated due to drink or drugs, they are not capable of consenting to sexual activity. If you pursue it, you are committing a crime.
