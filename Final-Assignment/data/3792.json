Environmentalists quietly cheered the results, hopeful \u2014 though not certain \u2014 that the new premier would help steer Canada\u2019s most oil-rich province away from fossil fuels. \n \nNow, it looks like environmentalists can cheer a little louder. \n \nIn an interview with the Guardian , Notely previewed her forthcoming energy policy, which seeks to shut down Alberta\u2019s coal plants, clean up its oil industry, and make a robust switch over to wind and solar power. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are defined by energy. Certainly in the short to medium term that is an asset that we have, so we have to look at how we develop it carefully and responsibly because of the obligation we have to the people employed in the industry,\u201d Notley told the Guardian, adding, \u201cDo I see that as our reason for being 100 years from now? Well, I hope we will have learned a lesson of diversification by then.\u201d \n \nAlberta is Canada\u2019s largest oil-producing province, home to 78 percent of the country\u2019s oil production. And it has the natural resources necessary to produce even greater sums of oil \u2014 the northern part of Alberta sits atop a vast reservoir of heavy crude oil, potentially as much as 2 trillion recoverable barrels , the third-largest source of crude in the world behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. \n \nBut the mining of those tar sands has led to local environmental consequences, including deforestation and forest degradation. And the rampant increase in tar sands production \u2014 107 percent between 2005 and 2012 \u2014 has made Canada\u2019s energy sector its primary source of greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the transportation sector for the first time in the country\u2019s history. Because of the greenhouse-gas intensive nature of tar sands production, many scientists and environmental activists argue that expanding the mining of tar sands crude is incompatible with halting global climate change. \n \nNotley told the Guardian that fighting climate change while preserving the jobs created by tar sands production would be a delicate balancing act. \n \n\u201cI want to change the direction, bend the curve and do it as effectively as we can while maintaining jobs that are important to Alberta. People deserve to see government both at the federal and provincial levels that are committed to very significantly changing the rate of greenhouse gas emissions coming out of both Alberta and Canada,\u201d she said. \n \nAs the Guardian points out , that comment places Notley directly at odds with Canada\u2019s prime minister Stephen Harper, who has been a strong supporter of the tar sands industry since taking office in 2006. Under Harper\u2019s leadership, Canada has become one of the world\u2019s most notorious opponents to climate action, pulling the country out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2011 when it failed to meet its promised emissions cuts. Since then, Canada\u2019s emissions have only grown, and the country is expected to fail to meet its promised 2020 target \u2014 instead, it\u2019s projected that the country\u2019s emissions will increase 2 percent each year until 2020. This October marks Canada\u2019s 42nd federal election, however, so the country\u2019s environmental tide could turn if Harper isn\u2019t re-elected. \n \nSome scientists have argued that in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, the majority of Alberta\u2019s tar sands will need to stay in the ground , though Notley seemed more interested in regulating the oil industry\u2019s emissions rather than stopping them altogether. \n \n\u201cWe need to do much better with greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d she told the Guardian . \u201cWe need to take our environmental responsibilities seriously if we are going to have support for our products in other markets that have greater environmental concerns.\u201d \n \nEarlier this week, national New Democratic Party leader and Prime Minister candidate Tom Mulcair proposed a national cap-and-trade system to fight climate change. Notley expressed resistance to Mulcair\u2019s proposal, however, arguing that a cap-and-trade system would take funds away from Alberta. \n \n\u201cGenerally speaking cap and trade as one strategy is a bit problematic for us,\u201d Notely told the Guardian. \u201cIt would turn into a fairly major cash transfer from Alberta to other places \u2026 We are going to be more focused on a strategy that allows us to take investment that goes into reducing emissions and keeping it in Alberta.\u201d \n  Tags   Alberta Climate Change Tar Sands    \nThe post Leader Of Canada\u2019s Largest Oil-Producing Province Sees No Long-Term Future In Fossil Fuels appeared first on ThinkProgress .", "source": "ThinkProgress"}
