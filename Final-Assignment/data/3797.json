It was judged a rushed behind by the man upstairs. http://t.co/35dNSP2dnT\n\nThe 24-year-old echoed coach Alastair Clarkson in saying the Hawks' recent games at Domain Stadium in Perth would help them when they travelled to play Fremantle in WA next weekend.\n\nHawthorn lost to West Coast in Perth last week and beat them at the same ground in round 19.\n\nBreust said the ground was significantly narrower than the MCG so the experience playing in the different conditions would be valuable.", "source": "Melbourne Age"}
