The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star shared a series of photographs in honour of the milestone.\n\nShe wrote: \"45 million Instagram followers!!!!! I love you guys!!!!! ...\n\n\"Besitos everyone!!!!! #45mil ... Last selfie for the night. Thanks again for the instalove (sic)\"\n\nIt is not the first time the 34-year-old television personality stripped down for a selfie to celebrate her followers on the photo-sharing site.\n\nShe wrote at the time: \"27 mil!!!!! Thank you so much!!!! I love you all!!!!! (sic).\"\n\nAnd Kardashian West isn't shy of posting a revealing photo despite admitting she found it \"tough\" losing weight after giving birth to two-year-old daughter North.\n\nShe said: \"I couldn't help it, and everyone would say, 'She can't stop eating.' I delivered at 180, and they were like, 'She's 210 pounds. She's getting dumped because she's too fat' and all these ridiculous stories.\n\n\"It really took a toll after the fact, when I was losing weight. I gained 50 pounds, and it's tough to get it off. I was dedicated, but also, it changed the way I viewed wanting my picture taken.\"", "source": "Times Live South Africa"}
