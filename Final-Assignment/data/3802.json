I started out writing non-fiction, and had over eighty travel and geographic articles appear in magazine and other publications. As exciting as that was to see my work in print, my passion for exotic world travel, outrageous adventures, stories of survival, and happily-ever-after endings soon drew me into a world of romantic suspense. When not writing, I enjoy gardening, traveling, putting together jigsaw puzzles, listening to live music, college sports, and spending time with family.\nTell us about your latest book.\nA Dose of Danger is a romantic suspense novel and the first in a developing series. When researcher Grace Talbot and her team discover a possible solution for weight loss they become targets of a group dedicated to controlling the multi-billion dollar a year diet-product industry. From the lab in Salt Lake City, Utah to the family ranch in Wyoming, danger closes in on Grace as she struggles to deal with tragedy in the wake of a fire, and the task of keeping all the animals alive throughout a harsher than normal winter. As the investigation progresses and the stakes get higher, she becomes more dependent on the local sheriff\u2019s deputy. With her colleagues either dead, missing, or on the run she soon realizes that she must trust him with her life, but can she trust him with her heart?\nWow! That sounds suspenseful. What inspired you to write this particular book?\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve begun paying more attention to what I eat and my overall health. The more I read about nutrition and fitness the more confused I become, especially when it comes to supplements. There are a myriad of products out there that make all sorts of claims, but what\u2019s true? I\u2019m sure the answer is very complex because there are a lot of variables that influence a products effectiveness, which makes the subject an excellent topic for fiction. With so many options, it\u2019s difficult to know which companies and claims to trust.\nWhat do you love about this book? And what do you hope readers will tell others about it?\nI love stories of survival against the odds, and this book has plenty of that. Most of my stories have heroes or heroines who push their physical and emotional capabilities to the breaking point in order to prevail. I always hope I have that much fortitude if I find myself in a bad situation.\u00a0 I hope readers will tell others that it is a well written book full of action, suspense, drama, and realistic romance. I hope they find it exciting and entertaining, and worthy of recommending to friends and family.\nWhere do you get ideas for your books?\nI get my ideas from a host of different places. A lot of inspiration comes from my travels. I used to spend a lot of time in Mexico, which is where Marked In Mexico and Deadly Ruins came from. Big Horn Storm has a number of ties to my upbringing around horses, Deadly Exodus was inspired by a remnant of a dream I remembered one morning, and Shrouded In Secrets was spawned from watching a show on various mysteries, and one delved into the legends surrounding a group of crystal skulls. My latest novel, A Dose of Danger, may be a manifestation of my mild conspiracy theory paranoia and suspicions of market manipulation on nearly every front, especially when it comes to the health and diet product industry.\u00a0 What themes do you write about? Survival\u2014as mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve always loved stories about testing one\u2019s physical and emotional strength, and surviving against formidable odds. I also enjoy exploring true and lasting love developed through shared tragedy or adventure. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the lust first, love later model.\nWhat are you working on right now?\nI just finished with a second novel in the series which begins with A Dose of Danger. The deadly market manipulation continues as the corrupt coalition wields its lethal influence in the manufacturing of those healthy frozen meals that fill the freezer section of every grocery store.\nWhat is the coolest, wackiest, most risk-taking thing you\u2019ve ever done?\nOne of my riskiest adventures came from following a small group of cows over a steep embankment during a cattle drive I was on with my dad as a teenager. We were taking the cattle to a high grazing lease for the summer. By the time we reached the steepest, last big push, the cows were getting tired and a few decided it would be easier to slide back down the mountain than to keep climbing. My dad was on a green-broke colt which wasn\u2019t as surefooted as my palomino gelding, and getting a little tired herself with her heavier load. To make a long story short, my dad told me to go after them. I looked at him like he was mad, but nudged my horse, assuming he wouldn\u2019t go if he thought it was too steep. He was a good cow horse, so he didn\u2019t hesitate to plunge over the edge after the cattle. The slope was too steep and the dirt too loose to stop and I ended up beating the cows to the bottom. As calmly as possible with one\u2019s life flashing before her eyes, I gathered the cows up and herded them back to the dirt road where my dad was waiting to help me guide the cows up the hill to the rest of the herd. I still occasionally have those, \u201cMan From Snowy River,\u201d flashbacks, but the experience did help me write a couple scenes in Big Horn Storm. My dad clearly had a lot more faith in the horse and my ability than I did, and thankfully he was right.\nThat sounds exciting! What is the most embarrassing thing that\u2019s happened to you?\nThe list is lengthy, but probably one of the funniest was the time I went shopping with my husband to a fairly large town about 45 miles away. While he was washing the truck I looked down and noticed I had my slippers on. We had gone too far to turn around, so I proudly wore them while running errands, shopping, and eating out for the rest of the day.\nIntroduce us to the main character in your new book.\u00a0\nGrace Talbot is a researcher for a company that develops nutritional supplements for humans and animals. She primarily works on supplements for animals, but stumbles on a product that if it can be modified for human consumption, has the ability to make a few people very rich and end the need for dieting. Grace was raised by her uncle at his ranch in Wyoming after being abandoned by her parents as a child, so she\u2019s had to work through her share of issues to get where she is today. She has a successful career and is a loving niece to her lone family member.\u00a0 Learn More about Kim and A Dose of Danger at Kim's Web site\nKim's blog\nTwitter\nAbout\u00a0A Dose of Danger When researcher Grace Talbot and her team discover a possible solution for weight loss they are targeted by a group dedicated to controlling the multi-billion dollar a year diet-product industry.

How are you feeling today?\u201d Grace could only hear one side of the conversation, but it was enough to know Moss wasn\u2019t the only one who cared about her fate.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll keep her safe, I promise. Yes, I\u2019ve noticed she can be a bit stubborn, but she knows when to cooperate and hasn\u2019t given me too much trouble. No, I can\u2019t give you any details. The less you know the better. We\u2019ll leave as soon as the sheriff calls back with a location.\u00a0 You have what? Where? If we need it, thanks. If we don\u2019t I never heard those words. Yes, I noticed the trailer lights aren\u2019t working, and the clutch on your truck sticks a bit. I may be from Arizona, but I do know how to pull a horse trailer and operate a truck in four-wheel-drive. We better not tie up the line too long, but we\u2019ll call as soon as we get to wherever we\u2019re going. What? Yes, I\u2019d be happy to do that for you. Take care.\u201d\nBy the time Logan hung up, the tears were gone. Hearing Moss treating the big, strong deputy like a child made her smile. She missed her uncle so much it hurt. Even in a hospital bed hundreds of miles away, he was still trying to take care of her. \u201cWhat would you be happy to do for Uncle Moss?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis,\u201d he replied as he pulled her into his arms and kissed her. His lips moved slowly over hers until he felt her arms slide up around his neck. He deepened the kiss, and her response sent fire through his body. Even without his heavy coat on, he knew he would be burning just as hot. She fit against him like they were made for each other. When he finally let her go, she looked up at him with a wicked smile that made him itch to grab for her again. As if sensing his intention, Grace took several steps back. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain that wasn\u2019t what Moss asked you to do for him.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMaybe he said something about giving you a hug for him, but I started tuning him out when he decided I needed driving instructions. Anyway, I didn\u2019t want to disappoint an injured old man, so I winged it.\u201d\u00a0 Grace studied him for a moment. Maybe he won\u2019t walk out on me, but even if he does, I might as well make the most of every moment we have together. She smiled and moved within reach. Logan needed no further encouragement. He pulled her toward him. With one arm firmly around her waist, he ran his fingers through her hair. \u201cYes, those curls are just as soft as they look,\u201d he moaned as his lips descended to hers, cutting off any response.", "source": "Peering Through Life's Window"}
