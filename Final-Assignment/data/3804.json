Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports \n\nQuarterback Drew Brees believes the New Orleans Saints are an improved team heading into the 2015 season. The question is, after losing multiple players, including tight end Jimmy Graham and wide receiver Kenny Stills, what's his reasoning behind it? \n\nWell, according to Mike Triplett of ESPN, Brees thinks it simply has to do with having better people in the organization. \n\n\"Better people,\" Brees told ESPN. \"Better guys. Guys that care about one another, guys that trust one another, guys that care about the process.\" \n\nThat's an interesting statement, but it's one that the Saints as an organization seem to be focused on. They went through a \"no nonsense\" type of offseason it seemed with a few players. Apparently now, it seems that the changes have left the locker room in New Orleans as a closer group. \n\n(h/t ESPN)", "source": "LocalNews7.com"}
