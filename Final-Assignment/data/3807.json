The child\u2019s death is tragic, but the media\u2019s cynical exploitation of the image is grotesque. \n \nWhile the media hand-wring and wail about the poor migrants overwhelming Europe, it is a crisis, but not the crisis that the media would have you believe it is. The international media obscure the reality of this flood of \u201crefugees\u201d into Europe, in an attempt to blunt legitimate concern over it. \n \nHere\u2019s a typical headline: \u201c Hungary police force migrants from train tracks; dead boy\u2019s image shocks Europe .\u201d \n \nCNN says of the photo of the toddler: \u201cIt took a tragic photo of a drowned toddler on a Turkish beach to make the refugee torrent pouring into Europe a problem for America too.\u201d \n \nThe mother and two boys died \u2013 the father lived. The boy died because his father wanted new teeth. That speaks volumes . \n \nAlso, the father\u2019s story is riddled with inconsistencies that show him to be thoroughly dishonest. In a deeply damning report on his numerous self-contradictory stories, the Muslim Issue surveys his various statements and then adds this devastating conclusion: \n \nAlthough Abdullah claims to have seen the dead bodies of his two children and his wife after their boat was hit by two large waves, his story then changes and he claims that he made it safely to the beach. He now assumed that the wife, who had laid bloated and drowned, and the two small boys who he had seen drowned right in front of him and he knew were dead, had managed somehow to make it alive to the beach. He could not find them on the beach so he assumed they had \u201cbecome scared and ran away.\u201d He now sees these dead people nowhere. But he only finds the \u201ctruth\u201d about their death after going to the hospital where their bodies were kept. Can someone explain to us how dead bodies run away? In other words, he only knew they were dead after the pictures of his son started showing up in the media reports. \n \nThe victims of the Christian, Yazidi and religious minority genocide in Islamic wars are no less valuable or important as the Muslim child on the beach. They are all victims of the global jihad. \n \nWhere are the photos of the little girls gang-raped and bought and sold in ISIS slave markets to fighters and\u00a0wealthy Muslims? Why don\u2019t their deaths spur the West to decisive action against the jihadic doctrine and its adherents? And how many jihadis are among the refugees? \n \nThe father whose wife and children drowned is a tragedy \u2013 a casualty of war, a war being brought to the continent of Europe by this massive invasion. \n \nPamela Geller\u2019s commitment to freedom from jihad and Shariah shines forth in her books \u2013 featured at the WND Superstore \n \nThat image is not iconic of the invasion, but the media say it is. Take, for example, this caption on another photo: \u201cBUDAPEST: Hundreds of migrants stormed Budapest\u2019s main international rail station after police reopened it on Thursday (Sep 3), in an escalating refugee crisis seared into European hearts by horrifying pictures of a drowned Syrian toddler.\u201d \n \nThis is just emotional manipulation of the vilest kind, as we\u2019ve already seen so many times with the Gaza conflict, the Bosnian civil war, the supposed \u201cgenocide\u201d of Muslims in Burma, etc. \n \nIn 732, the Battle of Tours ended the \u201clast of the great Islamic invasions of Europe.\u201d How this new invasion will end is anyone\u2019s guess \u2013 but it won\u2019t be pretty. Today\u2019s refugee is tomorrow\u2019s jihadist: Already jihadis have been discovered among the refugees , and there will be more of that. \n \nIn February, the Islamic State threatened to send half-a-million Muslim migrants to Europe in a \u201cpsychological\u201d attack against the West. And lest we forget, back in May, I reported that the Islamic State was making a fortune smuggling Muslim \u201cmigrants\u201d into Europe. \n \nImmigration jihad, or hijrah, is the migration or journey of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Yathrib, later renamed by him to Medina, in the year 622 CE. It was after the hijrah that Muhammad for the first time became not just a preacher of religious ideas, but a political and military leader. That was what occasioned his new \u201crevelations\u201d exhorting his followers to commit violence against unbelievers. Significantly, the Islamic calendar counts the hijrah, not Muhammad\u2019s birth or the occasion of his first \u201crevelation,\u201d as the beginning of Islam, implying that Islam is not fully itself without a political and military component. \n \nThe EU is telling its members that they must take in these migrants or lose important grants. Yet meanwhile, the oil-rich Muslim countries, chiefly Saudi Arabia, are doing nothing for the refugees . Muslim countries are not taking a single refugee . No, non-Muslim Europe must absorb them all, so as to be all the more easily conquered and Islamized. \n \nThe fact is, the mass Muslim migration is symptomatic \u2013 it\u2019s not the problem. ISIS is the problem. Iran fueling and fighting Assad\u2019s civil war is the problem. All of this chaos has resulted from Obama\u2019s disastrous and incoherent foreign policy. \n \nYet the media\u2019s callous and cynical spin is that those who voice legitimate concerns and oppose the refugee influx into Europe are just like the Nazis . That hyperventilation was in the Washington Post. The U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail was even worse, likening the trains carrying refugees to settlement camps to the Nazi trains that carried Jews to their deaths: \u201cYou did not need to be a historian to sense the chilling echo of Europe\u2019s not-too-distant past. The last time people were duped on to trains around here, they ended up in Auschwitz.\u201d \n \nThe crisis is crushing \u2013 the scale of which is one not seen in Europe since the end of World War II. Obama\u2019s \u201cjunior varsity\u201d team has overturned the order of the world. And it\u2019s only just begun. \n \nMedia wishing to interview Pamela Geller, please contact media@wnd.com . \n \n           Receive Pamela Geller commentaries in your email  BONUS: By signing up for Pamela Geller alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.
