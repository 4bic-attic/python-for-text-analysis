We said at half-time to go out and bring a lot of energy and bring the momentum of that goal with us. \n\n\u201cWe got the early goal in the second half and took it from there. We never looked like conceding after that. The defence was great and everyone put in a shift. \n\n\u201cCity were top of the league at the start of play and we showed what we\u2019re capable of. We\u2019ve got a young team, a very energetic team and we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re enjoying every moment and days like this will give us even more confidence.\u201d \n\nAnd Kane also hopes that his goal will help to silence some of the critics who had began to question whether the striker would be able to live up to his exploits of last season \u2013 when he scored 31 goals in all competitions. \n\n\u201cMaybe I shut up a few people who have been talking over the past few weeks,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly seven games have gone and a few people called me a one-season wonder. People can judge me at the end of the season and we will go from there. \n\n\u201cI have to stay focused but it was great to score. When you score like I did last season it becomes a drug and when someone takes it away from you then you want to get it back. You want to score again and it was a good feeling to score again. \n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to be criticised. I kind of use it to get my juices flowing and to prove these people wrong. I have had to prove people wrong throughout my career to get where I am.\u201d", "source": "Hendon Today"}
