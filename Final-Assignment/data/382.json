This has to change if doctors are to diagnose more people with cancer earlier, when treatment is more effective.\" \n \nLatest NHS figures show that half of NHS trusts in England fail to meet the target for 85% of cancer patients to start treatment within 62 days of being urgently referred by a GP. \n \nAround 6,100 patients in the first quarter of 2015/16 were not seen within 62 days. \n \nThe NHS is also only just meeting its target for 93% of patients with suspected cancer to be seen by a specialist within two weeks of referral by their GP (93.6% are seen). \n \nThe Government's cancer strategy, published this summer, said that by 2020, 95% of patients referred for testing by a GP should be definitively diagnosed with cancer, or have cancer ruled out, within four weeks of referral. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nDr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: \"Well-resourced testing services are crucial to the early diagnosis of cancer, which in turn is vital to increase survival from the disease. \n \n\"The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances that it can be cured.\"", "source": "Wiltshire Times"}
