One hand was holding the knife and the other was kind of covering his face. Like he had his head in his hands. But he was wearing sunglasses the whole time.\u2019\u2019 \n\nDespite some reports, shot Australia Post worker Steve Hodge had not been sacked before he lunged at police with knife @newcastleherald \n\u2014 Dan Proudman (@Proudman74) September 9, 2015 \nThe witness said \u00a0police arrived within four minutes, and fired three shots at the man when he refused to put down the knife. \n\n\u2018\u2018Two police officers rocked up and got out, they were holding their guns up and yelling at him to put the knife down but he still wouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 she said. \n\n\u2018\u2018Then he came at the police with the knife.
