I knew she was isolated.  Her and Bridget were twins, you know?\" \n\nFerguson, who remains at United as a director, had planned to retire in 2002 but his wife convinced him to carry on. She did not try to persuade him to do the same in 2013, however. \n\nFerguson added: \"But when I told her this time I was going to retire she had no objection whatsoever. I knew she wanted me to do it.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Kenilworth Weekly News"}
