Watch this surprising video first\u2026 \n      \nPlanning your wedding is exciting, right? \n \nAnd choosing your nearest and dearest to be in your wedding party is one of the best parts. \n\nBut, while you may think you\u2019re bestowing a great honour upon them, the truth is\u2026 well, it\u2019s very different. \n\nAnd this video, created by the clever folk at Buzzed, has revealed EXACTLY why that is, \n\n\"I'm not crying because the wedding is beautiful,\" explains one bridesmaid to the camera. \"I'm crying because I spent \u00a31,000 to be in it.\" \n\nIt only gets worse (or better, depending on your P.O.V.) from there. \n\nCheck it out: \n \n[embedded content] \n \nOh dear. \n\nWell, it\u2019s obviously not ALWAYS like this for bridesmaids - but, when the bride is being particularly bridezilla-isn, we imagine that they will start snapping the hen party for \u201cpotential blackmail\u201d. \n\nThe lesson to take away from this is NOT to forget having bridesmaids completely.
