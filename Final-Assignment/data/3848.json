But, because Obasanjo was the second in command, he took the capital to Abeokuta. I don\u2019t condemn his action, I am only saying our people should learn from that.\u201d \n \nWhile lauding Governor Amosun for ongoing construction projects in the state, the leader of Muslims Ummah in Ogun state, dismissed allegations in some quarters that the governor is concentrating more on Abeokuta in terms of development, adding that state capitals around the world enjoy certain rights and privileges that befit their status. \n \n\u201cWe have bridges in Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ilaro. The governor is touching everywhere. Abeokuta is the state capital just like Abuja or Lagos and therefore should be treated as a state capital.\u201d \n \nHe then charged the newly installed Muslims\u2019 Women leader, Princess Adebisi Edionsere to continue her support for propagation of Islam through dedication and philanthropic activities. \n \nSource: Business Day", "source": "NewsNG.com"}
