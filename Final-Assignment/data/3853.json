You can cure it. How though? \n\nLooking back at how awesome your relationship used to be is\nnice for reminiscing but like what you have now as well. Appreciate what you\nhave now as well. \u00a0Maybe the both of you\nhave gone slack and are not as spontaneous as you used to be. The thing is\nstart realizing that when you were out looking for someone and eventually\nsettling into a relationship with your partner that they were what you wanted.\nYou were hoping for them to say yes to you and they were your dream date. We\nget into a rut when we stop appreciating our partners and thinking that someone\nelse who is better, who will treat us better is still out there for us. \n\nAs relationships progress we rarely is ever feel the need to\nplease our partners at all. In the beginning we would be more open to do things\nwith them and find out what their latest interests are. Now if they ask you\nanything you are more inclined to say no rather than say yes until they stop\nasking completely. Soon enough, you have no idea what your partner is up to and\nwhat they are doing. If your partner asks you to join them, try being open to\nsaying yes and restrain from an outright now. For a change, cancel something in\norder for you to be with them. \n\n\u00a0", "source": "News24"}
