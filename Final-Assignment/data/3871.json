The Indians\u2019 senior running back made the most of his opportunity. \n   \nRushing for 168 yards and two touchdowns, Dunne helped Lemont (4-1, 2-0) to a 41-12 victory over previously undefeated South Suburban Blue foe Tinley Park. \n\n\u201cThat was a good way to celebrate my 18th birthday,\u201d said Dunne, who played defense a year ago. \u201cAll the credit goes to the offensive line. They really stepped up this week. \n\n\u201cWe had a lot of setbacks this week, but we had to keep our heads up. We just kept going, kept going.\u201d \n\nDunne scored on a 70-yard run with 2:39 left in the first half, which upped Lemont\u2019s lead to 20-6. He added a 21-yard score late in the fourth quarter on a cutback to the right. He also kicked three extra points. \n\n\u201cOn the first run, I just saw the hole and thought, \u2018don\u2019t slow down, just keep running\u2019,\u201d Dunne said. \u201cOn the second one, after the bounce-out, I saw the home and ran as fast as I could.\u201d \n\nDunne was far from the only offensive star. Quarterback Spencer Nagle threw three touchdown passes in the first 24 minutes, all to Jeremy Fejedelem. Two were screens that the senior wideout turned into 46- and 19-yard touchdowns. \n\nNagle added a sneak for a touchdown and another passing TD in the second half. \n\n\u201cThe line did an awesome job and he [Nagle] threw the ball well,\u201d Lemont coach Bret Kooi said. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of held the reins back because he is young. We needed to cut him loose a little bit this week and without a doubt, he stepped up.\u201d \n\nNot to be outdone, the Indians\u2019 defense had another strong showing against a Titans\u2019 offense that had scored 125 points over the past two weeks. Brendan Cunningham had two interceptions and Fejedelem a pick and a sack. \n\n\u201cTheir offense is good,\u201d Kooi said. \u201cBetween their quarterback, running backs and wide receivers, they are really explosive.\u201d \n\nThe win capped a tough opening five-week stretch for Lemont. \n\n\u201cThrough this five-game stretch, we thought to have success we had to stay healthy,\u201d Kooi said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t stay healthy. It\u2019s a compliment to them. The kids that stepped in, stepped up. And it\u2019s a compliment to our staff.\u201d \nComments", "source": "The Herald News"}
