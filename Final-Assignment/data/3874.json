The witnesses, and some members of congress, also stated the air force should speed up the procurement and beat the current 2030 full operational capability date. \n\nThe quantity and schedule concerns come as the air force prepares to award a bomber development contract to either Northrop Grumman or a Boeing-Lockheed Martin team. It also comes one week after the air force stated that the competing bomber designs are more technologically mature and deliverable than previously disclosed. \n\n\n\nNorthrop Grumman \n\nAs of this month, the air force has 158 bombers (63 B-1s, 20 B-2s and 76 B-52) which average 39 years of age, and only 96 are currently funded for combat service. Gunzinger says today\u2019s 20-aircraft B-2 fleet can muster just 12 combat sorties on any given day, and without a sizable order of new bombers, American won\u2019t be able to overcome the air defences of sophisticated adversaries. \n\n\u201cIf we don't buy the LRS-B, well, then the B-2 eventually will not be able to penetrate into China, into Iran, and some other areas. The B-1s and the B-52s already can't penetrate into those higher threat areas,\u201d he explained. \n\nDuring the briefing, several lawmakers including Paul Cook and Steve Knight, who both represent aerospace hubs in California, expressed tentative support for the next-generation bomber programme, so long as it doesn\u2019t overrun initial cost estimates was the case with the Lockheed Martin F-22, F-35 and Northrop B-2 projects. \n\n\u201cI will support this, as long as we keep the price down and it accomplishes the mission,\u201d says Knight, who also questioned whether it would be wiser to pursue three overlapping bomber procurement programmes than just one example designed with a 50-year operating life. He says \"flying the wings off\" a single type makes the US force less flexible to emerging threats.", "source": "Flight International"}
