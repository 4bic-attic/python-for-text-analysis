This is a dry heat much more manageable than Nepal's humidity.\n\nGetting off the plane I was a bit breathless with a bit of buzzing in my ears - that's the altitude. Others felt their heart racing. A couple of puffs on my inhaler sorted me out.\n\nAs you can imagine passport control was a typically, well organised Chinese affair. But I did get talking to a very nice, official young man. He explained that today is a day of celebration - the first day of autumn and they celebrate with moon cakes. He disappeared and came back with a moon cake gift and a greeting written in Tibetan. I'm not sure what it says, but I hope our guide will translate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe altitude takes a bit of getting used to. Tonight we have had a great Chinese meal. I'm in our room conserving my energy.... but Tony has gone off with the lads to explore and he has the wallet!!!!\n\nTomorrow we're off on the bikes heading to base camp.", "source": "fionak18's Blog"}
