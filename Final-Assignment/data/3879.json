Her husband, Luke, is played by former \u201cChuck\u201d star Zachary Levi, who is 6-foot-3. \n\n\u201cI needed a whole lot of man and I got it,\u201d she jokes. \n  \nBut don\u2019t think that the Collinses are \u201cHeroes,\u201d the ordinary people of the show\u2019s title who have developed superpowers of one sort or another.

Already paranoid about the Evos\u2019 existence, the world turns against them. \n\nBut the Collinses have even more of a reason to hate Evos than most people. The couple lost a son in the attack and are out for revenge. Taking up arms, they are on a mission to track down those they believe are responsible. \n  \n\u201cThey say there are seven stages of grief and Joanne got stuck on anger,\u201d says Shekoni about her character. \u201cShe\u2019s wonderful to play, willing to go toe-to-toe with anybody.\u201d \n\nThe actress, who began her career as a model and split time between London and Los Angeles, says she thinks of Joanne and Luke as a mixture of \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d and \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith,\u201d two movies she likes very much. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very imposing looking,\u201d she notes, referring to her and Levi, \u201cespecially with all our weapons.\u201d \n\nThe fact that Joanne is \u201cnot really a heels kind of girl\u201d is a nice change of pace, Shekoni observes. \n  \n\u201cAs a woman, you often have to worry about your hair, makeup and outfits,\u201d she says. \u201cWith this it was, \u2018Can I act with a gun, and can I move fast?\u2019\u201d \nWhere to watch... \nWhat: A 13-episode event series that reboots the original hit, 2006\u2019s \u201cHeroes.\u201d \n\nWhen: Two-hour premiere 8 p.m. Thursday. \n\nWhere: NBC.", "source": "Whittier Daily News"}
