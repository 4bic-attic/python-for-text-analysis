We all know about it but we\u2019re not allowed to talk about it\u201d. \n \nHe told Piers Morgan on Life Stories: \u201cI did my bit, I said what I had to (but they didn\u2019t air that). I found myself banned from BBC radio for quite a while, for my contentious behaviour. They wouldn\u2019t state this directly, there\u2019d be other excuses.\u201d \n (ITV) \nFormed in 1975, the Sex Pistols went on to become one of the most well-known and notorious British bands of all time. \n \nPundits credit them with inspiring the punk rock movement, and charismatic frontman Lydon became known for his raucous behaviour. \n \n\u201cWe became so big so quick that it was too earth shattering to really deal with sensibly. We had no prospects of fame and all of that and I think that shows. That\u2019s why the quality of the Sex Pistols is still there,\u201d he said. \n (Mathew McCarthy/AP) \nHis former band mate, Steve Jones, gave him his \u201cJohnny Rotten\u201d moniker, after commenting on the state of his teeth. \n   Promoted stories   \nLydon said: \u201cBad teeth. In my childhood, the only time I saw a toothbrush used was my dad cleaning boots. There was bits missing (in my teeth), all cracked up, I\u2019d avoid the dentist.\u201d \n \nThe band broke up in 1978, and Lydon went on to launch a solo career. \n \nThese days life is infinitely quieter for the former wild child, and he is married to Nora Foster, who he says is the \u201cbest person in the world I\u2019ve ever known\u201d. \n (ITV) \nApart from their anarchic public image and behaviour, the band also had to deal with the death of former member Sid Vicious, who died after being released on bail for the murder of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. \n \nVicious\u2019s death from a heroin overdose in 1979 was a fate that Lydon said was \u201cinevitable\u201d. \n \n\u201cSid was my mate and all that, but I watched him slowly destroy himself. I\u2019ve got to be honest \u2013 it came as no surprise,\u201d he told Morgan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly catastrophic, he killed himself \u2013 as most people who mess about with heroin, they lose their souls way earlier, it\u2019s just waiting for the body to keel over.\u201d \n   \n Share article  \n   \nPiers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories: John Lydon airs on ITV at 9pm Friday September 25.", "source": "Borehamwood Times"}
