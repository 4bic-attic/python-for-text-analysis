The differences are very slight, especially against a strong team like Juventus. Maybe Juventus didn't create so many chances but they had a strong finish. \n\n\"I don't think this result is just because of Raheem. We controlled the game and didn't have many problems but football is like that. \n\n\"I don't think we deserved to lose. We played better than Juventus and we had three clear opportunities to score. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"Buffon made some very good saves but I think we were very unlucky. We never want to lose here at home, we never want to lose important points, but we have 15 points more to play for.\" \n\nJuve boss Massimiliano Allegri was more gushing in his praise for Buffon after a superb display from his veteran captain. \n\nThe 37-year-old's double save from Sterling and Silva soon after City had taken a controversial lead - with Chiellini claiming he had been impeded by Vincent Kompany - was particularly impressive and a key moment. \n\nAllegri said: \"Buffon pulled off many miraculous saves, particularly just after we went 1-0 down. Buffon is an extraordinary goalkeeper, perhaps the best ever in the history of football. He never fails.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nAnother critical moment came after 75 minutes, with the score at 1-1, as City skipper Kompany was forced off with a calf injury. \n\nHis replacement Nicolas Otamendi, making his City debut, was caught out and Morata curled in a brilliant winner. \n\nCity will now wait on updates on Kompany's condition ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with West Ham. \n\nCity missed Sergio Aguero up front with their star striker limited to just six minutes off the bench due to a knee injury. \n\nPellegrini said: \"It was a risk to use him. I tried not to because if he got a kick in the same part it could take him more days to recover. Fortunately he did not have any problems and I hope he will be fit for Saturday.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Rye and Battle Observer"}
