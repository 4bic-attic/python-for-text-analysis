Uchumi currently has 26 branches in Kenya.\n\nKenya Power has been signing on main retailers including mobile service provider firms, among them Safaricom and Airtel to tap into the huge traffic of shoppers who frequent supermarkets, mostly in urban areas.\n\nIn May Kenya Power said it would be spending Sh500 million to set up a premium customer care lounge at its Nairobi headquarters targeting corporate clients who contribute to the bulk of its revenue. \n\nThe move is aimed at attracting new members to the new premium club where beneficiaries have access to specialised lines to call in case of a power blackout or emergency.\n\nEmpty shelves\n\nUchumi Supermarkets\u2019 management is striving to rebrand the retailer and regain credibility from shoppers who were frustrated by empty shelves and poor customer service. \n\nThe retailer says its shelves are now about 80 per cent stocked and is seeking to win back more suppliers who had severed links due to non-payment for deliveries.\n\nThe retailer has already hired a new team among them Julius Kipng\u2019etich as its new chief executive and Willy Kimani as the chief operations officer.\n\nUchumi has also started renovating its hypermarkets in Nairobi, with the exercise expected to end in November. It also plans to close down non-performing branches once the evaluation of all its branches across the region is complete.", "source": "Business Daily Africa"}
