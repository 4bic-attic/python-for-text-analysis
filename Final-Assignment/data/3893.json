Workers employed by stevedoring company Portus lifted each boat from the river before loading them one at a time onto the Thorco Shipping general cargo vessel Thorco Copenhagen. The crew boats are being sent to Maracaibo, Venezuela where they will be used to transport oil refinery employees to and from offshore oil rigs. \n \nSt. Johns Ship Building is a full service ship building and marine repair company specializing in both new construction and repair of a wide variety of commercial vessels.
