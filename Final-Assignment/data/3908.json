He kneels down and lures the three dogs on the premises to the fence,\u00a0 Brakpan Herald \u00a0reported. \n \nClick here to watch the video. \n \nShortly afterwards, he grabs the puppy named Angel, pulls him through the fence and places the puppy in the bag before casually walking away. \n \nWhen the the dog owner, Teresa Ajudia, checked the footage, she was horrified to see how the suspect stole their puppy. She then took to social media in an effort to trace the man. \n \nShe reportedly received a call from a person who gave her a tip-off on who to phone. After she had tried many times, someone apparently answered on the other end and told her where to go. \n \nOn Sunday morning, Teresa arrived at the address with a security company and saw the man who had taken Angel from her yard. \n \nShe confronted him and managed to grab Angel. \n \nA woman at the house brought a collar to Ajudia and asked her if it was her dog\u2019s collar. \n \n\u201cI looked at the collar and immediately recognised it,\u201d Ajudia said. \n \n\u201cShe then showed me to a room and opened the door just a little bit. I couldn\u2019t see clearly what was going on inside that room, but Angel wasn\u2019t the only dog there. After I called his name and hoped he would respond, I felt his soft fur against my hand and immediately took him from that dark room. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there or what they\u2019re doing to these dogs, but they all seemed like family pets that didn\u2019t belong there,\u201d she added. \n \nTeresa took Angel to a veterinarian, who said Angel had picked up cat flu and is going through a lot of stress at the moment. \n \nThis incident was reported at the Brakpan Police Station. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on brakpanherald.co.za", "source": "Roodepoort Record"}
