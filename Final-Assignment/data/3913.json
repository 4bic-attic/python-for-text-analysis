If the Pope follows the word of God because God said \u201c Ye shall not judge others as ye shall be judged on judgment day\u201d\u00a0 If the Pope shows no hard feelings about the life that those people are leading,\u00a0 I think quite a few people will be disappointed. I believe especially president Obama will be disappointed, as it will be like a slap in the face for him if he did that on purpose to get a reaction from the Pope. That\u2019s my little rant of the day.", "source": "Bob J's Rants"}
