Recently, I called 911 for two different situations. In both, the 911 operator asked me to hand the phone to one of our staff members. When I asked why, she said, \u201cI want to ask about you and confirm what happened.\u201d \n\nNow, if she needed to clarify location or situation, I can understand that. However, in both situations it was clear (by staff answers) they were asking if it really happened. To waste time having to look for someone (an authority figure) to verify my story could easily take five minutes or more to find one. \n\nThat is a lot of time to waste in an emergency. A fire can quadruple in size in that time. A person can bleed to death from an arterial wound in that time period. Why? Because a 911 operator wasted it to question the caller\u2019s honesty, instead of sending the proper responders to the scene. \n\nI know people call in false reports a lot, but that is no reason to question every caller\u2019s honesty. Even in places like this. Yes, I know many people in facilities like ours have a mental illness or other brain disorders. But so do a lot people outside these places. However, that doesn\u2019t mean they are less honest than a normal person. \n\nHow do you expect people to call 911 in a real emergency if their honesty will automatically be in question? All you are doing is discouraging people from calling 911 when they really need it. \n\nGeorge Stanton Baughman \n\nStar \n\nP.S. \n\nI absolutely love, love, love Jordan Willis. She\u2019s smart, witty, thoughtful, thought-provoking, sweet and soo cute!", "source": "Courier Tribune"}
