But when my sister and all our friends were casting spells so they could enroll in Hogwarts, I was wondering what was so interesting about a bunch of kids with wands. \n        \nI couldn\u2019t broadcast my disinterest in this series without being ridiculed so I went with my friends to watch the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies, but even then they bored me to tears. My love for Percy Jackson gave me a small taste of being a book fangirl, but it was false hope because then the \"Twilight\" fandom came along and all I cared about was Taylor Lautner playing a cute werewolf in the movie. \n \nWhen I couldn\u2019t even get through the first five chapters of \u201cDivergent,\u201d I began to wonder: What was wrong with me? \n \nThis summer, I was determined to find a YA beach read that was such a page turner it would keep me up late at night. At the top of my list was \u201cMe and Earl and the Dying Girl.\u201d The book got off to a good start: It was original, funny and clever. \n \nBut as I read on, the narrator\u2019s indifferent disposition and shallowness irritated me so much that I had to pinch myself to get through the rest of the book. \n \nNext on my list was the master of YA novels, John Green. I started \u201cAn Abundance of Katherines\u201d with an open mind, but after the first few chapters, the main character seemed so full of himself that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to read another page. \n \nSince this isn\u2019t considered one of Green\u2019s best books, I decided to pick up one of the most beloved books of our generation: \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201d I watched the movie again, so I\u2019d be motivated enough to read the whole thing through \u2014 since I\u2019d given up on this novel three times before. But yet again, I had to drag myself to the end of it. I\u2019m probably the only girl in America who didn\u2019t totally love this book! \n \nIt was then I realized I\u2019ve never liked young adult fiction, and I most likely never will. While other kids\u2019 heroes were Hazel Grace or Harry Potter, mine were characters like Atticus Finch from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s strange, but I even find classics like Dickens\u2019 \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d to be more engrossing than John Green. \n \nThis summer, I ended up reading \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d even though I\u2019ll be studying it in English class this school year. The beautifully crafted sentences make it obvious why many call it \u201cthe great American novel.\u201d I enjoyed other books like \u201cThe House on Mango Street,\u201d \u201cThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter\u201d and Salinger\u2019s \u201cNine Stories.\u201d \n \nFellow reality panelists and PHS classmates, don\u2019t hate me, but I\u2019m actually excited to go back to reading adult fiction for school.", "source": "The Intelligencer"}
