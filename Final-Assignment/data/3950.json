This policy change first came into effect on December 12, 2011 and was initially enshrined in Citizenship and Immigration Canada\u2019s [CIC\u2019s] Operational Bulletin 359. The policy change was shortly thereafter incorporated into section 6.5 of CIC\u2019s policy manual, CP 15:Guide to Citizenship Ceremonies.\n[2] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One of the reasons given by the Federal Court for its judgment was the determination that this policy change was mandatory. The Federal Court also found that the policy change conflicted with the requirements of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 and with the regulations made under that Act.\n[3] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The appellant has conceded that if we do not interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s finding as to the mandatory nature of the policy change, this appeal must be dismissed in part because paragraph 27(1)(h) of the Citizenship Act delegates authority to make regulations regarding the taking of the oath of citizenship to the Governor in Council and this policy change was not adopted by the Governor in Council.\n[4] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While we do not necessarily agree with all the reasons given by the Federal Court, we see no basis to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s finding as to the mandatory nature of the impugned change in policy as this finding is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.\n[5] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We decline to address the issues concerning the legality of the impugned policy change under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a determination on this point is unnecessary for the disposition of this case and the record before us is fairly scant as concerns the Charter challenge. Moreover, we believe that it is in the interests of justice that we not delay in issuing our decision through the examination of an unnecessary issue so as to hopefully leave open the possibility for the respondent to obtain citizenship in time to vote in the upcoming federal election.\n[6] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a result, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\n\u201cMary J.L.
