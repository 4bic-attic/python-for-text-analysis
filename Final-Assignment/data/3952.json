The Australian talks to John Stern about adjusting to life in the other corner.\u00a0 \n\n\n \nJos Buttler is sitting on a bench behind the Lord\u2019s pavilion. While England\u2019s wicketkeeper conducts an interview, Trevor Bayliss, who has been in the job only a matter of weeks, ambles past, a bag slung over his right shoulder, signature sunhat on head. As the England coach looks over, Buttler nonchalantly raises a hand and nods: \u201cTrev.\u201d \n \nTrev? Having recently been engrossed in the high-school American football drama series Friday Night Lights , your correspondent had to resist the temptation to say: \u201cThat\u2019s Coach Bayliss to you, son.\u201d\u00a0But meeting Bayliss at the Oval two days before the final Ashes Test, it\u2019s easy to see how Buttler and his teammates would have so quickly developed a rapport of such comfortable familiarity with their new boss. \nYou might also like  \nHe seems like the guy you\u2019d sit next to at a wedding, chat to all evening and then on the way home forget what he said he did for a living. Understated doesn\u2019t even cover it. He repeatedly declined his players\u2019 exhortations to join them on the field for the on-field celebrations after the end of the Ashes. \n \nEven within the peculiar, and still evolving, parameters of the international cricket coach, he is unusual. He\u2019s the anti-ego and the jargon-buster \u2013 the conductor of the orchestra rather than the composer of the music. \n \nHe came with a reputation for media aversion and it remains to be seen how the inevitable setbacks and the pressures of the job \u2013 remember, he left his family in Australia \u2013 change his public persona, as it did some of his predecessors. But for now, Trev\u2019s happy to chat. \n \n*** \n \nWhat were your initial impressions of what you were taking on when you first arrived?\u00a0 \n \nTo be quite honest, it was a little bit of an unknown. It was only just before the New Zealand series when I agreed to do the job. I probably wouldn\u2019t normally even have watched the New Zealand series but I thought I\u2019d better actually start watching these blokes play! So I watched on the TV at home in Australia. Eoin Morgan was really the only guy in either the Test or one-day side that I knew from being together at Kolkata in the IPL. That made it exciting \u2013 it was a new start, if you like, with a lot of new, younger players coming into the team. \n \nRight from the way England played against New Zealand through to the Ashes success, everything has seemed so unexpected. What was your own expectation a few months back?\u00a0 \n \nWell, yeah, a couple of months ago I would have had the same view as every Australian \u2013 that if the Australians play well they\u2019d be very difficult to beat in England. They obviously haven\u2019t played as well and we\u2019ve played very well but we\u2019ve been a part of the reason why they haven\u2019t played well. \n \nSo, you arrive at Heathrow, Andrew Strauss picks you up and then you met Alastair Cook for the first time the next day?\u00a0 \n \nActually I happened to run into him at Lord\u2019s that first day I was here. I was due to meet him the next day before we got on the plane to Spain. But he happened to be in there so I had a quick half an hour or so with him. He\u2019s a very easy guy to get on with, lovely bloke. \n  Bayliss and his assistant Paul Farbrace have struck up a good rapport with Alastair Cook  \nIs Cook a different man to the one you bumped into at Lord\u2019s the day you arrived in England back in June?\u00a0 \n \nNo, not really. He\u2019s a lovely guy and very easy to talk to. With Alastair what you see is what you get. The only difference between then and now is confidence. He\u2019s got a team that\u2019s playing well and that makes it easier to captain in a positive way. He\u2019s taken on board his role as captain. He had a role to play in [making] the team play a more attacking or positive brand of cricket, so I think he made some changes there. \n \nSome of the players have spoken about the importance of that trip to Spain \u2013 how did it come about?\u00a0 \n \nAndrew Strauss asked me what I thought about a camp before the Ashes for the players to get to know me. I obviously thought it was a good idea. He had a couple of options, somewhere here in England or Spain, to just get completely away from any distractions I suppose. It\u2019s funny \u2013 we copped a bit of criticism at the start but now everyone thinks it was a great thing to do! \n \nAnd the slip fielding you worked on \u2013 was it about sheer volume or was there something specific?\u00a0 \n \nNo, I think the volume was probably the main thing. We did chat about a couple of things, like the spacing between the slips and also trying to watch the ball a bit longer. I think it\u2019s impossible to watch the ball all the way in because it\u2019s moving too quickly but if you can watch it for as long as possible and maybe a bit longer than what they were, that helps. \n \nYour reputation as a player was as a very good fielder. Did that come naturally?\u00a0 \n \nI played in a New South Wales team with a lot of international stars and it was difficult to stand out as a batter in that group. The one area I could compete on an even keel was in the field, so I tried to field as well as I possibly could and be the best fielder out there. I fielded mostly in the covers so there was a fair bit of running around but thankfully I don\u2019t have to do quite as much these days! Fielding is the one area of the game where everyone is in it together and I think the way the team fields is a sign of the team\u2019s attitude. If you\u2019re fielding well that carries over into your batting and bowling. \n \nGiven that England\u2019s new-found attacking attitude was clearly evident during the New Zealand series before you arrived, how did that change in mindset originate?\u00a0 \n \nI think the players and the hierarchy here in England probably realised that the best teams in the world were playing a more attacking style and we were getting left behind to a certain degree. Farby [Paul Farbrace] and I spent a fair bit of time together before but you can\u2019t play in a particular way unless the players actually want to do it. That was my only bit of advice to the guys here before I came was that it\u2019s got a lot to do with\u00a0selection: if you put the players in who will play that way naturally, then it\u2019s going to happen naturally. It\u2019s not a case of setting out to hit fours and sixes. It\u2019s about having a positive mindset in defence as well. If you have that positive mindset, your feet move well, and if your feet move well, that gives you the opportunity to hit those bad balls for four or six. \n \nHas it been at all weird coaching an Ashes-winning team against your own country?\u00a0 \n \nFrom a professional point of view, it\u2019s been fantastic. I\u2019ve got to say, the work done before I got here has gone a long way towards these players winning the Ashes. From a personal point of view, I know a lot of the Aussie boys and I know they\u2019d be hurting. But some of the toughest battles I had at home growing up were against your mates, and you walk away after that with respect for your opposition. I\u2019ve had some good support from some of those guys when I first got the job. \n \nHow much did your inside knowledge of some of Australia\u2019s players contribute to winning the Ashes?\u00a0 \n \nSome of our experienced players have played a lot against this Australian team so I don\u2019t think there was anything that was terribly unknown about those players. Maybe it was more in their [Australia\u2019s] mind or the Australian public\u2019s mind that that was going to happen. But I think it\u2019s more about the English boys being very confident of their roles in the team. \n  Bayliss compares notes with England football coach Roy Hodgson  \nHow are you settling into life in England?\u00a0 \n \nAustralia and England are very similar so that has made it easy to fit in. The players themselves are a good bunch of guys and good fun to be around. The management and hierarchy have been fantastic. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been involved with a successful team that hasn\u2019t had good, strong organisation behind it. Tom Harrison, Andrew Strauss and Colin Graves have to take a lot of credit. \n \nHad you spent much time in England before?\u00a0 \n \nNo, not a lot. Only at the 2009 T20 World Cup with Sri Lanka. But I did play some league cricket up at the West\u00a0of Scotland Cricket Club in Glasgow in \u201989 and \u201990 \u2013 only missed three games in two seasons! They were two hot summers. \n \nWhy did you get into coaching?\u00a0 \n \nCricket was the only thing I\u2019ve ever been trained to do. I was interested even when I was 16 and 17 when I coached the under 10 team in the country town where I grew up. Then towards the end of my playing career, there was an opportunity to join New South Wales cricket, first as a development officer going round schools. Then after a couple of seasons the coaching team expanded and I became the New South Wales under 19 coach and that\u2019s where it took off. I had four or five years there, four or five years as assistant coach to Steve Rixon for New South Wales and then took over from him. \n \nWhere do your coaching inspirations come from?\u00a0 \n \nI think anyone\u2019s coaching style comes from the players you\u2019ve played with and the coaches you\u2019ve played underneath. I\u2019ve been really lucky to have played with a number of good players like Mark Taylor, the Waughs, Greg Matthews, Geoff Lawson, Michael Slater, Michael Bevan\u2026 all those guys. From a coaching point of view, Bob Simpson was the coach of the state team when I first got in in the mid-80s, then Steve Rixon. All those people have played a part in the way I go about things. \n \nAre you into reading books or philosophies of other coaches?\u00a0 \n \nNo, I\u2019m not really a big book reader. I\u2019ve said to the guys that I think the best coaches are the other 10 players in the team. If you watch how other players go about things, how they\u2019re playing particular shots, how they\u2019re bowling, how they prepare for the match\u2026 if you\u2019re watching those things and asking the right questions, talking to those people, you\u2019ll learn more about the game and more about your own game from that than you will from any coaching. \n \nWhat are you looking to improve on over the coming months?\u00a0 \n \nWhile the success has been fantastic, we don\u2019t want it to paper over the cracks. There are a few areas we have to work on and I\u2019d like to see us find a bit more depth in spin bowling and batting as well. [Pace] bowling seems to have the biggest depth at the moment. \n \nHow important is it to have different personnel for different formats of the game?\u00a0 \n \nIt\u2019s probably only the best players who can play all formats but there\u2019s no reason why guys can\u2019t develop their game and step from one to the other. But as I\u2019ve said to our guys a few times, the best players are good at all three forms and I think the absolute basics of batting don\u2019t change from one format to the other. The best players have got a good solid base, good balance, a still head and fairly level eyes \u2013 that gives everyone the best chance to hit the ball in the middle of the bat whatever format you play. \n \nBut the schedule surely mitigates against players appearing in every game in every format?\u00a0 \n \nYeah, I think there\u2019s a certain amount of burnout. I think you\u2019ll find in most countries now that a lot of players will have a break somewhere along the line. I think it\u2019s just as important to be mentally fresh \u2013 probably more important \u2013 as to be physically fresh. \n \nFollow @JStern_Cricket", "source": "All Out Cricket"}
