Simpson has been a Stampeder for eight seasons and won Grey Cups with the team in 2008 and 2014. \n\nCalgary added defensive backs Brandon McDonald and Keith Lewis to the roster and placed cornerback Joe Burnett on the six-game injured list Monday. \n\nBurnett suffered an ankle injury on a punt return during Friday's 25-23 win over the Blue Bombers in Winnipeg. He was filling in for injured Tim Brown on return duties. \n\nMcDonald was added to the active roster, while Lewis was placed on Calgary's practice roster. \n\nMcDonald had 33 tackles, two interceptions and three knockdowns in eight games this season for the Ottawa Redblacks before his release Aug. 26.
