Irish Whiskey, one of the world's fastest growing Irish whiskeys, today announces its plans to engage Rugby fans nationwide with an integrated communications and events campaign to run during Rugby World Cup 2015 ( September 18 th to October 31 st ). The U.S. activations mark the first time that Tullamore D.E.W. has been part of an internationally televised sporting event and are connected to a larger global undertaking by William Grant & Sons as the Official Spirits & Champagne Tournament Provider of Rugby World Cup 2015. \n\nAs part of the U.S. campaign, fans over 21 can participate in The Tullamore D.E.W. Game Face Yourself Sweepstakes through a custom face paint website, where fans can customize a photo of themselves to display team pride and enter for the chance to win a once in a lifetime opportunity to attend Rugby World Cup 2015 Final ( www.GameFaceYourself.com ). Tullamore D.E.W. will also help fans root for their team of choice through several events in true Irish spirit: among friends, sharing a drink. Overall, the partnership with Rugby World Cup 2015 will explore the strong camaraderie and social traditions at the heart of the sport, which offer a natural moment to enjoy the triple blend, triple-distilled smooth character of Tullamore D.E.W. \n   \nOn key Tournament match days, Tullamore D.E.W. will host large-scale pop-up fan zones in Denver ( Sept. 27 th ) and New York ( Oct. 7 th ). Hundreds of rugby fans will have the opportunity to watch the matches and sample whiskey in Tullamore D.E.W.'s custom Daniel E. Williams Snug, an immersive brand experience that mimics the classic cozy Irish snug commonly found in pubs, where loyal patrons enjoy their whiskey in semi-privacy. Through these fan zones and several watch parties at bars across the nation, Tullamore D.E.W. has selected the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) ( www.challengedathletes.org ) as their beneficiary to raise money in support of their grant program, which assists athletes with physical challenges by providing adaptive sports equipment that gives them the same freedom to enjoy sports as everyone else. \n\nCindy Wang , Senior Brand Manager, Tullamore D.E.W., comments: \"Tullamore D.E.W. is excited to align with Rugby World Cup 2015 to celebrate a highly social sport that strengthens bonds and draws people in \u2013 values that are at the heart of our brand. We're looking forward to engaging thousands of rugby fans with Tullamore D.E.W. through one of the world's greatest sporting events.\" \n\nOn target to be the biggest and most viewed Rugby World Cup to date, engaging new and existing audiences, this showcase event is set to deliver an unparalleled platform to project the sport and its unifying values \u2013 integrity, solidarity, and passion \u2013 which are a perfect complement to Tullamore D.E.W.'s dedication to the celebration of true character. \n\nWorld Rugby Chief Executive Brett Gosper said: \"We are delighted that Tullamore D.E.W. will represent Rugby World Cup 2015 on behalf of William Grant & Sons in the U.S., a country that has seen rapid growth in the popularity of rugby. We are pleased to partner with a brand with likeminded values and dedication to showcasing the spirit of the sport during its most important competition.\" \n\nAbout Tullamore D.E.W. \nTullamore D.E.W. is the second largest Irish whiskey in the world in the fastest growing category. It has been widely acclaimed by whiskey connoisseurs, most recently winning a Gold Medal at the 2014 International Spirits Challenge for Tullamore D.E.W. Original. Additionally Tullamore D.E.W. 10 Year Single Malt won the Chairman's Trophy (highest award) for best Single Malt Irish Whiskey at the 2013 Ultimate Spirits Competition and Tullamore D.E.W. 12 Year Old Special Reserve won the Double Gold Medal at the 2013 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. \n\nWith an intriguing smooth yet complex character, Tullamore D.E.W. is triple distilled, but is also a unique blend of all three types of Irish whiskeys; the pot still, malt and grain whiskeys. As a result, Tullamore D.E.W. is three times smoother with an added gentle complexity. Tullamore D.E.W. was the first and remains one of the few international Irish whiskey to pioneer this blend of three. \n\nCreated in 1829, the brand's strong heritage started in Tullamore, a town in the heart of Ireland , and was fostered by the vision of an early founder Daniel E. Williams , whose initials live on the bottle to this day. True to its heritage, a new distillery is now being built in the town of Tullamore to bringing Tullamore D.E.W. back to its roots. \n\nTullamore D.E.W. is best enjoyed to taste, but we recommend neat, on the rocks or served long with ginger beer, fresh lime juice and a dash of bitters in a Tullamore Irish Mule. \n\nAbout Rugby World Cup 2015 \nRugby World Cup is the financial engine behind unprecedented investment and growth in rugby worldwide.
