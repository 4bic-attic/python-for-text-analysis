About 650 people signed the guestbook last year at the site, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. \n\nRogness said she didn\u2019t have 2015 attendance figures for the weeks before the state took over or for the first week of September, but she was pleased with the jump in visitors, which she attributed to extensive media coverage. \n\n\u201cIt was in the news a lot,\u201d she said. \n\nState lawmakers appropriated $100,000 in 2013 to buy the site, requiring that certain repairs be made first. The State Historical Board decided in a contentious 6-5 vote in January 2014 to buy the property, which had been on the market for about 2\u00bd years. \n\nThe site made news again last spring when lawmakers debated whether to provide operating funds, ultimately voting in April to provide $100,000 for the 2015-17 biennium. Still, purchase negotiations between the state and Welk\u2019s family dragged on into June. \n\nEdna Schwab, one of Welk\u2019s two nieces who gave tours of the site for 25 years before the state took over, said she didn\u2019t want to criticize the state but has heard complaints and witnessed firsthand during a visit last month that the site\u2019s focus has shifted away from the history of her uncle, who died in 1992 at age 89. \n\n\u201cNow, when they come, it\u2019s not what it was,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think to some people it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d \n\nRogness said the state has expanded the site\u2019s storyline for visitors, highlighting not only Welk but also the history of Germans from Russia who settled the area and pioneer farming and homesteading. \n\nThe state took input this summer during the Tri-County Tourism Alliance\u2019s monthly meetings in Ashley, Napoleon and Strasberg, and during a Germans from Russia international conference in Bismarck in July, on what locals want to see in the site, Rogness said. \n\n\u201cI have enough ideas to keep me busy for the next 10 years,\u201d she said. \n\nIn addition to the house built in 1899, the site features asummer kitchen, outhouse, blacksmith shop, granary and a barn moved onto the property in about 1949. Welk left the farm at age 21 to pursue a music career, rising to host \u201cThe Lawrence Welk Show\u201d on ABC from 1955 until 1971. \n\nAdmission is $5 for adults; $3 for children 6-15; those 5 and under get in free. \n\nVisitors are \u201cmostly adults 60-ish or older\u201d but include some young families, as well, said Rogness, who ran the site with the help of a couple volunteer and paid staffers. \n\nOne tourist last week was a woman from Florida who was working close to the North Dakota-South Dakota state line, and earlier this summer a man from Boston attending a legislative conference in Bismarck made the 75-mile trek to the site, Rogness said. \n\n\u201cAnd he was pretty taken, because he said this is so different from Boston,\u201d she said. \n\nRogness said she would like to see annual attendance top 1,000 people, but she thinks it will take five to seven years for that to happen, with the help of additional programming and cross-promotion. She hopes to have two to three state employees working there next year. \n\nSchwab suggested employees be required to read Welk\u2019s autobiography, \u201cWunnerful, Wunnerful!\u201d and said he\u2019s hoping for the best. \n\n\u201cI hope that it\u2019s kept up to the point where people get something out of it when they do come,\u201d she said.", "source": "Grand Forks Herald"}
