Dave Most. \n\nWhen first responders arrived, the pilot, identified as Paul Borghese, 47, of Ashburn, Virginia, was already out of the plane, Most said. The pilot was not injured and refused treatment at the scene. Nobody else was on board. \n\nThe pilot told troopers on the scene that he began experiencing engine troubles and was told to try to make it to the airport in Gaithersburg. When the pilot realized he wouldn't make it, he said he was instructed to do a forced landing in the corn field, according to Most. Most said the corn stalks where the plane landed are between 10 and 12 feet high. \n\nOfficers were still trying to determine where the pilot took off from and where he was headed. \n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration have both been notified and an FAA investigator is en route, Most said. \n\nHe said the plane sustained minor damage. \n \n\u200bPete McCarthy can be followed on Twitter: @FNP_Pete", "source": "Frederick News-Post"}
