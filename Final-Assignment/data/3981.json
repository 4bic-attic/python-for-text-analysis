Security on The Dreamboat \u2014 better known as a massive Celebrity Cruises oceanliner hired by San Francisco enterprise tech company Salesforce and docked in San Francisco's Pier 27 as part of Dreamforce, the company's annual conference \u2014 is, in a word, tight. To enter the boat, you first go to a desk and pick up your conference badge. Next, you go to an adjacent desk and check in for the appropriate party. Once you get a wristband, you can proceed to a bank of computers, where you type in your name, company affiliation, country of origin, and a state-issued ID number. It's only after that you can head to the second floor of the cement cruise terminal, which is where actual security begins. (If you get confused along the way, Salesforce workers wearing ocean-blue T-shirts that say \u201cSea me for help\u201d are plentifully scattered along your path.) At the top of the escalators, security officials check for wristbands before waving you on to the metal detectors. Pass through these, and you're on to the gangway. Here, the mood lightens \u2014 there's a bar, and more fun nautical-themed decorations, including a giant photo backdrop that reads \u201cWork like a captain, party like a pirate.\u201d View Entire List \u203a Originally Posted By BuzzFeed - Tech\tTagged as: iPhone News", "source": "iPhone Einstein"}
