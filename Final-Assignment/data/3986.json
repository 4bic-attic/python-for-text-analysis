These ghost stories have even caught the eye of Hollywood, and Producer Greg James plans to incorporate the stories in an independent film entitled \"ZOAR.\" \n \nLantern Tours take place Friday and Saturday evenings by advance reservation only. Tours begin on the steps of the historic Zoar Hotel, at 187 Main Street in Zoar. \n \nAdvance reservations are required and can be made by calling 330-874-2002, or visiting our website, www.haunted-ohio.com.", "source": "Aurora Advocate"}
