Staying here and having eaten at some of the most delicious places has made me realise that it is actually multi faceted in what it offers and goes completely beyond the regular pub brewery notion. \n \nWhile I have explored several places, some have made a deeper impact than the others \u2013 so here is what I would recommend; it is an eclectic mix of fine dining, community eating and cafes. \n \nChianti (Koramangala) \u2013 If there is any place that defines high quality fine dining and authentic Italian cuisine in Bangalore, it would be Chianti for me. Right from the d\u00e9cor, to the descriptive menu interspersed with some food history snippets, to the excellent service and the impeccable food flavours, Chianti is truly a foodie\u2019s paradise. It replicates the authentic Tuscan flavours just as I remember them from a trip years ago. \n \nWhat I ordered \u2013 Ricotta and Spinach Crostini Di Verdure, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara, Pizza Pollo Alla Griglia, Gnocchi Di Patate. \n \nKoshy\u2019s (St.Mark\u2019s Road) \u2013 Koshy\u2019s is as much a landmark as it is a legendary eatery in the heart of Bangalore. One of the oldest restaurants in Bangalore, it has retained its old world charm, a primarily Anglo Indian menu and a committed clientele. A visit to that part of the city almost always results in a meal at Koshy\u2019s. There is a certain timelessness to the place with the milling crowds that keep it vibrant with energy irrespective of the age groups they belong to and the sense of being transported back to a time when life (and food) was simple and relied on flavours, rather than presentation. \n \nWhat I ordered- French Fries, Fish fingers, Cheese Baked Chicken,Veg Au Gratin \n \nArusuvai Arasu Madhuram ( HSR Layout) \u2013 If you are looking for a traditional vegetarian Tamil fare served with a smile and on fresh banana leaves, head straight to Madhuram. It is similar to a community eating set-up and the wholesome and delicious flavours come together in the form of their piping hot Thaali. The portions are large and filling, and the variety is tremendous. They have a small counter for homemade pickles and podis as well, where one can pick up these spicy accompaniments from, for one\u2019s home. \n \nWhat I ordered \u2013 Thalai Vazhai Virunthu (Tamil Nadu\u2019s meal/thaali), Kesari, Poori Aloo \n \nArt Blend Caf\u00e9 (HSR Layout) A recent addition to the caf\u00e9 scene, the Art Blend Caf\u00e9 is a culmination of the combined passion towards art and related activities, of two individuals. From hosting artists, reading groups, mom entrepreneurs and even foodie club get-togethers, this cosy caf\u00e9 nestling in one of the tree-lined lanes of HSR is a true delight. You can catch up with friends or find your own spot to sit and read in a tranquil environment. They will win you over with a Masala / Kulhad Chai and then as you explore the menu further you have delicious food offerings to choose from. \nWhat I ordered \u2013 Masala / Kulhad Chai, Crumb Fried Chicken Burger, Mini Samosa, Dilli Aloo Chat \n \nSimran Oberoi Multani is the Founder and Chief Baker at Ovenderful \nYou can follow her at https://www.facebook.com/ovenderful and http://her.yourstory.com/simran-multani-raises-funds-", "source": "Explocity"}
