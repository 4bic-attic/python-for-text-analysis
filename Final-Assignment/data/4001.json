It features the group performing the track appearing edited over each other with multiple transparent layers. It\u2019s quite a hypnotic visual accompaniment for the wonderfully breezy and dreamy number, which is Cox and Pundt\u2019s first recorded duet. Take a look and have a listen above!", "source": "Huh Magazine"}
