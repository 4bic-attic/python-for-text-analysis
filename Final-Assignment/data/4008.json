The giveaway in this case is\u00a0the fact that the LEAF in question features a paint color that is unavailable for extant models but expected to become available for the 2016 model. Hmmm. \n \n\n \nElectrek provides more information and commentary: \n \nNissan has been careful not to release too much information about the 2016 update of its flagship electric vehicle, the LEAF, most probably not to hurt the sales of its current model. Though we learned through information leaked from dealerships that Nissan should offer a bigger battery pack option for more range in the 2016 version. The new model is expected to arrive at the end of month like most 2016 cars, but we have yet to get an official launch date or see one in the flesh, until now\u2026 \n \nBlogger JP White spotted a Nissan LEAF with a new \u2018Forged Bronze\u2019 paint job at Nissan HQ in Franklin TN (see picture above). Forged Bronze is not available for the 2015 model, but is expected to be for the 2016 version. The car also had \u201cmanufacturer tags\u201d. Since the 2016 version is not expected to see any significant exterior design changes, this could very well be a 2016 LEAF and the first sighting of one in the US. Hopefully this means we are close to the launch because Nissan\u2019s LEAF sales have been suffering lately ahead of the 2016 launch. \n \n\u2026 Or it could simply be a 2015 Nissan LEAF with a paint color that\u2019s currently unavailable to the great unwashed masses. It is the company\u2019s headquarters, after all \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s just a matter of someone getting a slight insider favor? It is a nice color, I admit. \n \nWe\u2019re hoping it\u2019s a 2016 LEAF. And hopefully we\u2019ll have a lot more info on the 2016 LEAF soon \u2014 sales have indeed been suffering . In the meantime, we covered the rumors here:\u00a0 2016 Nissan LEAF With 110-Mile Option?
