The growing prevalence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), creates an impending need for technologically advanced platforms for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimate of 3.1 million deaths occurred due to COPD in 2012, which accounted for about 5.6% of the global death toll. In 2012, nearly 6.7 million deaths occurred due to CVD stroke which accounted for about 11.9% of the global death toll. The frequent launch of smartphone based medical devices such as cardiac monitors, respiratory monitors and blood glucose monitors address the need for regular health monitoring and treatment of diseases. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141014/710132 ) \n\nTo Get More Details Kindly Visit @ http://www.bigmarketresearch.com/global-mhealth-2015-market \n\nThe global mHealth market was evaluated at $10.5 billion in 2014, and is expected to register a high CAGR of 33.5% during the forecast period (2015 to 2020).
