No, thank you. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to make the Browns\u2019 roster as a wide receiver, Pryor, the former NFL quarterback with extraordinary physical gifts, intends to earn it. He\u2019s had to go it alone most of his life, and isn\u2019t seeking favors as he faces perhaps his last chance to prolong his pro career. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being given anything,\u201d he said. \n\nSlowed by a nagging hamstring injury for the past month, Pryor may finally get to showcase his progress in switching to wide receiver today as the Browns visit the Chicago Bears in the final exhibition for both teams. Final roster cuts come Saturday. \n\nThe Browns have been impressed with Pryor\u2019s work ethic, diligence and skills in practice. They haven\u2019t seen him perform in a game, and until they do, there\u2019s no way to know if he can help them.\u00a0 \n\nCoach Mike Pettine wouldn\u2019t define this as \u201cmake or break\u201d for Pryor, but the Browns can\u2019t afford to fill a spot on their 53-man roster with potential.\u00a0 \n\nThey need playmakers. \n\nPryor had been expected to play last week at Tampa Bay, but the Browns decided to hold him out to give the hamstring extra time to heal. The 6-foot-4, 225-pounder said the frustrating injury has impeded him from bursting off the line of scrimmage, but he\u2019s determined to give it a try against the Bears. \n\nHe\u2019s not 100 percent healthy, but he\u2019s almost out of time. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will come back eventually, but right now I\u2019m dealing with the circumstances I have,\u201d he said following Tuesday\u2019s practice in steamy conditions. \u201cThat\u2019s to make a play on a leg and a half, I guess.\u201d \n\nPryor\u2019s intriguing potential has the Browns in a bit of a bind. Do they keep him on their roster based on his upside? Or risk releasing him and Pryor catching on with another team? \n\nWith Pettine expected to keep at least six wide receivers, the decision on Pryor could come down to either him or Vince Mayle, the club\u2019s fourth-round pick from Washington State. Mayle, who has struggled with dropped passes in training camp, could wind up on the practice squad. \n\nFrom the start of training camp, Pryor has drawn rave reviews from teammates. Pro Bowl cornerback Joe Haden and fellow wideout Dwayne Bowe believe that Pryor cannot only play wide receiver, but star. \n\nThe compliments have fueled Pryor. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fathom the feeling for me to have a guy like Joe Haden, Dwayne Bowe and guys like that to speak up for me on my behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that.\u201d \n\nPryor\u2019s hamstring issue could be a result of him doing more running than ever before, and he\u2019s been comforted to learn that good friend, Steelers star receiver Antonio Brown, has had the same problem this summer. \n\nPryor knows his time with Cleveland could be down to a few precious days. If he can\u2019t play, or doesn\u2019t perform well against the Bears, he may be released, which has happened to him three times before. \n\nStaying would mean a new start for Pryor, but he would rather prove he belongs. \n\n\u201cGrowing up I\u2019ve been by myself, moving out of different places by myself since I was 12 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI really didn\u2019t have a figure, people to show me the way. Anything I have I\u2019ve worked for it by myself. I want to earn everything I have or get.\u201d", "source": "Toledoblade.com"}
