Rouhani tells Steve that some in his country \"have a very negative viewpoint, they say that our counterparts, including the United States will not live up to their commitment. \n\n\"You do know that some of the congressmen and women, some of the senators here in the United States have said very clearly \u2014 or written letters to that effect \u2014 that after the end of the Obama administration, [they] will not keep the government's commitment to this agreement,\" he says. \n\n\"So, all of these are things preoccupy and worry some folks back in Iran as well,\" Rouhani continues. \n\nOn Syria, Rouhani emphasizes that predominately Shiite Tehran \u2014 supportive of the regime of President Bashar Assad \u2014 is most concerned with eliminating the threat from the Sunni-dominated Islamic State militia, which has captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and carried out atrocities against civilians in the areas they control. \n\nHe says that Iran is prepared to \"to start holding discussions and dialogues\" on a post-ISIS Syria, but that the powers allied fighting the extremist group, which includes Russia, \"must all act in unison and have a formula that is required to drive out the terrorists, immediately.\" \n\nHis remarks in the interview recorded Saturday come amid an announcement from Iraq that it has agreed to intelligence sharing with Tehran and Moscow as part of the fight against the Islamic State. Last week, Russia deployed warplanes to a forward base at Latakia, Syria , from where they are poised to conduct airstrikes against the extremist group. \n\n\"We can right now, absolutely we should speak about the upcoming options. And the Syrian government can also step in and give its opinion so that we have all of the interested parties expressing their opinions so that in aggregate we can reach a plan of action. But of course we do believe that at the end of the day, the last word and the most important word is spoken by the people\" of Syria, Rouhani tells NPR. \n\nOn Friday, in a meeting with editors, reporters and program hosts from news organizations in a hotel near the United Nations headquarters in New York, Rouhani said Tehran had \"a close relationship with Russia\" and that \"[many] weapons being used in Syria are Russian. \n\n\"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin told me recently that he wants to be more active in fighting ISIS,\" Rouhani said, but added that there was \"no coalition\" between Tehran and Moscow against the Islamic State.", "source": "WRKF.org"}
