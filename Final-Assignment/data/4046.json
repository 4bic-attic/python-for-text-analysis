If you really think about it, this theme is all about playing with the square and the cube \u2013 so bear that in mind when planning your pixel perfect wedding! \n  Create your own pixelated monogram or make up a bigger shape out of a whole lot of small pictures of the two of you.  Have guests write their special notes on square post-its and stick it on a wall to create a giant pixelated piece of art \u2013 you can even frame it that way!  Add a touch of sophistication with square pixel-inspired treats like big plates of petit fours.  In terms of chairs and seating (especially at the cocktail party), opt for square ottomans.  Rent a couple of arcade games or large square building blocks to entertain guests at the pre-drinks. You can even have prizes to keep the spirits high!  Draw inspiration from old vintage pixel-drive arcade games like Pacman and Tetris for your stationery and d\u00e9cor designs.  Combine vintage and tech by using the cross-stitching technique (which resembles pixels) to decorate napkins and dresses.  Opt for a checkerboard dance floor to further enhance the pixel theme.
