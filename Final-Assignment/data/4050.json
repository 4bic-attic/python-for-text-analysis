On those nights when you need to change it up, may we suggest this recipe for herb-crusted pork cutlets? We coat the boneless cutlets in a mixture of bread crumbs, fresh herbs (think rosemary and thyme) and Parmesan cheese. Then they get saut\u00e9ed, making the pork crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Serve the cutlets with a big green salad\u2026 but some\u00a0 shoestring fries \u00a0wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.     Click here for the recipe!\u00a0", "source": "Massillon Independent"}
