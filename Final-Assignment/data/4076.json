The report examines key trends, reviews current and emerging assays; analyzes potential applications of innovative diagnostic technologies; forecasts volume and sales for molecular diagnostic, microbial identification, antibiotic susceptibility, blood culture, urine screening and immunodiagnostic procedures, as well as over 100 infectious disease tests by assay, application, market segment; profiles leading players and potential market entrants; and suggests alternative business expansion strategies for suppliers. \n\nRationale \n\nThe level of automation in the microbiology laboratory has been lagging behind that of other major clinical laboratory segments, such as chemistry and hematology. The slow acceptance of the technology is in part due to the complexity of developing automation suitable for microbiology tests. \n\nThe introduction of automated microbiology instrumentation has been delayed by a number of intrinsic and technical problems. The diffusion of automated microbiology \r\n             systems, once the technology was developed, has not matched that of other automated laboratory technologies. The acquisition of automation in microbiology has been slowed by forces less easily identifiable than the effects of various reimbursement plans. Some laboratorians still believe that current instrumentation is not the ultimate technology and expect better automation on the horizon. \n\nThe driving force behind the need for rapid reporting of microbiological test results is the clinical relevance in a time of financial austerity, a time when cost and health care effectiveness to the patient and diagnostician looms ever larger, and where after-the-fact results at high expense are coming under severe scrutiny worldwide. \n\nThis comprehensive report will assist diagnostics industry executives, as well as companies planning to diversify into the dynamic and rapidly expanding Japanese microbiology market, in evaluating emerging opportunities and developing effective business strategies. \n\nMarket Segmentation Analysis \n\n- Sales and market shares for major suppliers by individual test. \n\n- Volume and sales forecasts for over 100 infectious disease \n\nassays by individual test: \n\n- Test volume estimates by method (molecular, serology/immunodiagnostics, \n\nculture/microscopy). \n\n- Review of the market dynamics, trends, structure, size, growth \n\nand major suppliers. \n\nSpecimen Types \n\n- Urine \n\n- Sterile Fluids: Blood, Serum, CSF \n\n- Throat Swabs, Respiratory Secretions \n\n- Genital Secretions \n\n- Stool \n\n- Abscess/Wound \n\n- Sputum \n\n- Saliva \n\nApplications \n\n- Microbial Identification \n\n- Antibiotic Susceptibility \n\n- Urine Screening \n\n- Blood Cultures \n\nReview of Major Automated Systems \n\n- Review of major automated molecular diagnostic, multipurpose, specialized, \n\nmicrobial identification, antibiotic susceptibility, blood culture, urine screening, \n\nand immunodiagnostic analyzers. \n\n- The report profiles analyzers manufactured by Abbott, Alifax, Anagen, \n\nBD, Beckman Coulter/Danaher, Biochem, Biolog, bioMerieux, Bio-Rad, \n\nBiotrol, Cepheid, Curetis, GenMark, Hologic/Gen-Probe, HTG, Iris, J&J, \n\nLabsystems, Life Technologies, MiDI, Olympus, Qiagen, Roche, Siemens, \n\nSy-Lab, Sysmex, Tecan, Thermo Fisher, Tosoh. \n\nInfectious Diseases Analyzed in the Report \n\nAIDS/HIV, Adenovirus, Aeromonads, Bartonella, Blastocystis Hominis, Campylobacter, \n\nCandida, Chancroid, Chlamydia, Clostridium, Coronavirus, Coxsackievirus, Cryptosporidium, \n\nCyclospora, CMV, E.
