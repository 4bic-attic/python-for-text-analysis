Dianne Feinstein addressed a town hall meeting in Santa Monica on Wednesday, a group of protesters took issue with her proposal to make \u201csanctuary cities\u201d such as Los Angeles comply with federal immigration law. \n \nFeinstein, speaking at an event sponsored by the World Affairs Council at the Loew\u2019s Hotel, was in town primarily to talk about the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. \n \nBut a group congregated outside the venue wanted to raise awareness of Feinstein\u2019s proposal to reform\u00a0sanctuary cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, which generally do not detain suspects based on\u00a0immigration status alone. \n \nSince the\u00a0July killing of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco that authorities say was\u00a0committed by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times,\u00a0Feinstein has pushed for sanctuary cities to hold or turn over undocumented immigrants who\u00a0have been arrested.", "source": "CBS Los Angeles"}
