It seems to apply across the board,\u201d Braun said, who was not involved in the study. \n \n\r\n\t\u00a0 \n \n\r\n\tThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which sponsored the study, announced some preliminary results on Sept. 11. The findings of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, or SPRINT, were so definitive that it was stopped earlier than planned in order to share the results quickly. \n \n\r\n\t\u00a0", "source": "Drug Store News"}
