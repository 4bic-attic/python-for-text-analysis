And she wanted the staff at the kebab place to know how she felt. Loudly. With insults. \n\nYou see, her kids only eat red peppers and the staff mistakenly used green ones in her children\u2019s meal. \n \nNow we don\u2019t know the full story here and maybe the woman was having a bad day but her reaction seems a little excessive. \n \nAfter giving out about the fact the staff weren\u2019t speaking to each other in English, the woman just gets angrier and angrier. \n \nWhen they try to explain that they can make a new one which will be ready in 15 minutes, she yells that she can\u2019t wait that long: \n \n\"15 minutes? I don\u2019t have 15 minutes for you not to know English, not to get it right the first time. You get it right the first time, the customer is always right. \n \n\"This is America and you get it right the first time.\" \n \n[embedded content] \n \nShe then storms out but her exit is less than smooth. \n \nWe guess karma really is a b*tch. \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
