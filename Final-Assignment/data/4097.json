The A330s have been progressively transferred to parent Qantas as the 787s have entered servcie. \n \nJetstar now has 11 787-8s flying on international routes across the Asia-Pacic, as well as a few domestic services within Australia. The Qantas Group\u2019s low-cost carrier\u00a0also plans to use the 787\u00a0on trans-Tasman services\u00a0 over summer . \n \nAnd the 787-8 will touch down in Wuhan, China on September 30 when Jetstar begins new twice weekly flights from the Gold Coast in partnership with Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group. \n \nJetstar said on Friday there would be more than 300 Chinese visitors on the inaugural Wuhan-Gold Coast service. \n \n\u201cThese new flights from Wuhan will be a boon for local tourism with some 70,000 seats a year on offer between the Gold Coast and one of China\u2019s fastest growing cities,\u201d Jetstar head of commercial for Australia and New Zealand Nigel Fanning said in a statement. \n \n\u201cWith a population of more than 10 million, Wuhan is the largest city in central China and it\u2019s a great sign for the Gold Coast that we\u2019re off to such a strong start with flight bookings.\u201d \n Jetstar\u2019s final Airbus A330-200 service lands in Brisbane on September 25.
