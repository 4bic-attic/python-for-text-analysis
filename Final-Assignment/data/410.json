Haliburton in its cultural and political context and to argue for his continuing relevance for students of colonialism and postcolonialism. Haliburton\u2019s The Clockmaker exposes the synchronic existence of parallel cultural geographies in the first half of the 19th century on the North American continent. Applying a settler-colonial reading to Haliburton\u2019s political satire reveals the contradictions and fractures within 19th-century definitions of Britishness, exposes the importance of political ideologies in the early articulation of British North American and US settlerhoods, and illuminates the triangulation of both these settler-colonial identities with one another and with Britain.", "source": "settler colonial studies blog"}
