Fifty years later, it\u2019s all about \u201calternative sexual lifestyles.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s basically happened is that those who have conservative moral values and biblical values, they have become the new Ku Klux Klan,\u201d said Michael Brown, an author and talk-radio host. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that gay activism is the new civil-rights movement. This is the new kid on the block that everyone\u2019s standing with.\u201d Among those standing with the \u201cgay\u201d rights movement are numerous businesses. In the\u00a02015 Corporate Equality Index,\u00a0compiled by the pro-homosexual Human Rights Campaign, a record 366 major businesses earned a perfect score of 100 percent, indicating HRC completely approves of their policies, practices and benefits for LGBT employees. In the first CEI in 2002, only 13 businesses earned a 100 percent score. And HRC claims the criteria have become more stringent over the years. Among the companies that earned a perfect 2015 CEI score were Chevron, Apple, General Motors, General Electric, Ford, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, UnitedHealth Group and JP Morgan Chase. HRC recognizes businesses that achieve a 100 percent rating as \u201cBest Places to Work for LGBT Equality\u201d and welcomes companies to tout that distinction in their marketing efforts. But for corporate America, it\u2019s not just about appealing to LGBT employees; many are trying to appeal to LGBT customers, as well. Frito-Lay launched a line of rainbow-colored Doritos last week, with proceeds going to support \u201cIt Gets Better,\u201d a nonprofit founded by the radical homosexual activist Dan Savage. As of Tuesday,\u00a0Doritos Rainbows had already sold out. At the same time, GOP presidential candidate Gov. Mike Huckabee\u00a0was challenging the Frito-Lay board of directors to watch Dan Savage in action and decide whether his lewd and offensive comments fit their corporate image. Paul Kengor, a college professor and author of\u00a0\u201cTakedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage,\u201d\u00a0believes Frito-Lay fears no backlash from conservative Christians. Instead, the company is afraid of offending gay activists. See\u00a0\u201cThe Big List of \u2018gayest\u2019 companies in America,\u201d\u00a0where support for homosexual, bisexual and transgender causes is a priority. \u201cFrom a purely marketing standpoint, one would think that corporate America might be concerned about offending traditional Christians,\u201d Kengor said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so. Christians aren\u2019t relentless and brutal like the liberal forces of \u2018tolerance\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 who boycott, picket, protest, demonize, dehumanize, fine and even incarcerate those who dare to disagree with their new definitions of marriage, family and sexuality. So corporations are happy to outrage Christians. They won\u2019t dare outrage the forces of \u2018tolerance\u2019 and \u2018diversity.\u2019\u201d Brown, a\u00a0WND columnist\u00a0and author of\u00a0\u201cOutlasting the Gay Revolution,\u201d\u00a0said companies now see an advantage in becoming more LGBT-friendly. \u201cThis is now the big thing for big business,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is good business: Let\u2019s recognize the giftedness of gays and lesbians, let\u2019s promote them to the highest level, and let us rid ourselves of those that would oppose with their old, bigoted mindsets. \u201cI have been overseas, and in other countries they\u2019ve told me the pressure they are under. I was in Singapore, and business leaders told me they are under pressure from the big companies, the Googles, the Microsofts: \u2018If you want to do business with us, then you are going to have to change your policy toward gays and lesbians.\u2019\u201d Tide recently jumped into the \u201cgay marriage\u201d debate\u00a0with a new TV commercial featuring a \u201cgay\u201d couple on their way to a church for their wedding. A woman stops them at the church steps and exclaims: \u201cHow offensive! I won\u2019t let you blemish the sanctity of marriage.\u201d She then whips out a Tide to Go pen and removes a stain from the shirt of one of the men before allowing the couple to proceed. Tide\u2019s parent company, Procter & Gamble, has\u00a0publicly promoted LGBT rights on its Twitter account. When commercial director Mark Nickelsburg posted the ad to his Facebook page, he referenced embattled Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, writing: \u201cFirst a clerk in Kentucky, and now a church lady in Los Angeles! This same sex couple faces yet another obstacle on the way to marriage equality in this spec commercial I directed.\u201d Brown does not see the \u201cgay\u201d rights movement as a simple plea for tolerance. He pointed to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who\u00a0announced last October that he is \u201cgay.\u201d\u00a0In his coming-out essay, Cook wrote he was \u201cproud to be gay\u201d and expressed hope that his announcement would \u201chelp someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone.\u201d But the following March, Cook went a step further by criticizing the religious freedom laws under consideration at the time in Arkansas and Indiana. He\u00a0called the laws \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d \u201cSo the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, now he\u2019s not just out and proud, he is at war with religious people,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe must recognize what\u2019s happening. This is not a matter of \u2018live and let live;\u2019 this is a matter of the gay revolution pushing out all opposing views, and big business is helping lead the way.\u201d Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/top-u-s-companies-at-war-with-religious-people/#citHiOBxuCP4oIZj.99\nMy comments: Homosexuality is Against God and His Word.
