They don\u2019t want their governments to turn a cold shoulder to the tragedies of the world.\u201d \n Story continues below    \n\u201cI think it\u2019s inspired such an emotional response in Canadians that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be soon forgotten,\u201d said Greg MacEachern, vice-president of government relations for Environics Communications and a former Liberal strategist. \n\n\u201cThere is a high level of outrage and a lot of questions.\u201d \n            \n Slide  \n     \nEven though the boy\u2019s aunt did not sponsor that family to settle in Canada, as originally reported \u2013 the government rejected an application from other relatives, also fleeing Syria \u2013 the issue of Canada\u2019s refugee policy had immediate effects on the campaign trail. \n\nCitizenship and Immigration minister Chris Alexander left his campaign in Ajax, Ontario to fly to Ottawa to look into the particulars of the family\u2019s case early Thursday morning. Conservative Jason Kenney postponed a planned announcement on immigration policy. And Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, NDP leader Tom Mulcair and Conservative leader Stephen Harper all addressed the Syrian refugee crisis at campaign events. \n\nThe government, and Alexander in particular, are on the defensive, MacEachern said, adding that Alexander struck the wrong tone and made factually inaccurate statements in an interview on CBC Wednesday evening. This has coloured the impression people have of the government\u2019s attitude towards refugees, MacEachern said. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very challenging to try to come back from.\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s too soon to see what effect this will have on the campaign, Bricker said. It\u2019s a complicated, emotional issue. \n\n\u201cIt might prove to have some effect, particularly if there\u2019s facts to come that demonstrate that this government has done something incorrect.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere are so many foreign-born Canadians now, particularly in places that are key ridings like the 905, and suburban Calgary and suburban Vancouver. They could be looking at images like this saying, \u2018There but the grace of God go I.\u2019\u201d \n\nMacEachern thinks that Canadians are paying attention, and it could affect how they vote. \n\n\u201cSupposedly it\u2019s a political idiom that foreign policy does not matter to the average Canadian, that it\u2019s never an election issue. Well, in politics this is an example of how you should never say never.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many people would have predicted that our policy on refugees would have become this prominent.\u201d \nHow to respond? \nPoliticians should tread carefully on this issue, MacEachern said. \n\n\u201cThere is a high level of awareness of this issue and people are watching very carefully and people don\u2019t want to see anyone of any party use this for political points.\u201d Opposition parties in particular need to be careful of being accused of using a tragedy for political gain, he said. \n\nCanadians want to see leadership from their politicians, he said. \n\n\u201cI see a lot of Canadians on Twitter, on Facebook saying we need to do something. They need someone like our government to say, \u2018This is a program you can support. This is a way you can sponsor refugees in your community.\u2019\u201d \n\nBut taking action on such a complicated issue is tough, Bricker said. \n\n\u201cOkay so we\u2019re all appalled, as we rightfully should be, about the images that we\u2019ve seen. What exactly is the solution?\u201d \n\n\u201cDo we get into a bidding war about what would be the right number of refugees to bring into the country?\u201d", "source": "Global News Canada"}
