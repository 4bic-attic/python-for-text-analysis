In the first half, we didn\u2019t play [well], the second half was a little bit better but in general we didn\u2019t deserve a victory.\u201d Benteke said. \n \n\u201cWhen I scored, I thought in my mind that maybe we could come back, but they scored to make it 3-1 and that killed our hopes. \n \nThe goal was Benteke\u2019s second since joining Liverpool over the summer from Aston Villa and it was a fantastic strike. \n \nThe challenge for the forward will be to try and go on and score 20 goals or more this season which would go some way to justifying the \u00a332.5 million fee (fee via the Guardian ) that they paid for him. \n \nWith Luis Suarez having moved on to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge suffering a number of injuries it is important that Benteke scores regularly. \n \nIf he doesn\u2019t then it is hard to see how Liverpool are going to be able to challenge for a top four spot. \n \nChristian Benteke has a shot accuracy of 50% so far this season. \n \nThe post Christian Benteke: Martial\u2019s goal \u201ckilled\u201d us on Saturday appeared first on Squawka News .", "source": "Squawka News"}
