Receiving, he made two catches for 17 yards and, punt returning, he averaged 14 yards across three returns. He also made a good punt cover tackle. \n\n\"I'm just trying to get better every game,\" he said in an on-field interview immediately after the game. \"I think tonight it was just about getting low and getting through tackles.\" \n\nAsked about his family attending the game, he said: \"It was great. They're very excited, so it was good to see them in America. It's their first time, so they've very excited.\" \n\nHayne saw limited opportunities in the first half but the Hayne Plane took off in the third quarter with a highlight reel play that makes it almost impossible for San Francisco to leave him out of their final roster. \n\nSan Francisco 49ers chief operating officer Al Guido said: \"It's really impressive ... The best analogy I can give it is that he's like Michael Jordan ... the best in his sport, taking on another sport.\" \n\n\"Jarryd laying that guy out on the 45 was impressive.\" \n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald", "source": "Cessnock Advertiser"}
