The hub will be constructed only a few kilometres from the Port of Tauranga\u2019s gates.\n\nThe move is somewhat of a \u201creturn of serve\u201d from the former in light of the latter having pioneered the inland port concept in New Zealand when establishing MetroPort Auckland 16 years ago.\n\nThe development, due to open in Triton Avenue towards the end of this year, will allow for wider competition and choice, said Ports of Auckland chief executive Tony Gibson.\n\n\u201cOur Bay of Plenty freight hub will help make New Zealand exporters more competitive on the world stage by making their access to global markets more efficient and easy,\u201d said Mr Gibson. \n\n\u201cIt also enables us to reduce excessive empty container movements and better balance the volume of exported goods with imported goods through our port. This is good for exporters, for New Zealand\u2019s supply chain logistics and for the port.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand Shippers\u2019 Council chairperson Mike Knowles views the projeect as \u201cfurther development in the competitive process\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth [ports] are major players in the New Zealand supply chain and both are important to many companies in our membership,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe ports do compete against each other and against other ports in New Zealand.\u201d \n\nExportNZ executive director Catherine Beard sees the the development positively, stating it will \u201ccreate good competition and prices for exporters and take cost out of the supply chain\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do know that it is a problem in New Zealand that we cart a lot of empties around and that costs money, so if we can do anything to reduce the cartage of fresh air, one would think that is going to translate into greater economies for exporters,\u201d says Ms Beard.\n\nThe operation, on behalf of Ports of Auckland by Toll Group with land-owner Triton Pacific building the infrastructure required, will complement the port company\u2019s existing inland freight hubs at Wiri (South Auckland) and Longburn (Manawatu).\n\nIain MacIntyre", "source": "Baird Maritime"}
