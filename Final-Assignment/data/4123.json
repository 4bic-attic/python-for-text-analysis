After a leadoff single by Mookie Betts,\u00a0David Ortiz swatted a ball into the Monster Seats for his 36th homer. \n \nThe two RBI boosted Ortiz's season total to 101, giving him his 9th\u00a0straight season of 100 or more RBI. \n \nBut the Sox could do little in the way of offense the rest of\u00a0the way. They got a one-out single from Ortiz in the fourth and a one-out\u00a0infield single from Dustin Pedroia in the sixth -- and little more. \n \nThe win enabled the Rays to take the season series from the Red Sox,\u00a010-9. In the last three losses to Tampa Bay, the Red Sox managed just six\u00a0runs after scoring eight in the series opener Monday night.", "source": "Comcast SportsNet"}
