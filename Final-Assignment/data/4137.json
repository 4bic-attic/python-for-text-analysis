Guess Which Said It! \n \nAfter ducking back inside to escape the chorus of jeers, The Donald returned two hours later, along with his son Donald, Jr . and (you guessed it) was promptly booed again! \n \nThen, in his third time heading out there, The Donald was finally chanted off stage; the crowd broke out in a spontaneous chant of \"Feo! Feo!\" which, of course, means \"ugly\" in Spanish. \n \nHa! Do NOT try to upstage the Pope! \n \nLove it!!! \n \n[Image via Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/Rob Rich/ WENN .]  \n \nTags: boo , booing , chanting , donald trump , feo , gotta have faith , jeer , new york , new york city , politik , pope francis , spanish , ugly", "source": "Perez Hilton"}
