Who doesn\u2019t?  \nMany of the \u201cBefore and After\u201d stories we see online are related to weight loss. Getting that bikini shot after losing 50 pounds is fine and all, but I find the stories about overcoming chronic illness far more inspiring. \n \nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m stoked to share one of my student\u2019s testimonials about her experience going through the Paleo Rehab: Adrenal Fatigue program. \n \nLeslie* contacted me after I asked the Paleo Rehab group to share their personal health journey related to their identification of HPA axis dysregulation (AKA \u201c adrenal fatigue \u201c) and the health improvements they had after implementing the recommendations from the program. \n \nWhen Leslie told me our program \u201csaved her life\u201d, I had to find out more. Even I was in disbelief that our program could help someone achieve that level of health success from Paleo Rehab . \n \nHow could our online program have saved someone\u2019s life? \n \nLeslie was kind enough to share her story publicly, for which I\u2019m so grateful. I hope her experience gives you hope and confidence that you too can find the root of your health problems and begin overcoming them today . \n \nThank you for your story Leslie! <3 \n \n*Name has been changed for privacy. \n Leslie\u2019s Story  \nThree years ago my health changed overnight, and my life went on hold. \n \nI would wake up every night around 1am with internal tremors in my neck, back and abdomen. They became progressively stronger throughout the night and I couldn\u2019t sleep \u2013 sometimes for days at a time. They felt like I was having a seizure but I wasn\u2019t. Occasionally the symptoms would happen during the day but for the most part it was at night. The conventional doctor initially thought it was a vitamin deficiency but I didn\u2019t improve with supplementation. \n \nMonths passed living with these symptoms. The sleep deprivation was debilitating. I couldn\u2019t understand why it was happening every night at the same time. The doctor thought it was stress and the only stress I had was from not knowing what was wrong with me. \n \nI thought my symptoms might be spine related so I went to see a Chiropractor and he was the first one to suggest \u201cadrenal fatigue.\u201d \u00a0He suggested I purchase Dr. Wilson\u2019s book but when I read it the symptoms didn\u2019t sound like mine, at the time, so I didn\u2019t give it any more thought.\u00a0 Over the years I forgot about it. \n \nNext I tried Osteopathy treatments for two years and I was told that I have a nervous system imbalance and could be fixed with osteopathy and acupuncture but it would take time. I was willing to give it time and went for treatment twice a week but there was no improvement.\u00a0 During this time I decided to see a Naturopath and when I described my symptoms he looked at me with a little smile and said nothing. He offered no possible explanation. \n \nI went back to the conventional doctor who prescribed an MRI \u2013 the results were normal.\u00a0 Then I had blood tests, x-rays and ultrasounds to rule out other conditions \u2013 they were normal. He thought the symptoms were probably menopausal and said that I am lucky because women who have hot flashes suffer more.\u00a0 My condition was not considered as bad as hot flashes.\u00a0 Basically, in a polite way, I was told to suck it up.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know where to turn to for help. It was a terrible feeling to know that something was wrong and I didn\u2019t know where to go for help. \n \nI felt abandoned and alone. \n \nI decided to try another Naturopath who said my symptoms were due to an underactive thyroid.\u00a0 After a few months on thyroid supplementation there was no improvement and I was feeling worse with additional symptoms \u2013 severe muscular pain every morning for 2 to 3 hours, low blood sugar and lack of energy \u2013 almost bedridden. With each appointment I complained about them and one day she realized it was low cortisol, which she called Adrenal Fatigue.\u00a0 She gave me an adrenal supplement but the other ingredients in this supplement didn\u2019t agree with me and I had to stop taking it. \n \nShe offered little help with my diet even though she had a nutritional background. \u00a0When I explained that I was having a very difficult time controlling sugar levels and that I was eating almost every hour and a half during the day and several times throughout the night she gave me another supplement to balance sugar levels but it didn\u2019t work. \n \nDesperate for answers I went to see an endocrinologist wondering if it really could be menopausal.\u00a0 The endocrinologist said that I didn\u2019t have an adrenal problem, that there is no precursor to Addison\u2019s disease, that I didn\u2019t have a blood sugar problem, and that what I have is a result of a stressful life. He said that those who have had a stressful life will have \u201cone heck of a time when they reach menopause\u201d. \u00a0He recommended hormone replacement therapy to get me over the hump for the next two years but I refused to take it because of the bad side effects. I didn\u2019t need any more ailments to deal with. \n \nDuring the day I tried to get some sleep. I was lucky if I got an hour or two.\u00a0 Any vitamins I tried to take made me severely dizzy for hours or made my hands tremble.\u00a0 Walking across the room felt like I was going to drop to the ground from severe exhaustion and not only physical exhaustion but I felt an internal exhaustion like I was crumbling on the inside. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and rest. \n \nEvery night I was in survival mode.\u00a0 Eat or pass out.\u00a0 \n \nHungry or not I had to eat to keep my sugar levels up and most of the time \u2013 actually all of the time \u2013 I was not hungry at all and had to force the food down. \u00a0Eating several times during the night never gave me a restful sleep and I kept my husband awake too.\u00a0 I had to get up so frequently that it would wake him.\u00a0 Sometimes the sugar levels were so low that I\u2019d be trembling and crying from fear and frustration. He\u2019d get up to sit with me in the kitchen until my body absorbed the food and the symptoms settled down. \u00a0That was a regular event.\u00a0 He was worried about my health, which then started to affect his. \n \nWhen I heard about the Paleo Rehab program I joined hoping that I could, at the very least, learn one or two things that would help me feel a bit better. \n \nThis program gave me much more than that. I am on my way to being normal again. \n \nAfter joining this program I made some diet changes: I increased protein, carb, fat and fiber intake in the recommended ratios.\u00a0 I ate super foods, such as liver, and my muscular pain improved within a week while stabilizing my blood sugar.\u00a0 To eliminate the muscle pain completely I increased soluble fiber and over a two-week period it worked \u2013 the pain is gone! \u00a0I\u2019ve been pain-free for 6 weeks now and my blood sugar is stable. \u00a0I used to eat 8 meals a day plus 1 to 3 snacks throughout the night and now I am down to 5 meals and the occasional bedtime snack if I don\u2019t eat enough calories during the day. \n \nI can finally sleep through the night. Finally. No more tremors.\u00a0Adding meditation and a few, easy lifestyle changes to my daily routine has helped a lot too. \n \nI am also working one-on-one with Kelsey Marksteiner on individualized supplementation due to other health conditions that need attention. After 2 weeks of starting the new supplementation my blood sugar problems feel almost non-existent \u2013 the best they\u2019ve ever been. \u00a0I know the sugar problem is there and I am in the healing stages so I won\u2019t do anything crazy like go on a restrictive diet and act like it\u2019s not a problem.\u00a0 I know the problem is still there, but it does feel like it\u2019s getting back to normal. \n \nI am healing. \n \nMy energy level is still low but I am confident that it will improve as well.\u00a0 I know what and how much to eat to get and keep myself healthy.\u00a0Today I understand that the tremors I had were caused from adrenaline peaks occurring around 1am and lowering blood sugar levels.\u00a0 \u00a0Cortisol is supposed to kick in to raise it but mine never did and my sugar levels remained low. \u00a0I was miserable every day from sleep deprivation, exhaustion and pain.\u00a0 I stopped driving because I was afraid I\u2019d fall asleep at the wheel. \n \nOnce I started sleeping through the night I was in a better mood \u2013 happier \u2013 and I could go out and do the things I used to do.\u00a0My husband is so happy to see me getting back to normal \u2013 and so am I. \n \nWould you believe that I had spent close to $10,000 on healthcare practitioners with nothing to show for it? \u00a0 \n \nIt\u2019s hard to enjoy life when you don\u2019t feel well and I was not going to give up on finding someone who could help me. I am so happy that I found the Paleo Rehab program .\u00a0 The amount and the quality of the material are impressive and it is obvious how much time \u2013 and love \u2013 was put into it.\u00a0 It is more than I ever expected. \n \nLaura and Kelsey \u2013 you saved my life. \n \nYes, that is exactly how I feel and I am not ashamed to say it even though it may sound exaggerated.\u00a0 What I went through was horrible and only my husband knows the extent because he was there to witness it. \n \nYou helped me when no one else could and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without you. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThank. You. So. Much. \n \n- Leslie", "source": "Ancestralize Me"}
