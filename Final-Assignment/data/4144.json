The 17-year-old, who had broken his leg and was bored at home, sat playing Defence of the Ancients almost continuously, only stopping to sleep and eat.\n\nInvestigators discovered the boy, known as Rustam, had spent over 2000 hours playing the game in the past year and a half, which works out at around 6 1/2 hours a day culminating in the intensive almost non-stop sessions over the past 22 days.\n\nDoctors believe he could have died from DVT where someone suffers a thrombosis because they are not moving around very much, like on a cramped long-haul flight.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Svetlana Abramova confirmed: \u201cIn the last 22 days there is a suspicion he played the game almost all the time, stopping only to take a nap and grab a snack. Source: australscope \n\n\u201cSince the 8th August he had a broken leg and has spent all his time at home playing computer games\u201d.\n\nPavel Astakhov, a youth behaviour specialist, said: \u201cIt is important to follow what your kids are doing.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the 17-year-old, there is a suspicion he spent what was the equivalent of 83 whole days online out of the past year and a half.\n\n\u201cA dependence on computer games is one of biggest dangers for the kids nowadays\u201d.\n\nMedical expert Azat Hafizov explained what could have happened: \u201cPeople can suffer from such problems during long flights when they are forced to sit.\n\n\u201cThe boy presumably died from a thrombosis. They are appearing in 50 per cent of cases when people have fractures.\u201d\n\nThe boy reportedly collapsed as his virtual online persona was also killed in the game.", "source": "NEWS.com.au"}
