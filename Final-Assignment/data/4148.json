I will be spending my whole Christmas here and everyone has been so welcoming,\u201d Ms Lee said. \n\nShe is also looking forward to sampling the town\u2019s restaurants, especially for the fish. \n\n\u201cI hope everyone will come along and enjoy themselves. It is such a great tradition we have in this country,\u201d she said. \n\nJohn Lyons, who is most famous for his role as detective sergeant George Toolan in A Touch of Frost, will be playing King Crumble and Asa Elliott - who has appeared in the ITV series Benidorm - will take on the role of Prince Valiant. \n\nAsa Elliott said: \u201cThe panto is often children\u2019s first time at the theatre so it is really special to be part of that. \n\n\u201cIt is great to come back to this theatre and see it is being restored when so many are shutting down.\u201d \n\nThe pantomime opens on Tuesday, December 15 and runs until Saturday, January 2. \n\nGo to www.marinatheatre.co.uk or call 01502 533200 to book tickets. \n\nAre you part of a community group which is organising a pantomime for this festive season?
