As a White House fellow, it\u2019s your job to pick it up and bring it to him. Except when you get to the Oval Office, the door locks behind you. You can\u2019t get out until you figure out what\u2019s missing from the speech. What do you do? \n \nSo goes the scenario for Escape the Oval Office, one of two escape room-style games at D.C.\u2019s brand new Escape Lounge , which opened in July on H Street NE. With roots in video game culture, escape rooms are cropping up in cities across the country. Aptly named, they are essentially rooms that you have to escape by answering clues, solving riddles, or finding hints that lead you to the key. They\u2019ve become somewhat of a thing in the city in the past year, as WAMU noted last month , making the Escape Lounge the third to open since October. \n \nThis particular game lounge is also getting attention for having the city\u2019s first escape room game set in the White House\u2014though co-founder Ayanna Smith says that wasn\u2019t the original intention. Smith, her husband, and their business partner wanted to launch a family entertainment business and, upon learning about escape rooms, decided to start the kid-friendly 30-minute-long Escape the Classroom game. They opened Escape the Oval Office at the same time, though, and it quickly become the main attraction. \n \n\u201cThe Oval Office is a little more popular now, because of the D.C. theme,\u201d Smith says, adding that she\u2019s noticed it\u2019s an especially popular theme for tourists wanting to making their vacation as D.C.-centric as possible. \n \nEscape the Oval Office is a little bit different than some of the other escape rooms around town, which Smith warns visitors should know in advance. Rather than a linear style of play\u2014where Clue #1 takes you to Clue #2, and so on, down a numbered list of clues\u2014the Oval Office offers a lot of repeated clues in different locations around the office to help you find that missing piece from the president\u2019s speech. \n \nAt first, this was hard for Washingtonians to grasp. Rare was the team that actually completed the puzzle and escaped the room, which led to some serious frustration in the Escape Lounge\u2019s first weeks. Though Smith says that escape rooms \u201ctake a lot of pride in low escape numbers,\u201d she acknowledged that frustration, especially among the competitive types these games attract. So in the past month, the Escape Lounge has started ramping up the last-minute hints the staff offers players. Now, about 50 percent of players escape before the end of the hour-long Escape the Oval Office game. \n \nEven if you do escape, these rooms are designed to allow you to come back for more. Every few months or so, The Escape Lounge intends to change up the scenario of both Escape the Oval Office and Escape the Classroom\u2014keeping the themes, but changing the hints and the key needed to exit. \n \nBoth themed games are offered Wednesday to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; it's $25 per person. Smith says Escape the Oval Office books up quickly for its weekend sessions, so get a jump on those reservations. Each game is meant to be played with five to 10 people, so if your group is smaller you might find yourself escaping the room with strangers. Given the popularity these games have as team-building exercises, though, those strangers might be new friends by the time you get out. \n \nAmy McKeever is on the D.C. beat for Travel + Leisure .
