Now he is just another POW at the fiercely guarded Stalag Luft 13 in Bavaria.\n\nThen routine comes to a halt with the arrival of a new prisoner: First Lieutenant Lincoln Scott, an African American Tuskegee airman who instantly becomes the target of contempt from his fellow soldiers. When a prisoner is brutally murdered, and all the blood-soaked evidence points to Scott, Hart is tapped to defend the soldier. In a trial rife with racial tension and raw conflict, where the lines between ally and enemy blur, there are those with their own secret motives, and a burning passion for a rush to judgment, no matter what the cost.\n*\n\nIf you enjoyed this post,  get free updates by RSS Or by Email.", "source": "Randomize ME"}
