State veterinarian Jim Logan says it is not a human safety risk. \n\nAbout 20 locations in the state are currently under quarantine due to vesicular stomatitis. Over the year, 80 in nine Wyoming counties have been quarantined. \n\nThe disease, which is thought to be spread by insects that migrate along river valleys, can cause blisters, sores, sloughing of skin and lameness in animals.", "source": "Belleville News Democrat"}
