Well...the song is California and the band is Jamestown Revival. Actually, who am I to say that you didn't already know the band and the song. After all, this is Austin and your popularity rating is directly related to how tied into the music scene you really are. Perhaps you already knew that their album \"UTAH\" won \"Best Singer/Songwriter Album of the Year\" by iTunes, that they were featured on Artist Spotlight at Republic Records, or that they are Texas State Alumni. REGARDLESS - I was pleasantly surprised to find out how close to home these guys hit. Top it all off with recently-local-to-Austin-via-Iceland band Kaleo\u00a0opening up, and you have a most excellent evening!\n\n[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"2374,2373,2375,2376,2386,2378,2377,2379,2380,2384,2385,2387,2388,2389,2390,2391,2392\"]", "source": "alivenlight"}
