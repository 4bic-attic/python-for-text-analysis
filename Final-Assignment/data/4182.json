Discuss!", "id": "672577db-14a9-45ca-bdf5-924d74928d1e", "content": "Sanity is knowing what you want to do in any given situation\u2014from an hour in a book store to a long weekend with your family to a professional career.\rMind you, it is not in getting what you want in every situation, or even in most situations. It's just knowing what you want. It's the people who don't know what they want\u2014or can't manage to separate what they want from what their friends, lovers, children or bosses want\u2014these are the people who have a hard time in life, and who struggle in relationships.\rYou can't communicate what you don't know, and if you don't know your own interest, you can't let others know you you are.\rAnd you wind up feeling lonely, which doesn't help matters either.", "source": "Writing Boots"}
