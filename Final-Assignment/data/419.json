I've got the link of your website from a good friend of mine in the beginning of the year. At that time, my uncle was diagnosed with pancreas cancer stage 2. My uncle and his family members decided to take the advice from the attending doctor to do chemotherapy. He had since gone through a series of chemotherapy and further extended to radiotherapy.\n\nLast month, my uncle was admitted to hospital due to severe sore throat, which believed to be the side effect of radiotherapy and continued to be warded until today. His health condition did not get better but deteriorated since hospitalization. 3 weeks after hospitalization, the attending doctor suddenly broke the news to my aunt and cousins that my uncle was diagnosed with liver cancer stage 4 and announced that he is left with 2 months of life. It was devastating as we all thought my uncle was actually recuperating. He is now very weak and bedridden.\n\nI had passed your contact to my cousin early of the year and until today she didn't make that move to contact you. It seems to me that they are losing faith and giving up hopes. I'm writing this letter to seek for your professional advice as in what can I do to help my uncle or his family members?\n\nLooking forward to hear from you soon. Your kind advice would be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks and best regards.\n\nReply: Nothing anybody can do in this case. Let the doctor takes care of him. No one can cure any cancer.", "source": "A Day With              Chris Teo"}
