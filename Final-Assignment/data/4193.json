Each morning he\u2019d race into the parking lot in a secondhand Oldsmobile 98 sedan, then sprint upstairs to his office. \u201cIt was like he never slept,\u201d says one former employee. \u201cHe could be really rough when he was mad about something. He could shame you. But you knew why, and you knew you\u2019d screwed up. If you were as passionate as he was, he loved you, but if not, you were gone.\u201d In quieter moments Olsen would regale employees about the lost city of Atlantis or Heyerdahl\u2019s discoveries. They called such sessions \u201cgoing to the moon.\u201d\n\nThe precursor to\u00a0\u201cmoonshots\u201d?\nAlthough former associates say Olsen is a brutally tough businessman, in our discussions he never mentioned profits and rarely cited numbers when talking about his latest investments. For Olsen, renewable energy is more an ethical calling than a business imperative. His long experience in petroleum production convinces him that the world isn\u2019t facing a shortage of oil or even a future of ultrahigh prices. But renewables are essential, he says, to counter global warming. \u201cIf this warming continues, the oceans will rise, and the place we\u2019re sitting now, and many cities, will be under water,\u201d says Olsen, who drives a Tesla Model S. His principal crusade is protecting the Arctic from the drilling and shipping traffic that fracture the polar icecap. \u201cI used to fly over the North Pole, and all you saw was thick, white ice, cracked like the surface of an old painting,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you see lots of black water, and that accelerates the heating of the oceans.\u201d\n\nMaybe the last guy you\u2019d expect to take up such a cause, and he truly champions it.\u00a0\nBack in his office, Olsen is reflecting on his long career, in which change has been just about the only constant. \u201cBoth products and family businesses obey life cycles,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother\u2019s family was in fishhooks and horseshoe nails. Those businesses came and went. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to catch the wave, to keep innovating, keep changing.\u201d In Olsen\u2019s case, that\u2019s been the blueprint for a most interesting life.\u2002\n\nGreat advice. Also look for the part where Fortune debunks the notion that Olsen was the inspiration and model for C. Montgomery Burns \u2013 to which Olsen responds,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m thankful!\u201d", "source": "ParisLemon"}
