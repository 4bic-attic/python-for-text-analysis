But the Kremlin denies that a phone conversation between the singer of \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d and the Russian leader ever took place. \n \n\n \nJohn, who is a high-profile gay rights advocate, expressed his wish in a Sep. 12 interview with the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s probably pie in the sky\u2026 He may laugh behind my back when he shuts the door, and call me an absolute idiot, but at least I can think I have the conscience to say I tried,\u201d he said. \n \nRussia introduced a law forbidding \u201cgay propaganda\u201d in 2013, effectively sanctioning discrimination against LGBT people. Attacks against members of the gay community are also prevalent in the country, according to Human Rights Watch. \n \nThe Kremlin is vehement that the conversation did not happen. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know who spoke to Elton John but President Putin did not speak to him,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC . \u201cIf the president does get such a signal from Elton John, the president has always been open to discuss any\u2026 human rights problems, any issues. He is always ready to clarify the real situation.\u201d", "source": "Quartz"}
