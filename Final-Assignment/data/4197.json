We got an iPhone 6 and a Leap motion controller device as the mega prize. Being a big fan of Android that I am, I was not interested in switching to iPhone and gave it to my wife. I have been playing around with leap motion controller for sometime. Leap motion is a plug-n-play device which can sense your hand movements to control your computer. I was quite surprised at the accuracy with which the device is able to detect the fingers, palms, hands and arms. The visualizer app which comes with the device helps in visualizing your hands in 3-dimensional space. Leap motion provides SDK for us to integrate with our applications.\u00a0\n\nPlaying HTML5 copter with leap motion controllerAs a hello-world, I have added leap motion support (using JavaScript SDK) in the HTML5 copter project which I have worked on few years back. If you have a leap motion device, just plug-in the device to control the copter with your hand gestures (up, down, left, right). Try out the copter game here -- http://copter.varunkumar.me. Check out the video of me playing the game with my hand gestures (recorded #throughglass). Source is available here.\n-- Varun", "source": "Varun's ScratchPad"}
