The new information includes \n      estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a \n      growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal \n      exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the \n      relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of \n      Labor. \n  \n Inflation Adjustments - Background  \n \nSince the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income \n      tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation \n      adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent \n      years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over \n      50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption \n      and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed \n      to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. \n \n Media Assistance  \n \nExpert analysis plus additional details regarding the following \n      projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in \n      speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. \n      For interview requests, please contact Laura Gingiss ( laura.gingiss@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2213 or Eric Scott ( eric.scott@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2179. \n \n Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : \n \nProjections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the \n      12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest \n      most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax \n      filings. For example: \n Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have \n        increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe \n        $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate \n        brackets between 2015 and 2016.  A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of \n        $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on \n        the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for \n        2016.  The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals \n        claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at \n        $1,050 for 2016.  The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or \n        who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 \n        additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.  \n Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016:  \n The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to \n        $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015.  The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married \n        filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The \n        standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from \n        $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard \n        deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the \n        taxpayer's taxable income.  Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 \n        alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will \n            be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015.  For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 \n            exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015.  For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, \n            up from $41,700 in 2015.   The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax \n        bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer \n        Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer \n        projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate \n        will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers  $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households  $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers  $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers  These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on \n            that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains \n            and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts.   The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 \n        million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation \n        by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal \n        portability election can now effectively protect double that amount \n        against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016).  The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for \n        2016, up from $100,800 for 2015.  The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA \n        contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from \n        $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015.  \n Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US 2016 Tax \n      Projections *  \n \nAs cited earlier, Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projections for \n      indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the \n      U.S. Department of Labor. The IRS usually releases official numbers by \n      December each year. \n \nTax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and \n      should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax \n      related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year. \n \n Married Filing Jointly (& Surviving Spouse)  \n \u00c2\u00a0  \u00c2\u00a0  \u00c2\u00a0
