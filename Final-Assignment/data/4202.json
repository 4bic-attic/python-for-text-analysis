Source: Supplied  \n        \n JODI Eaton\u2019s killer has earned a place among the state\u2019s worst murderers \u00adbecause of his shocking crime, his efforts to conceal it and a brutal history of violence against women.  \n   \nDarren Michael Dobson, 38, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the callous murder of the Sorell mother of two in February last year. \n\nChief Justice Alan Blow ordered he not be eligible for parole until 2029. \n\n\u201c[Dobson\u2019s] tendency to commit serious crimes of \u00adviolence against women and his callous behaviour in hiding and disposing of [Ms Eaton\u2019s] body during the 48 hours after the killing do place this case in the worst category of murder cases,\u201d Chief Justice Blow said. \n\nDobson pleaded guilty to strangling Ms Eaton in the Gagebrook home of a mutual friend. No motive for the murder has emerged except that Dobson \u2013 an ice addict \u2013 flew into a blind rage after an argument with Ms Eaton, with whom he was socialising at a party that evening. \n  \nSoon after the murder he hid her body under the house. \n\nThe next night he took the body in a friend\u2019s car to his uncle Maxwell Douglas Morrison\u2019s farm at Pelham. \n\nThere he buried the body in a remote location. \n\nPolice found the shallow grave 19 days later and took Dobson, who was on bail at the time, into custody. \n\n\u201cThose who were close to her underwent a terrible \u00adordeal during those 19 days,\u201d Chief Justice Blow said. \n\n\u201cHer daughters were aged nine and five at the time. \n\n\u201cThey have lost their mother and their family home. \n\n\u201cIt has been a very disturbing time for both of them, in all sorts of ways. \n\n\u201cThe problems caused to them by their mother\u2019s murder are many and ongoing.\u201d \n\nMs Eaton\u2019s partner at the time has been rocked by the murder. \n\nHe received several missed calls from Ms Eaton on the night of her death. \n\nOne call went through to his message bank and a distressed Ms Eaton can be heard saying \u201cleave me alone\u201d or \u201cget off me\u201d. \n\n\u201cHe says that he is haunted by what happened every day,\u201d Chief Justice Blow said. \n\nThe victim\u2019s mother has several psychological symptoms and \u201cfeels that her life is now meaningless\u201d. \n\n\u201cOne should not overlook the impact that this crime may have had on the police officers who had the gruesome tasks of exhuming and photographing the decomposing body,\u201d the judge said. \n\nSupporters of Ms Eaton described Dobson as a maggot as he was led away from the Supreme Court. \n\nChief Justice Blow also detailed Dobson\u2019s disturbing history of domestic violence. \n\nOnce he chased his partner, who was five months pregnant, into the street where he choked her to unconsciousness. He kept punching her until police capsicum sprayed him to stop. \n\nIn 1998, he was sentenced to seven years\u2019 jail for raping a woman \u2013 who woke to find Dobson strangling her \u2013 three times. \n\nSee Wednesday\u2019s Mercury to read what Ms Eaton\u2019s family had to say about the sentencing.", "source": "Tasmania Mercury"}
