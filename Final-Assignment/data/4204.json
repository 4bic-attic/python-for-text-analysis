After making an initial $5,000 donation to the foundation at the start of The Barclays, Horizon BCBSNJ challenged PGA TOUR golfer and NJ native Morgan Hoffmann to add more by wearing a fitbit, pledging to add another $1,000 for every 10,000 steps Hoffmann logged during play at the Plainfield Country Club in Edison.\n\nAfter competing in every round of the tournament, Hoffmann recorded 62,000 steps, adding $6,000 to the original $5,000 charitable donation, and bringing Horizon BCBSNJ\u2019s total donation to $11,000.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thank Morgan for giving back to his New Jersey roots while setting an example of how walking can contribute to a healthy and active lifestyle,\u201d said Jonathan R. Pearson, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility for Horizon BCBSNJ. \n\nThis was the sixth year of the collaboration between Horizon BCBSNJ and The Barclays. Horizon was on the course encouraging spectators to participate in a variety of health-related games and activities at its Health and Wellness Expo. This year, Horizon BCBSNJ was also the presenting sponsor of The Barclays Youth Day Golf Clinic.\n\n\u201cHorizon\u2019s donation, combined with Morgan\u2019s efforts, will help us expand our youth programs so that even more children can participate,\u201d said Chris Hunt, Executive Director of the New Jersey Golf Foundation. \u201cThe support we receive from Horizon and Morgan Hoffmann helps\n\n'/\"/", "source": "Bio-Medicine"}
