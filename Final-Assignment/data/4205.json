Composed, performed and tracked by members Matti M\u00e4kel\u00e4 and Lauri Lindqvist with additional percussion by Jussi-Pekka Manner and mastered by D. Lowndes at Resonance Sound Studio (Absu, Pallbearer, Profetus, Sigh, Wodensthrone etc.), Aeons In Tectonic Interment is a traumatic, fifty-one-minute audio apocalypse where misanthropy, suffering and imminent ruin become one achieving purification through sonic degeneration. \n \n\u201c Aeons In Tectonic Interment\u00a0 is an imperious, ambitious listen; the \u2018death\u2019 aspect of their corroded death/doom takes the reins, allowing the doomier tempo and atmosphere to decay around it,\u201d issues Noisey of the opus, further noting \u201cIts graceless, lumbering pace is almost unbearably slow, adding to the tension that hangs between the ringing notes and the pregnant pauses\u00a0before each\u00a0drawn-out roars\u00a0erupts.\u201d Elsewhere Decibel Magazine notes, \u201c TYRANNY have chosen to play all their music in the key of crushing.\u201d Glacially Musical concurs, \u201cThe ringing, sludgy chords, the forlorn vocals, the wisps of melody, it all adds up to an immersing experience. TYRANNY has made a depressing, metal, vicious Pink Floyd album from their pre- Darkside Of The Moon \u00a0Era. Settle in, this ride will be long and bumpy, but worth it.\u201d Abysmal Hymns calls the record, \u201cheavy as fuck,\u201d warning, \u201cThis album goes to the extreme to grind you down with its weight.\u201d Metal Injection likens the band to the \u201ccrawl of a spider web-laden crypt, \u201c while We Love Metal adds, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any darker than TYRANNY \u2026 The droning and depression ensuring tracks off\u2026 Aeons In Tectonic Interment cement the darkness\u2026 \u201c \n Get gloomy with a helping of \u201cA Voice Given Unto Ruin,\u201d courtesy of Decibel Magazine at THIS LOCATION .  \nAnd if you missed it, sample \u201cSunless Deluge\u201d still streaming at Noisey at THIS LOCATION . \n \nForged in 2001 by M\u00e4kel\u00e4 and Lindqvist, TYRANNY was conceived under the strain of a Stranger Will to channel the Ageless resonations of Earth and Oceans and sonorous visions and fevered dreams by the means of epic, Funereal Soundscapes. \n \nAeons In Tectonic Interment will see release via Dark Descent Records on CD, double LP and digitally on September 18th, 2015.
