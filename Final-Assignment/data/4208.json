Four years later this goal has been accomplished. During that time Catapult became the only HLS tool that can automatically generate production-quality RTL from a C/C++ and SystemC description, establishing Catapult as the technology and market leader. The readiness of customers such as Google, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and ST Microelectronics to publicly discuss their production results using Catapult at events like the Design Automation Conference (DAC) shows just how impactful the technology is. \n\nThe successful integration of Catapult with Calypto's SLEC\u00ae technology will provide customers with the best solution for C-to-RTL verification regardless of their system-level design language of choice. \n\nCalypto's power optimization platform, PowerPro\u00ae is seeing strong adoption at leading edge semiconductor companies. PowerPro is a full suite of RTL power optimization tools featuring new RTL power analysis capabilities, production-proven optimization techniques for reducing dynamic and leakage power in the logic, memory, and embedded processor section of a SoC, and is the only solution that provides sequential formal equivalence checking. \n\n\"Calypto has been on a great path with its superior technology,\" stated Badru Agarwala \n\nAbout Mentor Graphics\n\nMentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) is a world leader in electronic hardware and software design solutions, providing products, consulting services and award-winning support for the world's most successful electronic, semiconductor and systems companies.
