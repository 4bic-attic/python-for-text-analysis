So once we receive a diminution of sentence order, we don\u2019t have a choice but to follow the law and release him.\u201d \n\nMitchell had been transferred from Avoyelles Parish to the Tensas Parish Detention Center to serve out a sentence for drug and battery charges unrelated to the Abbeville murder. He was released from the Tensas jail March 1. \n\nBut Mitchell had also been indicted in the Dec. 20, 2012 killing of Darrell Broussard Jr., 25, of Abbeville, and should have been awaiting trail for that crime. \n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we didn\u2019t make a mistake in Tensas Parish,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf there had been a detainer placed on him we could have held him for 10 more days until he could be picked up.\u201d \n\nGannett Louisiana has reached out to the Louisiana Department of Corrections for comment. \n\nMitchell is now being held in the San Joaquin County Jail on a fugitive warrant, according to an Associated Press story. He will be transported back to Louisiana after he waives an extradition hearing or has a hearing this week. \n\nFollow Greg Hilburn on Twitter @GregHilburn1 \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/09/28/tensas-sheriff-choice-releasing-accused-murderer/72977118/", "source": "Opelousas Daily World"}
