It also represents a large amount of waste, with around \u00a390 million worth of unused prescription medicines in people\u2019s homes across the UK at any one time. With a few simple considerations, people could help save the NHS millions each year.\u201d\rIn Sefton, the \u00a32 million that could potentially be saved through better medicine management could be spent on:\r79 more nurses OR\r2,000 more drug treatment courses for Alzheimer\u2019s OR\r132 more drug treatment courses for breast cancer OR\r539 more hip replacements OR\r2,081 more cataract operations\rDr Craig Gillespie, chair of NHS South Sefton CCG, added:\r\u201c We want patients on repeat prescriptions to think about what they are ordering and only ask for what they need and are running out of. Any of their medicines can be dispensed when needed at a later date, as once medicines have been dispensed, they cannot be recycled.\n\u201cIn addition, we are encouraging everyone involved in prescribing, dispensing or reviewing medicines to make sure that their patients are fully involved in making decisions about their treatment, to ensure that more people take their medicines correctly because they have a fuller understanding of why it\u2019s important to take medications as they\u2019re recommended to.\u201d\rAround half of the UK population do not take or use their medicines as prescribed. This can occur for a number of reasons, including:\nPatients not believing the medicine is necessary\rPossible side effects\rFitting taking or using medicines into daily routines\rChoosing between medicines if patients\u2019 feel they are taking too many\rCutting down or stopping medicines they have been taking for a long time\rHealth professionals across the region have joined forces in a bid to inform patients and carers about their treatment and to help people understand more about their medicines and the options they have.\nSusanne Lynch, head of medicines management for both CCGs, said:\r\u201cThis campaign is a great example of doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and care homes working together to raise awareness amongst patients and carers of this important issue, and people will be able to pick up a leaflet from their GP practice or local pharmacy to find out more.\u201d\rShe concluded:\r\u201cWe\u2019d also encourage anyone with questions about their medicines, no matter how small, to speak to their pharmacist or doctor who will be able to give help and advice about getting the most from their medicines. It\u2019s so important that people take their medicines as directed to ensure they get the maximum benefit, and health professionals will be more than happy to answer people\u2019s queries or concerns.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nPosters and leaflets are being displayed in pharmacies, GP practices and hospitals.
