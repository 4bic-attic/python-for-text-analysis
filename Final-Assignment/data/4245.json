Jonathan S. Spaner, commanding officer of Coast Guard Sector San Diego. \u201cIndeed, transnational organized crime poses threats of both safety and security to our Nation. With tremendous support from the community, the Department of Homeland Security and our partners in San Diego are working very hard to detect and diminish maritime trafficking in the region.\u201d \n \nThe MTF and San Diego Regional Coordinating Mechanism are comprised of U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Office of Field Operations, Office of Air and Marine, U.S. Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Coast Guard and other federal, state and local partners. Collectively, these regional partners conduct interagency operational planning and leverage agency authorities and jurisdictions to combat threat networks that seek to exploit the maritime approaches to the U.S. \n \nThe Adelie is an 87-foot Coast Guard cutter home ported in Port Angeles, Washington.", "source": "Coast Guard News"}
