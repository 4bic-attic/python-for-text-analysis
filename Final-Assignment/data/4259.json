New trends can therefore be discovered, new sub markets defined, compared and ranked.\u00a0 \n\nFind out more about Weiss Residential Research:\u00a0 https://www.weissindex.com \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/number-of-homes-gaining-value-falls-to-57-percent-nationwide-300146440.html \n\nSOURCE  Weiss Residential Research", "source": "U-T San Diego"}
