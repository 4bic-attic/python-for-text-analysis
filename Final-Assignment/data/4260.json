The Hokies will have a maroon on maroon ensemble to go with their shiny orange helmets. (I'm not sure why there's blurring in the picture they released. Perhaps because Tech's players are running so fast?)\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good look. It's the Orange Effect game, so I think the fear among fans was that they would pair the orange helmets with orange unis, which is an awful look for anyone not on a hunting trip.", "source": "Roanoke Times"}
