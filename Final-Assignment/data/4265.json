Hell, they even went the route of hiring Phish axeman, Trey Anastasio, to lead the crew of jam band originators with their farewell shows in Chicago recently. \n \nBut it wasn\u2019t until Ratdog\u2019s frontman, Bob Weir, jammed with Hollywood hearthrob and hired gun John Mayer that a match was made in patchouli heaven. Several dates were announced recently that included only East Coast and West Coast dates, with no Denver date. That left many at Sancho\u2019s Broken Arrow a little misty-eyed. \n \nThat has changed with the announcement of a two-night stint at the jam-friendly 1stBank Center during Thanksgiving week, Nov. 24-25.
