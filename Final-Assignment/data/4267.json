In this report, revenue from the total shipment (consumption value) of quantum dots in all forms (such as quantum dot films and quantum dot lasers) is considered to present the market size for the base year 2014. \n\n4K UHD TVs are gaining popularity among consumers. For instance, Samsung shifted from producing 4K OLED TVs to producing quantum dot-based LED-LCD 4K TVs, owing to the high development cost of 4K OLEDs. The integration of quantum dots in display devices is expected to create revenue for the market. Following Samsung, other TV manufacturers are likely to develop TVs integrated with quantum dots because of the profitability they offer. Also, the increased production of quantum dot-based TVs will lead to more partnerships between TV manufacturers and quantum dot vendors, thus establishing a stable supply chain. \n\nAccording to the report, quantum dots are used in LCD devices such as TVs, smartphones, and tablets. These devices use LED backlights for display, where a film of quantum dots is inserted between the backlight and the display to enhance the color gamut. The size tenability and narrow color-band frequency emission of quantum dots enable them to manage the brightness of the display while ensuring 80% less power consumption than LCD and OLED displays. Samsung and Sony are developing quantum dot-based 4K and 8K LED LCD TVs, given the cost benefits in comparison to emerging OLED technology. Quantum dots are also used in other optoelectronic devices such as lasers and telecom components to increase their efficiency. While the footprint of quantum dots in optoelectronics is currently low, it is expected to pick up with an increase in product developments. \n\nFurther, the report states that quantum dots are highly priced, restricting their penetration in growing sectors such as LED lighting, LCD TVs, and solar modules. \n\nThe applications considered for calculation of market size include: \n\n- Healthcare \n- Life sciences \n- Medical equipment \n- LED lighting \n- Optoelectronics \n- LED LCD displays \n- Optoelectronic components used in telecom sector \n- Solar modules \n- Others \n- Research and study (educational institutions) \n- Flash memory \n- Identification tagging \n- Lasers \n- Quantum computing \n- Security and surveillance \n- Sensors for biohazard detection \n\nKey vendors \n\n- Nanoco Group \n- Nanosys \n- Ocean NanoTech \n- QD Laser \n- QD Vision \n- Quantum Materials \n\nOther prominent vendors \n\n- Nano Axis \n- Nn-Labs \n- Samsung \n- Sigma-Aldrich \n- Siva Power (Solexant) \n- Voxtel \n\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t9zrs8/global_quantum  \n\nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-quantum-dots-market-2015-2019-with---nanoco-group-nanosys-ocean-nanotech-qd-laser-qd-vision--quantum-materials-dominating-300140939.html \n\nSOURCE  Research and Markets", "source": "A.M.
