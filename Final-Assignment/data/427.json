It's a gloomy day here but I love gloomy days AND I was able to spend a little time in my stamp room so I am a happy stamper! Today I have a little note card to share. \u00a0I stamped the sweet Red Rubber Designs Charming Gardens bird bath on this pretty 2 3/8 x 3 3/8 mini card then colored the image and added the pointillism technique. \u00a0 The card will slip neatly into this fun fold envie. I hope you will stop by Red Rubber Designs store and take a look at this stamp set as well as new the new arrivals!
