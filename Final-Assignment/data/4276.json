Anyway, \u00a0later on I kept hearing Looking For You at various soul do's but was never able to source a copy. At that time I wasn't aware that it was the flip side of the 1966 release I'll Take Good Care Of You. Earlier this year the fact that this was to be released as an RSD15 release nearly got me out of my bed at 05:30 but not quite. Fortunately when I visited Monorail the following day there was a copy which was duly purchased and has been played regularly since.\nMr Mimms is still with us at the age of 81. He stopped recording in 1977 became a born again Christian and found a career as a minister returning to recording in 2007 and releasing a Gospel album. His biggest hit was Cry Baby released in 1963, a song which would later become a staple of Janis Joplin's.\nGarnett Mimms - Looking For You", "source": "Across The Kitchen Table"}
