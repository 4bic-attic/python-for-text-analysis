I am fed up with people abusing handicap parking; putting up their sticker and sitting in the car, this is against the rules. You are supposed to drop the person off then find a parking spot then return and pick them up.\n\nThe parking is for people who drive the car and are handicapped to park and do their business then return, or escort the handicapped person to do their shopping.\n\nNot park and stay in the car as you are taking a spot from someone who needs it. Sometimes the extra walk from a distant parking spot can be an ordeal for the person doing it.\n\nPlease, holders of a permit, do the correct thing and leave the parking spot clear and park elsewhere if only dropping someone off.\n\nIn future, I am taking a photo of offending vehicleS and forwarding it to the council and highway authority.\n\nDAVID E TURNER\n\nUlverstone", "source": "Northwest Tasmania Advocate"}
