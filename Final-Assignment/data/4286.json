But they are fiercely opposed by the Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states who believe the group is bent on spreading Iran's influence. \n \nSince a Houthi missile attack killed at least 60 Gulf Arab troops east of Sanaa last Friday, the coalition has stepped up its air strikes on the capital and beefed up its deployment of troops, which Yemeni officials say number a few thousand, ahead of an eventual push towards Sanaa. \n \nFear is spreading that a decisive battle there may reek widespread destruction, as it has in the war-torn southern city of Taiz, where medics said 18 people were killed in an explosion on a residential area on Thursday variously blamed on Houthi artillery shelling and Saudi-led air strikes. \n \nMohammed Saleh, a Sanaa resident, said he wouldn't risk being pinned down as the bombing ramps up and soldiers advance. \n \n\"I've decided my family and I have to get out of Sanaa. There's nowhere left that's safe here, and neighborhoods are getting bombed every single day.\" \n \n(Reporting By Mohammed Ghobari; Writing by Noah Browning, editing by Sami Aboudi and Hugh Lawson)", "source": "Yahoo!
