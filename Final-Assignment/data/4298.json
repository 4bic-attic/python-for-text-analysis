Taberna\u2019s retention of the exchange fees was neither permitted by the CDOs\u2019 governing documents nor disclosed to investors in the CDOs. The fees rightfully belonged to the CDOs and created conflicts of interest that Taberna failed to disclose. \n\nThe SEC also charged Taberna\u2019s former managing director Michael Fralin and former chief operating officer Raphael Licht for their roles in certain aspects of Taberna\u2019s misconduct. \n\n\u201cCDO managers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their CDO clients and communicate fairly with them.

Instead, those fees belonged to the CDOs. \n\nTaberna obscured its misconduct by improperly labeling the exchange fees as \u201cthird party costs incurred\u201d in various documents.
