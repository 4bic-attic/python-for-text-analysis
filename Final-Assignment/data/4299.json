Video and accompanying audio of the stop clearly shows one of the officers calling Taylor, his then-girlfriend and his children a \u201cbunch of f****** n******.\u201d \n \nThat was after a one hour and 45-minute traffic stop in which police threatened to break the car\u2019s windows, use pepper spray and \u201cgrab them by the head\u201d to get the family out of the car. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll make up for it next time,\u201d another officer can be heard saying as he laughs. Only a speeding ticket was issued for the incident. \n \nThat led to just a three-day suspension for one of the officers and an out-of-court settlement with the village, according to CBS. \n \nFast forward to 2014, and Taylor alleges that the same officers retaliated against him. In dash cam video of the arrest last year, Taylor can be seen approaching police who are talking to his girlfriend and her son. \n \nJust six seconds after approaching police, Taylor is taken down to the ground, kicked in the head and allegedly called racial epithets. \n \n\u201cI had a tooth knocked out,\u201d Taylor told CBS . \u201cI had a bruise on the right side of my head.\u201d \n \nJudge Phillip G. Montgomery\u00a0agreed with Taylor and acquitted him of resisting arrest. \n \nNow Michael Schmiege, Taylor\u2019s lawyer, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Montgomery Police Department on behalf of his client, saying that the case is \u201ccrystal-clear retaliation.\u201d \n \nSchmiege told CBS that he thinks the Montgomery police officers didn\u2019t think they were being filmed. However, the incident was recorded by Kendall County police who were assisting on-scene. \n \nCBS reports that Taylor no longer lives in Montgomery.", "source": "Chicago Sun-Times"}
