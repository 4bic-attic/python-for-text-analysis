That's why I think it's so important that this story be told.\"\n\nHuang formed a partnership with Murphy then set about learning filmmaking, finding many similarities to his former career.\n\n\"With property development, you have to start with a good piece of land in a good location,\" he said. \"In filmmaking, you start with a good story.\n\n\"Then you hire an architect to draw a beautiful building. In filmmaking, you hire a writer to write a script.\n\n\"Once you have the architectural drawings, you hire a builder to translate the drawings into a physical building. In film, you hire a producer and director to translate the words into pictures.\n\n\"At the end, you hire an agent to sell your property and you hire a distributor to distribute your movie. The process is similar; the product is different.\"\n\nAs a rare \"angel\" investor in an Australian film, Huang is executive producer of Holding the Man.\n\nProducer Kylie Du Fresne, best known for The Sapphires, said financing what she describes as a medium-budget Australian film was surprisingly smooth because of Huang's contribution.\n\n\"Cameron was putting up almost the same amount of money that Screen Australia was,\" she said. \"It wasn't because he saw himself making a career as a film investor. It was because he believed in the material.\"\n\nWhile he wanted creative input on the script, casting and editing, Du Fresne said Huang was highly respectful of the filmmakers' expertise.\n\n\"He spent a lot of time on set just quietly watching from the back.\"\n\nWhile Huang concedes there is a chance he could lose all his investment, he believes the quality of the filmmaking team has minimised the risk. And the positive early response to the film has eased his nerves.\n\n\"You could play this story with a different disease \u2013 it could be cancer \u2013 and it's still a beautiful love story,\" he said. \"It just happens that instead of Romeo and Juliet, it's Romeo and Romeo.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "source": "Oberon Review"}
