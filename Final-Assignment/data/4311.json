According to him, it is incumbent on Ghanaians to rise up in 2016 and help the NPP rebuild a country, which has seen every aspect of her national economy in crisis. \u201cWe are talking about the situation where our country is down. Young people cannot get work to do, farmers do not have the inputs for their work, industries are closing all over the country, and our currency is now a joke. Every aspect of our national economy is in crisis,\u201d Akufo-Addo argued on his \u2018Rise and Build\u2019 tour in Wa. Nana Akufo-Addo added: \u201cYesterday, officially, we became HIPC again. The Bank of Ghana published statistics to show that the 70% benchmark of debt-to GDP ratio, which suggests whether you are HIPC or not, has been reached. We will reach 75% by the end of the year. Every aspect of our national economy is in crisis.\u201d He said an NPP government is Ghana\u2019s surest bet to return the country onto the path of progress and prosperity, a path which President John Agyekum Kufuor put Ghana onto before the NPP exited office in January 2009.", "source": "RSSMix.com Mix ID 8147465"}
