Dubbed Heart of Stone, this first proper expansion to the studio's massive fantasy RPG will launch on October 13. \n\nYou'll be able to hop in and enjoy the add-on content at any point in the campaign, but it's worth noting that the content is specifically tailored for those who have leveled up Geralt to at least 30. The expansion will take you to the wilds of No Man's Land, and is centered around a contract you make with a guy known as the Man of Glass. \n\nThe expansion content is expected to take players approximately 10 hours to complete and will set you back $10. Not too shabby, when you break it down. After all, more of The Witcher is never a bad thing. \n\nCD Projekt has a second expansion in the works\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
