They took me along with my mother but at some point we were separated. Since then, I\u2019ve not set my eyes on my mother. When he (Abu Kabir, my Boko Haram husband), wanted to marry me, he gave the women who were\u00a0 taking care of us N5,000 as my bride price.\n\u201cBefore the marriage, I was asked to convert to Islam. I did so because many who refused were killed and they gave me a name (Samira). I answered the name but I know my true name is my real name. When we were rescued I told the soldiers that my name is Tabitha.\n\u201cThey asked me if I am one of the wives of the Boko Haram and I told them my story. They felt for me and they treated me well.\n\u201cMany people asked me since we were liberated, particularly about the pregnancy. I don\u2019t know the right answer to give because I actually do not know what to do. It has happened. I don\u2019t know what the authorities would do about it but I think it is too late to abort it. But my prayer is that I give birth safely.\u201d \u00a0Culled from the Nation", "source": "Miss Petite Nigeria"}
