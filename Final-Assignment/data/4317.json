We're talking Bettie Page bangs, and considering Rita Ora is the fourth celebrity we've spotted with them in the past few weeks, we can safely say retro short fringe is a thing. Other sightings have been on Kim and Kourtney Kardashian at a photo shoot and on Taraji P. Henson. And the best news about bangs like these is that they're easy to get via a wiglet (like this one from classyrebel.com), so you don't even have to commit to them. But if you want to go for a real chop, keep mind that you should tread carefully if your face is very short and wide or very long and thin. For the far ends of the spectrum, a long face will just look longer and for short-faced ladies, your bangs will have to be so short to get air between your brows and your fringe that you may wind up looking like you have a nail brush glued to your forehead. Everyone else, go ahead and Bettie away. Want to know what's trending in beauty now? Check the Lipstick Index:\nPhoto by Getty Images", "source": "Girls in the Beauty Department"}
