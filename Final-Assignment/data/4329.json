On one level, it\u2019s an account of one boy\u2019s coming of age. More precisely, it\u2019s a tale of his coming to terms with his mother\u2019s disappearance, his father\u2019s crippling depression and his own sexuality, future and identity. \n \nOn another level, it\u2019s a swirl of mythology and collective memory, a jumble of times and places overlaid, like half-dreamt palimpsests, on one young man\u2019s circumscribed world. Palimpsest: that was the word that leapt most often into my mind as I delved into this account of the way tragedy reverberates across generations \u2014 an account whose emotional realism more than made up for its shortcomings in believability. \n\n\u201cStill Life,\u201d in short, is a book about remembering. Each chapter bears no title, only a character, a place and a time. The characters are threefold, fourfold if you count a future version of narrator Walter, who introduces each section. The places are circumscribed. The times, meanwhile, are as hazy and co-referential as memory itself: \u201cvery long ago,\u201d \u201clater,\u201d \u201cearlier\u201d being a few examples. \n\nThe story begins in Las Vegas, where we meet Walter. A high school senior, he\u2019s graduated early to support his severely depressed father (Owen) by guiding tours of kitschy dioramas displaying the city\u2019s history. He lives haunted by the disappearance of his mother, Emily, in that very city. Or rather, haunted by her disappearance post-suicide attempt, itself prompted by the death of her infant daughter. \n\n\u201cThe idea was, back then, that if I could eliminate all the characteristics that weren\u2019t her, I\u2019d arrive, eventually, at a picture of who she was.\u201d This is how Walter describes his childhood quest to find his mother. In lines like these (and there are a number of them), Sie deftly intertwines grieving with remembering. A presence is sketched (literally \u2014 artist Choi expertly renders Walter\u2019s drawings of his lost mother) by tracing an accumulation of absences around its edges. \n\nYet life pulls Walter onward; even as he comes to terms with his past, he must reckon with his future. As winter wears into spring, he finds himself pulled into a romance with Chrysto, an alluring Greek man who longs to escape a tragic past of his own. The relationship forces Walter to confront his future: a confrontation that demands he move beyond the losses that have thus far defined him. \n\nAll this to say: At rendering matters of grief and of memory, Sie and Choi are masterful. So too do they craft a gripping narrative. We learn of the tragedy itself only slowly, in images that bring it to life. Slower still do we discover that many of the stories Walter has lived with were half-invented. Instead, it is the memory \u2014 or rather, the act of making that memory \u2014 that readers are introduced to first. \n\nLaid out so explicitly in writing, all this stuff about memory and tragedy and narrative can seem precious. At times, this is true of Sie\u2019s book, too. By its concluding chapters, a less charitable reader might grow weary of the tragedy, endlessly repeated; or of Owen\u2019s depression, seemingly incurable. That reader will also encounter plot points that strain credulity: take, for instance, Chrysto\u2019s ability to stand still for hours on end for his job posing as a statue at a local casino. \n\nFor me, though? Walter\u2019s wry humor and Sie\u2019s emotional realism ensured a riveting read, if not an entirely realistic one. Racing through it felt like a dream \u2014 at times unpleasant, occasionally hard to believe, but always vivid and immersive. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \nMeredith Carroll, a 2015 Post-Gazette summer intern, is a senior at Grinnell College. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00a92015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \n\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nPHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194)", "source": "Lancaster Online"}
