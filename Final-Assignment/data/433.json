A weekly Central Bank survey of 100 economists on Tuesday said that further raising the rate would not help Brazil's steep economic slowdown.\n\nThe bank said the decision Wednesday by its monetary policy committee was unanimous.\n\nThe panel based its decision on an analysis of Brazil's macroeconomic situation, prospects for inflation and its current risk outlook, the bank said.\n\nThe world's seventh biggest economy is in a recession predicted to extend through 2016 and previous rate rises have not prevented a steady rise in inflation to the current 12-year high of 9.56 percent.\n\nThe 14.25 percent interest rate is already one of the highest in big economies.\n\nAnalysts believe the high interest rate will gradually bring down price rises, but that a new hike could be risky.\n\nThe real has lost more than a quarter of its value against the US dollar this year and there are fears for Brazil's investment grade credit rating after the government on Monday presented a 2016 budget that for the first time projects operating in the red.\n\nIn addition to the macroeconomic troubles, Brazil is being shaken by a political crisis with President Dilma Rousseff facing calls for her impeachment.", "source": "Yahoo!
