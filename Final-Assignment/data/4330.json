The Corporation for National and Community Service, which funds AmeriCorps programs and volunteers among other service work, is facing drastic cuts in both the House ( 34 percent ) and Senate ( 20 percent ) budget packages. \n \nSuch cuts would yank vital support from beneath some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people, Ashley Bembry-Kaintuck told a crowd Wednesday at the Center for American Progress. She recounted her experience with a fifth-grader named Renija in a Washington, D.C. elementary school, during her time volunteering with City Year. \n \n\u201cShe was such a smart little girl but had a lot of behavior problems\u201d that disrupted the whole class. Through close personal attention and open communication about the child\u2019s frustrations, Bembry-Kaintuck said, \u201cwe built trust one day at a time. After a few months with Renija, I saw her behavior change dramatically. If she had a problem she would come to me and explain why she was upset.\u201d Eventually all it took was a glance between the two of them, and Renija would refocus on her work instead of blowing up. Her grades improved along with her behavior. \n \nIt\u2019s a radically different outcome than is often the case for troubled young people of color in primary and secondary schools in America, where administrators are so quick to discipline that experts have described a \u201c school-to-prison pipeline \u201d developing in American public education. The possibility of drastic reductions to the already-meager stipends that make experiences like Renija\u2019s possible frighten Bembry-Kaintuck. \u201cThey mean less AmeriCorps members in our schools and communities, less support for fifth graders like Renija, less high school students who are college and career ready,\u201d she said. \n \nThe program has already been savaged by cuts in recent years, losing about a seventh of its funding from 2010 to 2013 before the 2014 deal restored less than half of what\u2019d been cut during the height of Tea Party budget fervor. Cutting CNCS is especially obtuse given both the size of the program \u2013 barely a billion dollars out of a budget measured in trillions \u2013 and the way community service programs return benefits to both the served and the servant. \n \n\u201cIt means less young people that have the opportunity to serve and find their career path like I did,\u201d Bembry-Kaintuck, who now uses many of the personal skills she developed in City Year in her video production career, said of the possible cuts. \n \nThat positive feedback loop in service work means that programs like City Year have what business-oriented folks like to call a \u201cdouble bottom-line.\u201d One such person is Jonathan Levine, a Bain Capital veteran who\u2019s passionate about the value of the work CNCS funds \u2013 and frustrated at how hard it already is to provide the support these programs need. \n \n\u201cIt is actually harder in the United States of America to get a slot in AmeriCorps and do national service than it is to get into many if not most competitive colleges in this country,\u201d Levine said Wednesday at CAP, on whose board of directors he serves. \u201cWe do not have a problem of apathy in this country. We have a problem of access.\u201d \n \nCity Year\u2019s slogan is simple: \u201cGive a year, change the world.\u201d But few people can afford to just give away a year of their life to a cause, no matter how deeply they believe in it. The cuts currently pending in Congress \u201cwould significantly reduce the number of positions AmeriCorps could fund and threaten the modest educational stipend that AmeriCorps workers receive after completing a year of public service work,\u201d the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes. \n \nService program funding has been a pawn in budget games before, as House Republicans have proposed to eliminate it entirely in recent years and the program survived a last-minute budget deal in 2014. All this comes despite broad bipartisan support for the concept of the CNCS, Levine said, pointing out that politicians from both parties showed up when the cameras were rolling for the signing of legislation to create the public corporation. \n \nThat reversal is evidence of more than just the standard elected official\u2019s hypocrisy between public words and legislative acts, former AmeriCorps director John Gompertz said Wednesday. It\u2019s an act of self-sabotage for a country where half of all public schoolchildren now live in poverty, and where non-profit service work of many other kinds is caught between high community demand and low resources to meet it. \n \n\u201cThe stories Ashley told, that\u2019s exactly what needs to happen for tons and tons of kids,\u201d Gompertz said, because many of them \u201chave not only a money poverty but a relationship poverty. It\u2019s not the absence of love, but the absence of people around them who can help navigate toward a brighter future.\u201d \n  Tags   AmeriCorps Budget Budget Cuts K-12 Education public service    \nThe post Lost In The Noise Of Budget Standoff, Funding For Volunteer Work Faces Huge Cuts appeared first on ThinkProgress .", "source": "ThinkProgress"}
