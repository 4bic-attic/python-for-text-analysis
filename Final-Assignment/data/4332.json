None of what\u2019s below is new. Many of you already know everything in here, but I feel like this is a good opportunity to review why our position is our position. I\u2019ll do my best to keep this simple and short. Just like all the world\u2019s best analysis! \n \nOver the last little while, I\u2019ve written a few things about Clutch . The specific stat might be difficult to explain to the average fan, but the idea is a basic one. Teams with high Clutch scores have had really good timing. Teams with low Clutch scores have had really bad timing. Timing is important! This explains a lot of the difference we see between actual wins and BaseRuns wins, which you can just think of as \u201cexpected wins.\u201d This year, the five most clutch teams in baseball so far have beaten their BaseRuns win total by a combined 45. The five least clutch teams in baseball so far have fallen short of their BaseRuns win total by a combined 43. It\u2019s hugely important, and this isn\u2019t a one-year phenomenon. \n \n\n \nI have BaseRuns information going back to 2002, so let\u2019s plot team Clutch score and the difference between actual wins and expected wins. This\u2019ll cover the completed seasons, between 2002 \u2013 2014. \n \n\n \nIt\u2019s clearly a strong relationship. Clutch doesn\u2019t explain everything , but it explains an awful lot, and that\u2019s just intuitive. Of course the teams that do the best at the right times will be more successful. If they do better than they usually do at the right times, they\u2019ll look like an over-achiever. That\u2019s how you can get a team to win more games than you\u2019d think just based on the overall statistics. \n \nClutch can turn a mediocre team into a playoff team. Clutch can also turn a would-be playoff team into a mediocre team. Because it\u2019s so important, it stands to reason teams would try to emphasize clutch performance, if they could. They\u2019d try to gather clutch performers. There\u2019s not a single analyst in the world who doubts the significance of clutch events. But that isn\u2019t the problem. Let me show you some more information. We\u2019ve got team batting Clutch, team starter Clutch, and team reliever Clutch. I decided to look at the window from between 2000 \u2013 2014, splitting seasons by first and second halves. Here\u2019s how batting Clutch has carried over, half to half: \n \n\n \nAn r-squared of literally 0.00. You can find numbers that aren\u2019t 0 if you go to more decimals, but that doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. It\u2019s a nothing relationship. Here\u2019s how starter Clutch has carried over, half to half: \n \n\n \nAn r-squared of literally 0.00. You get the point already, but let\u2019s move on to reliever Clutch: \n \n\n \nAn r-squared of literally 0.00. So this won\u2019t surprise you \u2014 putting it all together for team Clutch: \n \n\n \nAn r-squared of literally 0.00. No observed relationship. No observed hint of a relationship. The only relationship here is the one between Clutch and total randomness, and that\u2019s not a relationship for anyone to rely upon. It would be one thing if there were no relationship between Clutch in Year 1 and Year 2 (and there isn\u2019t). But this is looking at the same teams, within seasons. Even clutch teams are only temporarily clutch. Sometimes they remain clutch, but no less often do they do the opposite. \n \nThis is why I\u2019m more down on, say, the Twins than other people might be. Not that it matters at this point, with the season almost over, but there\u2019s trusting the Twins\u2019 record, and there\u2019s trusting the Twins\u2019 other, underlying numbers. The underlying numbers have proven more trustworthy. If you want to argue a certain team is innately clutch or unclutch, that\u2019s fine. Make the argument. You might very well be right. Just, understand what the argument is up against. Understand how hard it\u2019ll be to convince someone of legitimate clutchness. The argument against this stuff is strong, and it\u2019s tough to doubt a 0.00 r-squared. Factors you might think lend themselves to better or worse performance in clutch situations \u2014 there\u2019s nothing convincing in the recent history. And teams would have a lot to gain from harnessing this. \n \nThe position is one against clutchness, because that\u2019s what all the evidence points to. It\u2019s not coming out of stubbornness. It\u2019s not coming out of closed-mindedness. It\u2019s just that nothing else has been sufficiently convincing. And, this is important \u2014 analysts would probably love to be wrong! It would be amazing if real clutchness could be proven. That would be a breakthrough, and if you\u2019re just some person doing research, good research could get you hired by a club. It would be greatly significant if one could demonstrate reasons for under- or over-achieving, ahead of time. I think we\u2019d all love to read that article. It would change the way we see the game. \n \nThat just isn\u2019t where we are today. Today, it looks like near or total randomness. So it gets treated as such, and though the actual wins matter more than the expected wins do, as far as the World Series is concerned, one should understand why sometimes analysts think the expected wins are more meaningful, analytically. We\u2019re always trying to drown out the noise.", "source": "FanGraphs Baseball"}
