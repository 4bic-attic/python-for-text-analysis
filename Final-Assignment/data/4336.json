I thought I'd change things up a little this week for my post and talk about the changes I've noticed. \u00a0Some of them are pretty embarrassing but not quite as embarrassing as having a huge stomach, a big round moon face and being out of breath with the slightest amount of exercise. \u00a0I'm going to try and jog my memory so here goes... All of a sudden I can cross my legs again, I'm not really a \"cross my legs\" kinda gal but previously the tops of my thighs had been stopping me from getting the other one up and over. \u00a0See? \u00a0I told you they were embarrassing but it's the truth! \u00a0 I no longer analyse a chair to see if it will take my weight. \u00a0This is something I have done for so many years that I barely notice I did it but I don't bother now as I know I'm smaller, I also don't need to consider the width of a chair either. \u00a0 My ear lobes don't stick out. \u00a0This is another odd but mortifying one. \u00a0It had been brought to my attention that effectively I had ear lobes that stuck out and I just figured it was how I am. \u00a0Now I have lost so much weight they just hang like normal people's lobes because the fat in my cheeks don't push them out anyway. \u00a0I actually can't believe I'm writing this but... This is my weight loss diary effectively and this is my truth. I don't have to struggle to take a good selfie. \u00a0Now this isn't a vain one like it sounds but previously I would have to take the photo at a really high up angle to try and flatter my huge moon face. \u00a0Now I don't, if I do it lower down my face still looks slim but I have a little extra chin at the moment which I'm fine with for now! I walk with my head up. \u00a0I should have always walked with my head up but now I do and no longer staring at the floor. \u00a0I actually feel taller as a part of that. \u00a0 I can look at myself in the mirror. \u00a0I have grown so used to purposely not looking at reflections below my neck line because what I don't see won't upset me but then if I had\u00a0I may not have gotten into the state I got in. \u00a0It was only yesterday that I realised I can look into a full length mirror. \u00a0I don't have one of these in my home however I do in my home salon for hairdressing and I was almost shocked at the results that I saw. \u00a0 Clothes are literally falling off me. \u00a0It's sort of sad to see that some of my favourite clothes are too big now, it's okay as they represent an old me but it's a shame too. \u00a0 I'm also finding things that I have that were snug or didn't really even fit are fitting me which is fantastic. \u00a0 The distance I can walk now is incredible. \u00a0When I say I was unfit, I'm talking really severely out of shape. \u00a0I could probably manage a ten minute stroll and then my back and legs would seize up. \u00a0Now I've built myself up to do anything up to an hour and a half on my treadmill or evening walk and I know I could do longer without struggling at all or even being the slightest bit puffed. \u00a0The energy I have is unreal, it really is. I can see collarbones! \u00a0Only ever so slightly when I'm just stood straight. \u00a0It's nice to see a bit of definition and I'm sure more to come.\u00a0 I can catch a glimpse of them sometimes and it shocks\u00a0me as I haven't seen them in so long. This is actually my version of Nandos..! \u00a0 So let's get into the weigh in as this week was a big one.\u00a0 Last week I was one pound away from the next stone bracket down.\u00a0 This stone bracket was particularly significant as I'm now getting into a more regular persons weight.\u00a0 It's still heavy for my height but it's like I'm joining the world again with close to a more average size.\u00a0 I shall always tell the truth, I did a sneaky weigh in on Thursday and I had lost the weight I needed to be in the stone bracket below, I was completely ecstatic.\u00a0 For the next hour I actually just sat on my sofa in shock, and then the tears started as I sobbed at what I've achieved in just over four months.\u00a0 \u00a0 Fast forward to today for the actual weigh in and I just cant believe it, I've lost another 4lbs in total!\u00a0 It's actually 4lbs and a quarter but I'll count that off next weeks amount.\u00a0 I absolutely didn't expect to have two weeks running with such a big loss which was just the icing on the low calorie cake(!)\u00a0 This four 4lb loss brings me to a total of 3 stone 8lbs lost (50lbs!)\u00a0 At this point I have dropped around 3 or 4 dress sizes, it's hard to tell with different brands and styles but I can definitely fit some clothes that are four sizes smaller.\u00a0 I am also officially half way to wear I am going to be, that's such an exciting milestone to me.\u00a0 My clients comment virtually every time they see me, they say I look so small at my nail desk.\u00a0 My side profile is pretty decent now as well, wider than I want to be but that's okay.\u00a0 Next week I definitely don't expect a big loss but I'm excited to get going with it!\u00a0 If you want to lose weight, read this and believe you can do it like I am doing.\ufeff Every day we have a choice, it's a fresh start and the most important part from any healthy eating plan is to just try and make as many days, good ones. Losing a pound a week is still over three and a half stone in a year! If you're feeling particularly down about your weight, remember that if you stick to a balanced diet then by this time next week you could have dropped quite a few pounds, just the kick start you need to get going!\u00a0 Even just by cutting down on treats you could make a difference, how good would that feel?!
