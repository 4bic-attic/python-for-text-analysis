While doing so, an employee from Barnardo\u2019s Katie Dobson asked the defendant to do the banking and deposit the takings of \u00a3728.54 for them, along with completed banking slips. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\t\u201cThe defendant left at 11.50am and by 2pm he had not returned. He was called by Barnardo\u2019s and he later called back and said he had to do a few errands for his dad. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\t\u201cWhen he did return at 6pm, the defendant said he had lost \u00a342 of the money after it had fallen out of his pocket and promised to give it back the next day. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\t\u201cThe following morning, Katie Dobson noticed that the paying in slips had been amended and the matter was reported to police\u201d. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tPrice was later arrested and he admitted to taking the money. A search of his property revealed a betting receipt for \u00a3600 Coral Bookmakers. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tPrice, of Stringers Lane, Higher Kinnerton, Flintshire, told police he was in a constant cycle of gambling and said he got \u201ccarried away\u201d. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tHe admitted theft by his employee when he appeared before the Chester court on Tuesday. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tAdrian Evans, defending, said: \u201cAlthough this is in no way seeking to blame the lady at Barnardo\u2019s, Mr Price was surprised to have been given the takings to bank. The lady would not have known that Mr Price had a gambling problem for some time.\u201d \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tMr Evans said Price was remorseful over the incident which brought things to a head and Price was now seeking help from Gamblers Anonymous. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\t\u201cHe is doing his best to tackle his demons,\u201d said Mr Evans. \n \n\r \n\r\n\t\tMagistrates revoked the original community order and sentenced Price to a total of six months prison, suspended for 12 months. They also imposed a two-month electronic curfew and told Price to repay the \u00a3728.54 to Barnardo\u2019s, and a total of \u00a3345 costs.", "source": "NewsNorthWales.co.uk"}
