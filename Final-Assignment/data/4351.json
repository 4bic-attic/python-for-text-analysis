Early Sunday, the Warman RCMP were called to a business about a goat that wouldn't leave. Staff would walk him outside, but he would just turn back around and come through the automatic doors. Police believe he must have been cold and just wanted to stay somewhere warm. His owners were nowhere in sight and Animal Control said they don't typically deal with goats so he was transported to an animal hospital until his owners could be located. The goat is now safe and sound and back with his owners after his Saturday night on the town.", "source": "talkaboutguts.blogspot.com  ...."}
