She has adopted the \u201ctough-talk\u201d tactics of Andrew Cuomo and Merryl Tisch, apparently as cover for a governor and chancellor who have dramatically softened their education rhetoric to the public. Elia has labeled opt out parents as \u2018unreasonable\u2019, opt out supporting educators \u2018unethical\u2019 and threatened funding cuts if opt outs are not stopped.\n\n\nIn a press release yesterday expressing \u201csympathy\u201d for parents, Cuomo called for a review of the Common Core in New York, blaming the State Education Department\u2019s implementation while vowing to revive his Common Core panel to review the mess. \n\n\nParents across the state are not fools.  \n\nThey know the problems are hardly limited to implementation of the Common Core, but the actual Common Core itself, its excessive testing, and a fundamentally broken teacher evaluation system.  \nParents know that Andrew Cuomo is not part of the solution.  Cuomo is the problem.\n\n\nIt is Cuomo who forced his unproven teacher evaluation system down parents\u2019 throats. \n\nIt is Cuomo who slashed and underfunded the State Education Department staffing. \n \nIt is Cuomo who accepted \u2018Big Donor\u2019 campaign money and enabled the build-up of a privatized, unaccountable shadow government within the State Education Department \u2013The Regents Research Fellows\u2014who created the \u201cImplementation\u201d mess Cuomo now blames.\n\nIt is Cuomo who repeatedly tramples on the New York State Constitution--which gives a NY Governor NO authority over education policy\u2014with his serial habit of forming pro-corporate education reform stacked panels, complete with Washington lobbyists salivating to eliminate parental consent for data profiling of children.\n\n\nParents of New York are outraged and will continue the fight to take back their schools and classrooms from the Albany shenanigans of Andrew Cuomo, Merryl Tisch and MaryEllen Elia.\n\n\n \u201cIn New York, Governor Cuomo and Board of Regents Chancellor Merryl Tisch, teamed up for the past five years to turn theory and promise of the Common Core into a living nightmare for our children and their teachers. Parents see through the ploys and will not back down. We will continue to refuse to participate in the Common Core tests that are destroying our schools and our children's education. Governor Cuomo's role in this mess will not be ignored.\u201d  - Jeannette Deutermann, Long Island public school parent and Long Island Opt Out founder. \n\n\n \u201cThe spirit of our children is being broken. When will Albany start really paying attention and make the changes that parents are asking? We want our classrooms back, we want our teachers to teach, and we want a well-rounded curriculum for all our children. More test prep or testing is not the answer to closing the achievement gap.\u201d \u2013Charmaine Dixon, Brooklyn public school parent and NYC Opt Out member.\n\n\n \u201cParents will not stop fighting for their kids.  Tests MUST be decoupled from teacher evaluations, state tests MUST be reduced, and student data MUST NOT be shared without parental consent.\u201d \u2013Eric Mihelbergel, Western NY public school parent and NYSAPE founding member.\n\n\n \u201cThe corrupt influence of \u2018Big Money\u2019 and \u2018Big Data\u2019 Collection in New York has ushered in the most destructive education laws and policies in the nation based on model American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) legislation and \u201cpushed\u201d by the privatized Regent Research Fellows think tank.  Parents very clearly see how profit motives are driving the loss of local control in their children\u2019s classroom...and they reject it.\u201d  -Lisa Rudley, Westchester public school parent and NYSAPE founding member.\n\n\n\u201cThe results of the recent annual PDK/Gallup education poll are telling.  An overwhelming majority (64%) of Americans say there is too much emphasis on testing in schools and a majority of public school parents oppose the Common Core.  How much longer will parents in New York tolerate what Albany is doing to their children\u2019s classrooms?  The next election cycle will be very telling,\u201d said Jessica McNair, Central NY public school parent, educator, and CNY Opt Out founder. \n\n\nNYSAPE, a grassroots organization with over 50 parent and educator groups across the state are calling on parents to continue to opt out by refusing high-stakes testing starting on the first days of school.
