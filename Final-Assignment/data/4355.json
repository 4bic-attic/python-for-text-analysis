The AFT\u2019s own poll revealed 60 percent of its members are either Democrats or independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary elections. Nothing is said about the other 40 percent, who are only barely a minority. \n \nHas anyone asked the rank-and-file what they think about union politics? \n \nWhat do they think? The National Education Association, the other major teachers union, hints at the reason in its discussion of right-to-work laws: \n \nSome oppose unions for political reasons: unions tend to support Democrats over Republicans, because Democrat lawmakers tend to support the kinds of legislation like pension-protection laws and raising the minimum wage that are important to union leadership. \n \nI can\u2019t argue with anything there, but note that these left-wing issues are important to \u201cunion leadership.\u201d Is anyone asking the rank-and-file? What about union members who don\u2019t support union politics? There\u2019s a lawsuit\u00a0 now in Pennsylvania because\u00a0a Catholic teacher doesn\u2019t agree with her union\u2019s support of Planned Parenthood. The teacher wanted to send her money instead to a charity of her choice, and the negotiations were such a headache\u00a0that she filed a lawsuit. \n \nWhen Michigan passed its right-to-work law a few years ago \u2014\u00a0granting workers the right to choose whether to belong to a union, a move the AFT opposes \u2014 many teachers had a hard time getting out. I talked to two of them. Here\u2019s what one said: \n \n(Lisa) Jelenek and some of her co-workers chose not to re-join the union for the 2013-14 school year, the first year in which right-to-work applied. They didn\u2019t know about the August window until too late. \n \nJelenek tried in vain to leave the MEA before she retired. \n \n\u201cEarly September, we got an e-bill statement from the union treasurer, the dues statement for the year,\u201d Jelenek said. \u201cWe said, \u2018What? We\u2019re not joining.\u2019 We found it very convenient that we got it right at the beginning of September, when all the powers that be knew we had to do something in August.\u201d \n \nJelenek unwillingly remained a union member before retiring, but her former co-workers \u2014 about a third of her district\u2019s teachers \u2014\u00a0are still trying to leave the MEA. She didn\u2019t pay her dues as requested and has been ignoring her monthly billing statements. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what we were told initially by the unit director \u2014 If you don\u2019t pay this, we\u2019re going to send you to collections. We thought, \u2018You\u2019re representing me nicely,\u2019\u201d she said. \n \nRebecca Friedrichs, a California teacher, is technically not a member of a union, but she\u2019s still required to pay 70 percent of union dues \u2014\u00a0she gets a rebate for the 30 percent the union says it spends on political activities such as lobbying \u2014 even though she\u2019s lost almost all her member benefits. She\u2019s arguing in her lawsuit, which the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear, that the 70 percent she\u2019s paying is still being used politically, and therefore, she shouldn\u2019t be required to pay it. She\u2019s basing her argument on her First Amendment rights not to be forced to support political activity. She and fellow teacher Harlan Elrich\u00a0had bad experiences with their unions in California, according to their interview with the Washington Post . \n \nFriedrichs: Around 2006 and 2007, we\u2019d been having a lot of low morale issues in our district.\u00a0I decided to serve on my union\u2019s executive board\u00a0as secretary for our local. Every month, I would bring up the same question: The teachers I\u2019m representing and myself, we\u2019re concerned about a lot of the things going on with our union. We\u2019re concerned about tenure, we\u2019re forced to fund politics against our will.\u00a0Every time I would bring these things up I would just get shrugged shoulders from our union executive board. They wouldn\u2019t even give me a response. \n \nIn the interview, Friedrichs says the 70 percent she pays for collective bargaining isn\u2019t used to bargain for wages and benefits she asked for and agrees with. Why should she have to pay it? \n \nCertainly, many AFT members are happy to be AFT members, and they\u2019re welcome to post their opinions on social media \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s why social media exists.\u00a0But the AFT shouldn\u2019t pander to its members, many of whom can only choose between joining the union and leaving their jobs, and pretend they all support it. Some do, but many don\u2019t, and their voices deserve to be heard, too. \n \n\u00a0", "source": "Watchdog.org"}
