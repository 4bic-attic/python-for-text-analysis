The found\u00ading goals of the BDS move\u00adment and many of the strate\u00adgies employed in BDS cam\u00adpaigns are anti-Semitic.\u00a0 Such spon\u00adsor\u00adship cre\u00adates the per\u00adcep\u00adtion that spe\u00adcific uni\u00adver\u00adsity depart\u00adments sanc\u00adtion these goals and strate\u00adgies, lend\u00ading an added degree of legit\u00adi\u00admacy and cred\u00adi\u00adbil\u00adity to anti-Israel advo\u00adcacy and cam\u00adpaigns that may alien\u00adate Jew\u00adish and pro-Israel students. Since the 2012\u201313 aca\u00add\u00ade\u00admic year, there have been at least 99 anti-Israel events that received uni\u00adver\u00adsity depart\u00adment spon\u00adsor\u00adship, includ\u00ading 44 events which took place in the 2014\u201315 aca\u00add\u00ade\u00admic\u00a0year.

His pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtion, which dis\u00adcussed the role which he believes acad\u00ade\u00admia should play in BDS, was spon\u00adsored by the cam\u00adpus Stu\u00addents for Jus\u00adtice in Pales\u00adtine (SJP) chap\u00adter and co-sponsored by eight dif\u00adfer\u00adent Uni\u00adver\u00adsity depart\u00adments, includ\u00ading the Cen\u00adter for Race and Gen\u00adder, Asian Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Stud\u00adies, Native Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Stud\u00adies, Eth\u00adnic Stud\u00adies, Eng\u00adlish, Chi\u00adcano Stud\u00adies, Near East\u00adern Stud\u00adies, and African Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Studies. Bargh\u00adouti, a founder of the move\u00adment who recently stated that he believes BDS is turn\u00ading main\u00adstream, has used Holo\u00adcaust imagery to con\u00addemn Israel and its sup\u00adport\u00aders in past pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtions and inter\u00adviews. He also has advo\u00adcated for a one-state solu\u00adtion to the Israeli-Palestinian con\u00adflict, along with the right of return for Pales\u00adtin\u00adian refugees, claim\u00ading that one state would mean \u201cequal\u00adity for everyone\u2013irrespective of iden\u00adtity, eth\u00adnic\u00adity, reli\u00adgion or any other attribute.\u201d Barghouti\u2019s event is not unique for this year though, as the Cen\u00adter for Diver\u00adsity and Inclu\u00adsion at Michi\u00adgan Tech\u00adno\u00adlog\u00adi\u00adcal Uni\u00adver\u00adsity spon\u00adsored a sim\u00adi\u00adlar pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtion from Israeli anti-Zionist author Miko Peled on Sep\u00adtem\u00adber 15, 2015. Over the years, Peled has made sev\u00aderal state\u00adments about Jews, Israel, and the Israeli-Palestinian con\u00adflict that would not define \u201cinclu\u00adsion\u201d or \u201cdiver\u00adsity.\u201d These state\u00adments include his alle\u00adga\u00adtion that Israel turned Gaza into an \u201cenor\u00admous con\u00adcen\u00adtra\u00adtion camp\u201d or more recently, when he stated that \u201cnei\u00adther Iran, Hezbol\u00adlah or Hamas pose a threat to Israel, they pose a threat to the Israeli occu\u00adpa\u00adtion and oppres\u00adsion of Palestinians.\u201d Other events which received depart\u00adment spon\u00adsor\u00adship this year include an upcom\u00ading per\u00adfor\u00admance by Remi Kanazi, an Orga\u00adniz\u00ading Com\u00admit\u00adtee mem\u00adber of the US Cam\u00adpaign for the Aca\u00add\u00ade\u00admic & Cul\u00adtural Boy\u00adcott of Israel (USACBI), at John Jay Col\u00adlege. At John Jay, Kanazi\u2019s per\u00adfor\u00admance is being co-sponsored by the Depart\u00adment of Gen\u00adder Studies. In addi\u00adtion, a Sep\u00adtem\u00adber 16 pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtion at Drew Uni\u00adver\u00adsity by Bassem Tamimi, a Pales\u00adtin\u00adian anti-Israel activist who has been arrested in Israel sev\u00aderal times, was co-sponsored by the Mid\u00addle East Stud\u00adies Depart\u00adment; and a pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtion from Vijay Prashad, the for\u00admer Edward Said chair in Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Stud\u00adies at the Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Uni\u00adver\u00adsity of Beirut, was co-sponsored by the Ethics, Peace, and Global Affairs Program. While not all advo\u00adcates of BDS are anti-Semitic and may be dri\u00adven by per\u00adceived legit\u00adi\u00admate crit\u00adi\u00adcism of cer\u00adtain Israeli poli\u00adcies toward Pales\u00adtini\u00adans, many indi\u00advid\u00adu\u00adals engaged in BDS cam\u00adpaigns are dri\u00adven by oppo\u00adsi\u00adtion to Israel\u2019s very exis\u00adtence as a Jew\u00adish state. Because of this, it\u2019s unfor\u00adtu\u00adnate that uni\u00adver\u00adsity depart\u00adments would lend their spon\u00adsor\u00adship to events that can cre\u00adate an envi\u00adron\u00adment that is hos\u00adtile to Jew\u00adish and pro-Israel students.", "source": "ADL Blogs"}
