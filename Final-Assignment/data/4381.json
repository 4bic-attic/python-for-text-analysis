They didn\u2019t rule on whether or not the argument had any merit.\u201d \n \nAmerican Nuclear Society retired nuclear engineer and consultant Howard Shaffer explains there are two separate streams of money \u2013 the decommissioning and the spent fuel storage funds \u2014 that are getting tangled in this argument.\u00a0 \u201cIn the case of Vermont Yankee, which is a merchant generator as opposed to a utility where there are other owners and ratepayers that could provide additional funds if money ran out, the really only immediately available money is the decommissioning fund and the state is concerned that that might run out before the plant is decommissioned.\u201d \n \nNew England Coalition Trustee Clay Turnbull says Entergy chose not to move the fuel into casks while the plant was in operation, where it would have been an operating cost.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor Entergy to avoid paying the spent fuel management costs out of their own accounts to move that fuel, Entergy has asked the NRC for an exception to the rule that says the money in the decommissioning fund can only be used for decommissioning. So the only reason that the two get mixed up is that Entergy has requested permission to use the decommissioning money for the spent fuel.\u201d \n \nCitizens\u2019 Awareness Network Executive Director Deb Katz believes the NRC would violate its own regulations if it allows Entergy to use money that is not for radiological cleanup.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is a terrible precedent and the only reason it\u2019s happening is because Entergy is a merchant plant.\u00a0 It has no rate base to go back to.\u00a0 And even though the corporation, the parent corporation Entergy, said if there was a shortfall they\u2019d come through with the money to ensure Entergy\u2019s operation whether it was operation or cleanup.\u00a0 And instead they\u2019re basically reneging on the deal.\u201d \n \nEntergy estimates it will cost $817 million to decommission the plant and $57 million for site restoration.", "source": "WAMC.org"}
