He now lives in France under tight security. \n \nForeign Minister Laurent Fabius said France had a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to take action. \n \n\u201cFaced with these crimes that offend the human conscience, this bureaucracy of horror, faced with this denial of the values of humanity, it is our responsibility to act against the impunity of the killers,\u201d Fabius said in a statement. \n \nHe said the \u201cthousands of unbearable photos, authenticated by many experts, which show corpses tortured and starved to death in the prisons of the regime, demonstrate the systematic cruelty of the Assad regime\u201d. \n \nThe inquiry will be led by France\u2019s war crimes body. \n \nThe judicial source said the term \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d was used to include kidnappings and torture by the regime in the probe. \n \nThe Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) welcomed the announcement, saying the investigation was \u201ca world first\u201d. \n \nWhile Assad is unlikely to ever stand trial in a French court, the inquiry could add to political pressure on the Syrian leader in the midst of a diplomatic row between the West and Russia and Iran over his fate. \n \nThe Syrian conflict has taken centre stage at the UN General Assembly in New York, where US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin clashed over how to bring an end to Syria\u2019s civil war. \n \n\u2013 \u2018Assad\u2019s secret killings\u2019 \u2013 \n \nOn Tuesday, Obama said removing Assad was a vital step to defeating Islamic State jihadists who have taken advantage of the chaos in Syria to bring large parts of the country and neighbouring Iraq under its rule. \n \nFrench President Francois Hollande echoed Obama\u2019s call in his UN speech, but Putin \u2014 a long-time Assad ally \u2014 dismissed their pleas, saying they \u201cshould not be involved in choosing the leadership of another country\u201d. \n \nSyria\u2019s four-year war has killed more than 240,000 people and Western diplomats have accused Assad\u2019s regime of killing more of their own people than the Islamic State group by dropping barrel bombs \u2014 charges the government denies. \n \nThe brutal conflict has also displaced millions of people, a key driver behind Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. \n \nThe photographs that Caesar brought out of Syria show people with their eyes gouged out, emaciated bodies, people with wounds on the back or stomach, and also a picture of hundreds of corpses lying in a shed surrounded by plastic bags used for burials. \n \nEntitled \u201cAssad\u2019s secret killings,\u201d the dossier is being used by international bodies including the UN as part of an investigation into the regime\u2019s role in \u201cmass torture\u201d. \n \nThe Syrian government has branded the report \u201cpolitical\u201d. \n \nCeasar said in an interview with French magazine L\u2019Obs released Wednesday that he wanted to \u201cshow the real face of Bashar al-Assad \u2014 that of a dictator who has caused a lot of blood to flow\u201d. \n \nFabius said the opening of the French probe should not prevent the United Nations and particularly its International Commission of Inquiry on Syria to press on with their own investigations. \n \nThe post France opens probe into Assad regime for crimes against humanity appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria .", "source": "The Guardian Nigeria"}
