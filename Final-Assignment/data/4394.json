Tracy Reese played on that sense of elation and good cheer for her Spring 2016 collection which was downright pretty, chock full of girlishness, shimmer, and sheer detailing for a flash of skin. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nWe all know that florals for Spring aren\u2019t groundbreaking (thanks Miranda Priestly), but they felt fresh here on an easy off-the-shoulder dress, leggy mini frock paired with a studded yellow coat and black sheer tights, a bold maxi number layered under a cropped leather biker jacket, and an easy camisole given added flair with a lace sheer blouse and easy rust trousers. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLace overlays injected a dose of old school femininity to a glamorous sequin slipdress, a roomy printed coat, lime green bralette for a pop of color, and relaxed pants. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSeparates made a huge impact with button-accented tops, flirty knee-length skirts, and printed jacket and trouser combinations that played on the pajama trend. The shoes were also a focal point of the looks\u2014 designed in collaboration with Sarah Jessica Parker. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nReese is best known for her dresses and there were some FLOTUS-worthy frocks in the collection. A printed short-sleeve crepe dress was pleasant and would work with the assortment\u2019s icy blue booties or sneakers, while a white lace fishtail gown was one step away from bridal-perfect, save for its sheerness. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMy favorite pieces on display were those that were simple in silhouette, but adventurous in color. A copper caped playsuit is standout enough to last in a modern-day woman\u2019s wardrobe for years to come and a silver biker jacket will inject a rocker chic edge to everything from menswear-inspired suiting to the most prim and proper sheath. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nWhat do you think of Tracy Reese\u2019s Spring collection? \n \nImages: VOGUE.com \n \nThe post Show Review: Tracy Reese Spring 2016 appeared first on The Fashion Bomb Blog : Celebrity Fashion, Fashion News, What To Wear, Runway Show Reviews . \n  Wait!
