Carmel are still dealing with the loss of their head soccer coach. Coach Alan Shepherd passed away on Friday, August 21 but his legacy and love for soccer will never be forgotten. Kapaun played their first soccer game of the season Tuesday night. Before the game started, a small tribute to Coach Shepherd took place where his family received flowers and a prayer was recited. \"His passing will be an incentive for these young men playing soccer...to the best of their abilities because they would have done it for Shep anyway,\" said Shepherds former colleague Kevin Arkins. The stands were unusually crowded with students; they were chanting their respect for Coach Shepherd throughout the game. \"I don't ever remember seeing a crowd this big and that into the game than we had tonight,\" said now head coach Anthony Cantele. \"There are a lot of different emotions that go throughout tonight...but I couldn't be any more proud of of the kids for how they handled everything,\" Cantele said with a noticeable quiver in his voice. Kapaun defeated the Derby High School soccer team with a score 3-to-1.", "source": "KAKE - HomePage - Headlines"}
