People can judge me at the end of the season and we will go from there. I have to stay focused but it is great to score. \n \n\"When you score like last season it becomes a drug, and when someone takes it away from you, you want to get it back. You want to score again and it was a good feeling to score again. \n \n\"It is frustrating (to be criticised). I kind of use it to get my juices flowing and to prove these people wrong. I have had to prove people wrong throughout my career to get where I am,\" he added. \n \n\"It is not easy coming through as a youngster but it makes me want to get better and the more people say it, the more I want to prove them wrong.\" \n \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)", "source": "Yahoo!
