According to him, the central bank is working hard to set up offices across all regional capitals in the country. \n \n\u201cI think that the responsibility for regulating the financial system is actually a statutory on and it has been given to the bank of Ghana and we cannot move away from that responsibility, the law clearly mandates the bank of Ghana to do that but yes probably we could set up offices in all the regional capitals, may be centre to look at these issues and that is something that management is seriously considering but for now I think we are gradually putting up the structures to sort of ensure that we are almost everywhere to monitor and regulate the microfinance sector.\u201d \n \nSource: Citifmonline \n   Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!
