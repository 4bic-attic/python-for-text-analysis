Even then, he undertook the trip to his native Qubani in Syria to bury the sons in their homeland. \n \nReading the touching anecdote reminded me of a Jewish dad who was about to give up his only one son, not because of migrant escapade, but under God-honouring compulsion. \n \nBut, in the nick of time, this lad\u2019s life was spared. \n \nThis mobile and migrant dad was Abraham, the affluent patriarch who had his priorities straight. \n \nAbraham\u2019s prosperity didn\u2019t take him away from God to look for safer and secure pastures in far-off lands. \n \nEvery time he moved and pitched his tent, he also built an altar to the One under whose direction he was voyaging. \n \nTalking about his nomadic life, the writer of the Book of Hebrews says: \u201cBecause he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\u201d \n \nAbraham sought a new world, more stable and much more eternal than Western Europe or North American shores, as his family\u2019s permanent refuge. \n \nOne day a test came to him when God told him: \u201cTake thy son and offer a sacrifice of him.\u201d \n \nAnd, as if to rub into him precisely what He was asking, God added: \u201cThine only son, Isaac.\u201d \n \nThat name reminded Abraham of his son of promise. \n \nGod had promised that through Isaac the world would be blest some day and the redeemer of mankind would come in his line. \n \nGod said to Abraham,: \u201cMake an offering out of him. I am not asking you just to take him up on top of a mountain and stab him to death. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to do it as a religious act of devotion, of worship, of adoration, of love towards me. \n \n\u201cIt has to be a religious exercise. You are to make a real service out of it with the right attitude of heart.\u201d \n \nThe Bible tells us that when Abraham heard that, the very next morning he started on his way. \n \nThat\u2019s how quick he was to obey God. \n \nGod came before his family and before his children. \n \nIf the meaning of that is properly understood, it won\u2019t bring problems; it would only bring blessings to our families and our children. \n \nSo, Abraham went up to that mountain, without wavering. \n \nAnd what had God promised? \n \nIt\u2019s that through the son who was about to be sacrificed, the whole world was going to be blessed. Jesus was going to come down in his line. \n \nNow comes this paradoxical, contradictory command in which God said: \u201cPut him on an altar and make him an offering.\u201d \n \nWithout hesitation, Abraham went up to the mountain where this was to take place. \n \nHebrews , chapter 11, gives a beautiful insight into this story where it says: \u201cBy faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac . . . accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead.\u201d \n \nDo we get the picture? \n \nThe late V. Raymond Edman , president of Wheaton College, used to say: \u201cNever doubt in the dark what God has promised you in the light.\u201d \n \nIn the light, God said: \u201cAbraham, Isaac is the man through whom the Messiah would come into the world.\u201d \n \nAnd, when darkness came, Abraham held on to that promise and must have said: \u201cDear God, I believe you. \n \n\u201cAnd I take my son up there and you allow me to take his life. You are going to have to raise him from the dead because I am holding you to your word.\u201d \n \nHow\u2019s that for real faith? \n \nAbraham had his priorities straight: God first \n \nNot like Eli, the high priest, the sweet old man who helped Samuel find the Lord. \n \nGod told him one time: \u201cEli, you prefer your sons above me because, when they do evil, you don\u2019t restrain them.\u201d \n \nEli\u2019s sons, who were also priests, were tampering with offerings of the temple. This was a serious offence because those offerings pre-pictured Christ\u2019s sacrifice on the cross. \n \nThe boys tampered with offerings of the Lord and, beyond that, they committed immorality with women worshippers in the precinct of God\u2019s temple. \n \nAnd, instead of tearing their priestly robes off, all Eli would say was: \u201cNaughty, naughty. Daddy wishes you won\u2019t do that.\u201d \n \nEli\u2019s priorities were mixed up. God said: \u201cYou prefer your sons above me.\u201d \n \nFathers, grandpas, let us remind ourselves we are the priests of the families we represent. \n \nAnd, it\u2019s our job to raise children and grandchildren as His followers no matter what the cost may be. \n \nKTW welcomes\u00a0 submissions to its Faith page.
