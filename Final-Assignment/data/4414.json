However the cabinet today discussed and agreed the ambassador had no intention to interfere in domestic affairs. \n\nAccording to a Sin Chew Daily report, the cabinet also agreed to put the matter to rest. \n\nAlthough the issue had gained much attention internationally, the cabinet opined it had not affected the bilateral relationship between China and Malaysia. \n\nThe cabinet also opined that certain quarters misinterpreted the ambassador's remarks and took them out of context, which then became viral in social media and created misunderstandings. \n\nThe Sin Chew Daily quoted Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department Wee Ka Siong ( photo ) that MCA ministers had explained the matter to the cabinet - that the ambassador had never mentioned 'Malaysian Chinese' in his remarks, which were twisted by certain quarters. \n\nHe added that Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid will represent the government, which will release a statement to close the issue. \n\n\"Those people who have a poor command of the Chinese language, in translating the original speech, misinterpreted the ambassador's remark; he had never used the word Malaysian Chinese.\" \n\nWee further clarified it was also mentioned in the cabinet that Wisma Putra didn't summon Huang, but just called him in to ask him to explain if his remarks at Petaling Street had been misconstrued or not.", "source": "Malaysiakini"}
