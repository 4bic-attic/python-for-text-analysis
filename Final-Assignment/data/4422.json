But it\\'s not really on my mind.", "id": "6b428a3a-a584-4ac7-a45f-46364ef6e3ab", "content": "Whitney Archer \n\r\nThe last time someone reminded me I have cancer was at a funeral. A woman I barely knew walked up to me, arms open wide. \u201cWhitney, you look so good!\u201d she said, fawning over me and assuring me that I was on her church\u2019s prayer chain. \n\r\nI stood there, blinking and drawing a blank. What was she talking about? \n\r\nThen I remembered: Oh yeah, I have brain cancer. I carry a malignant tumor around everywhere I go. I\u2019m 31 years old and have had brain cancer for five years. The doctors say I might live two years or 18. They have no idea. It\u2019s entirely possible I will die of something else before my tumor kills me. Maybe. \n\r\nAs medical advances and oncological therapies continue to progress, more cancer patients are living longer, even somewhat normal lives. More people are discovering that their diagnoses may not lead to an eventual cure or a death sentence, but an unknown future for their lives and their diseases. We\u2019re on a third path: We have cancer, but we\u2019re mostly okay. For us, cancer begins with a traumatizing diagnosis but eventually becomes a regular part of life, with the occasional MRI squeezed in between kids\u2019 birthday parties and dental appointments. And soon we realize that, not unlike asthma or diabetes, cancer can be a chronic condition. As time passes, a slow-learned truth begins to reveal itself: It is possible to live and die at the same time. \n\r\nI sit in the MRI waiting room next to a woman in a wheelchair. Her torso and arms are covered in a black, fuzzy blanket. She stirs when her husband gives her over-the-counter pain medication, and I catch a glimpse of her limbs: bird-like, with sagging skin. Her slim knit turban overstates the obvious. She\u2019s a cancer patient. \n\r\nWe\u2019re both here for the same reason: to see if we are losing the so-called fight. I know from the worn-out hospital bag, the refusal to take off her metallic earrings until the last second, the bleariness, that her story has more treatments, more suffering. \n\r\nI forget that I\u2019m a member of this club. Despite the cancerous tumor, called an astrocytoma, in my brain, I\u2019m the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I have no visible scars, no baldness. I weigh 15 pounds too much. I go to work, save money, chase my red-headed son. I eat too much junk food and do penance with organic salad. But every four months, my butt is in that MRI waiting room, surrounded by people who are dying. \n\r\nIt was a fluke, a mistake that they found the tumor at all. An over-the-counter medication for vertigo would have stopped my headaches, but an overly cautious doctor saved my life. The tumor was partially removed, but 60 percent of it remains. It just sits there, causing no headaches or seizures but forcing a new life on my family. \n\r\nToday I\u2019m a cancer patient again, heading back to Exam Room No. 2. A cute technician (normally, I would appreciate this detail, but when he\u2019s staring at my brain tumor for an hour, it\u2019s slightly awkward) hands me earplugs and industrial woodshop-style headphones. \n\r\nHe lowers a metal cage over my head and inserts foam wedges in any leftover spaces. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d the technician chirps as he hands me a panic button. Then the barrage of sounds begins. It goes like this: A crazy person forces me into a plastic barrel, which is then shoved into a metal one. Then, an army of lightsaber-bearing toddlers attacks. Zing! Next, a horde of crazed bees stings in perfect synchronization. Zap! Zap! The whole thing is sent down a waterfall, then surprised by a rib-jarring bear attack. The world\u2019s biggest spring is bounced off the top, over and over. Boing! This goes on for an hour. Just as I\u2019m about to scream, there is silence. \n\r\nDespite the actual test, I enjoy MRI days. They mean a day off work for me and my husband. We drop Nate off at school and brave rush-hour traffic to drive north to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Breakfast in hand, we happily chat in the car, not about work and not about doctors. How many times have we done this? Fifteen? Twenty? \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, right?\u201d I ask. He assures me that yes, this scan too will be good. It always is. \n\r\nThe second a doctor walks into the exam room, she shakes my hand and says, \u201cYour scans are fine.\u201d They always are. \n\r\nCancer is as much a part of my life as the carpool line and grocery shopping; close friends are used to my casual references. They\u2019ll even tease me about playing the tumor card for the last slice of pizza. But sometimes I forget that most people think of cancer as the last stop before imminent death. I\u2019ll look up and notice everyone else standing there, shocked that I mentioned the C word over beers and chips. I\u2019m a total hit at parties. \n\r\nWhile admiring some low-priced Swedish object at IKEA a couple of years ago, I turned to my friend. \u201cOh, I need that like I need a hole in my head,\u201d I quipped. It took three seconds for us to realize how that line no longer applied. There we were, two grown women in the kids\u2019 section, bent over in gusts of laughter and tears next to the LILLABOs and the DUKTIGs. \n\r\nAfter my surgery, I spent two years holding my breath, waiting for the next MRI to show growth, for me to sit on the crinkly-papered patient bed and listen to bad news. But it didn\u2019t happen. And slowly, minutely, I began to live more and to realize that I felt, well, healthy. \n\r\nI have received no treatment other than surgery, and there were no complications. I have no side effects. There is only a scar underneath my hair. The doctors ask me if I have tremors or have lost any speech. No, I say, and go back to my reading. You\u2019re not taking any medication, they marvel. I\u2019m checking Instagram. \n\r\nFinally, the doctors sigh, \u201cGo live your life.\u201d \n\r\nYears of visits have taught me that they don\u2019t say much. They can\u2019t tell me how long I have, what treatments will work in the future, whether I will develop seizures. I have begged the nation\u2019s best oncologists for information, details. But they all shake their heads. They don\u2019t know. \n\r\n\u201cNobody knows the future,\u201d one told me. Funny, that\u2019s what my mother said. \n\r\nAnd that\u2019s just it. Last year, one of my son\u2019s first-grade friends lost her father to terminal cancer. \u201cWhy do people get cancer?\u201d he asked from the back seat of our Corolla. I waited, terrified, for him to connect that outcome and mine. But he never did. \u201cCancer makes people die,\u201d he concluded, and I tried to explain that no, not always. Some of us live. \n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult for some people to understand that I\u2019m not cured and I\u2019m not dying. Like my son, many seem to have a binary understanding of this universally feared disease \u2014 either you\u2019re cancer-free, or you\u2019re Stage 4 and at death\u2019s door. \n\r\nIf cancer has taught me anything, it\u2019s that how we talk about something informs how we see it. Susan Sontag famously wrote in 1978 about how military terminology is used, wrongly, to discuss illness. With increased survival rates since her own diagnosis, and more people simply living with cancer rather than \u201cbattling\u201d it, the metaphor is even less helpful. But the vocabulary persists: Cancer is an invasion; patients wage war against an army of rapidly multiplying cells. The words don\u2019t square with my experience. How am I a conqueror if I\u2019m both sick and healthy? How can I stop an invasion when my disease isn\u2019t on the attack but lying in wait? And if cancer devours my mind, is it because I was a poor general? \n\r\nmy diagnosis, the only metaphor that made any sense was dual citizenship: belonging to both the world of the hale and hearty and the land of death and despair. I may not be fighting for each new day, each new breath, but I\u2019m something of an expatriate from my former life. You could say that I was shanghaied from health five years ago in a cold hospital room in Manassas, Va. Those of us who have been transported step back and forth, with different degrees of agility, between this world and that of illness, while we strive for a regular life. I nearly lost the chance to watch my son learn to read, to go to work five days a week, to paint my bedroom Dew Drop. I revel in normalcy. I haven\u2019t conquered a damn thing. \n\r\nBut being a cancer patient means inevitable loss. I\u2019m more impatient than ever. My son mentioned me being a grandma, and I realized that I don\u2019t picture myself growing old anymore. My timeline has inexorably shrunk to the next MRI and, if I\u2019m being optimistic, next year. Despite my present health, the future holds both hope and terror. \n\r\nThe night before an MRI, I usually find myself in my holey pajamas, crying over work, over something stupid. What\u2019s going on, I wail to my husband. Why do I just want to eat junk food? What kind of mother am I? He reminds me that I am allowed to grieve again and again, that if I feel down for three 48-hour periods every year and that\u2019s as bad as it gets, I\u2019m one of the luckiest ones. He buys me chocolate and pizza. \n\r\nMy son begs for a sibling, but for now, I can\u2019t offer an alternative other than stuffed animals and best friends. Medical research suggests, ever so slightly, that for someone with my medical history, a pregnancy could be fatal. I feel no guilt, no wavering in my decision. \n\r\nStill, there are nights when I watch my son sleep, snoring while classical music plays quietly. Those are the nights I wish I could watch other children sleeping beside him, watch my grandchildren decades from now, and be amazed at the stillness and silence. And standing there, in between the light of the hallway and the shadows of the bedroom, the sorrow comes back, sitting on my chest, and I can\u2019t breathe. \n\r\n\u2014 Washington Post", "source": "Frontier Post"}
