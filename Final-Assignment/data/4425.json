They had the Panthers pinned on their seven-yard-line and stopped them on third down. The Panthers would be forced to punt from their own end zone \u2014 until the officials announced the Jaguars had called time out just before the previous snap and the Panthers would get another play on third-and-10. Carolina took advantage. Cam Newton then threw a 10-yard pass to Jerricho Cotchery, who fought through two tacklers for a first down. \u201cWe tried to switch personnel. That one was on us,\u2019\u2019 said Jaguars coach Gus Bradley. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it off fast enough, we called a time out and they converted on that one and kept it going. But we had other opportunities there with a couple of missed tackles that could have gotten us out of that drive.\u2019\u2019 Linebacker Dan Skuta was in the process off running the field, leaving the Jaguars with 10 men, prompting the time out. The Panthers would get three more first downs on the drive, twice converting on third down, before Graham Gano kicked a 47-yard field goal with 2:41 left. The drive took 8:07 off the clock. And it gave the Panthers a 20-9 lead and a two-score margin. And when Blake Bortles threw his second interception of the game on the next possession, that would be the final score. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those things. You almost wish you just let them play the third down and we would have gotten off the field,\u2019\u2019 Jaguars linebacker Paul Posluszny said of the timeout. \u201cThat stuff happens.\u2019\u2019 Posluszny, though, was frustrated the Jaguars defense allowed the Panthers to extend the drive into a 15-play marathon. Aside from that 64-yard march, the defense allowed the Panthers only 199 yards of offense. It was a methodical drive \u2014 the Panthers didn\u2019t have a play that gained more than 12 yards. Newton completed three passes and ran four times. \u201cYou say, \u2019OK, it\u2019s time to move onto the next play when something like that happens,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Pozluszny said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that bother us moving forward. It happens. Now it\u2019s time go on to the next play. That\u2019s the disappointing thing about that drive.\u2019\u2019 Veteran Chris Clemons, who had a sack, batted down a pass and blocked a field goal attempt, said: \u201cThere were a few things that happened during the course of that drive. \u201cThey broke the huddle with 12 men and we don\u2019t complain about that. It won\u2019t mean anything if the refs don\u2019t call it.\u2019\u2019 But Clemons added, \u201cThey executed the plays they needed, got the first downs they needed and ran the clock.\u2019\u2019 \u00a0 Vito Stellino: (904) 359-4279", "source": "Jacksonville's Most Recent Headlines - Jacksonville.com and The Florida Times-Union"}
