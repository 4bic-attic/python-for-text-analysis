One of the big pieces injured my two legs, cutting through to my nerves. It also hit my head and my hands\u201d, said Al Hajri. \n\nSome pilgrims helped Al Hajri as he couldn\u2019t move or walk, by taking him to a safer place. \n\n\u201cWhat I remembered was that I saw a man whose body was cut into two parts after the large part of the crane fell on him\u201d, said Al Hajri. \n\nAl Wahaibi sustained an electric shock due to the wires that were cut when the crane collapsed. He jumped on other pilgrims to avoid electrocution and escaped with a fractured leg. \n\nAl Hajri added that the ambulance arrived at the scene 30 minutes after the crane fell. \n\nSalim and Ali underwent medical treatment at a Makkah health centre and were discharged after seven hours.\n\nThey thanked the Saudi authorities and the Omani Haj mission for the help they provided for them.\n\nThey also appealed to the mission to provide them with a vehicle as they cannot walk due to their injuries.\n\nBy Fahad Al Mukrashi, Correspondent\n\nGulf News 2015.
