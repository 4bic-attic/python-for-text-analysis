He seems to remember it very well, and quite often too. Friends often write in to tell us how he digresses, as is his wont, to say, \u201cWhen I was in India\u2026\u201d He did that, for instance, in February 2013 in Heidelberg , when in the middle of his ingenious thoughts on Hegel, Marx, Capitalism and Democracy, he spoke of his new hero: Ambedkar. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHe did this again at a public lecture delivered at the Institute of Public Affairs in LSE in November 2014. Ten minutes into the talk, \u201cThe Need to Censor our Dreams\u201d , he mounted an attack on \u201cthe brahmin cultural studies people\u201d who do not shy away even from glorifying the Hindu caste system and discount its critics for their Western imperialist perspective. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u017di\u017eek jovially denounced the postcolonial critique of \u201cWestern cultural values\u201d for their pretension to be universal. For, he claimed, it has become commonplace to decry egalitarianism, freedom, the welfare state, \u201cand so on\u201d as these words had become emptied of meaning in the cavernous mouths of Western powers trying to gobble up the world in one gulp. And the fortification of Fortress Europe and its paltry and prized possessions of freedom and welfare benefits against the influx of Muslim refugees do not help the case of Western moral superiority either. But instead of devaluing the \u201cWestern cultural values\u201d, it is now time to critically reinterpret them and make them \u201cserve as weapons\u201d against the \u201cuniversalism of capital\u201d. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nAnd where does \u017di\u017eek draw inspiration for a more egalitarian tradition? He speaks\u00a0of his understanding of\u00a0the Gandhi\u00ad\u2013Ambedkar debate and recalls how he immediately felt at home among dalits and their viewpoint. Of Gandhi he said, \u201cYou know I have troubles with Gandhi. He was a great guy, he did many great things, but his attitude towards caste was what I\u2019m tempted to call \u2018proto-fascist\u2019. He was not for the abolition of castes, his motto was, \u2018every caste is divine and they have their own role to play\u2019.\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhen\u00a0\u017di\u017eek recalled the members of the Safai Karamchari Andolan telling him that people who clean dry latrines do not want to keep their specific caste identity, the irony of Gandhi\u2019s views was not lost on the audience.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u017di\u017eek\u2019s exclusive book with Navayana, Agitating the Frame: Five Essay on Economy, Ideology, Sexuality and Cinema , threads its way through topics ranging from Daphne du Maurier, through The Dark Knight Rises , to M.K. Gandhi and attempts to psychoanalyse the whole world. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0", "source": "Navayana"}
