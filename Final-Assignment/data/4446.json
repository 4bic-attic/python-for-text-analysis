In wind power for the period 2011 to 2014, top state Iowa added more than 5,500 megawatts, compared to little or no growth for Wisconsin. \n \nThe upper Midwest has been a boom area for wind power except in Wisconsin. As I reported in January of last year, \u201cin 2012 seven percent of the entire world market of wind energy was developed in America\u2019s upper Midwest, but 99.4 percent of this development occurred outside Wisconsin.\u201d \n \n  \u201cWalker and his appointees have pushed new restrictions on windmills, cut tax incentives and research funding and last year imposed the nation\u2019s highest fees on rooftop solar owners,\u201d Bloomberg reporter Alex Nusbaum notes. \n \nThe Alliance for Solar Choice is suing Wisconsin over the new fees, which its spokesperson Amy Heart blames for\u00a0\u201cthe worst\u201d environment in the nation for home solar owners, while increasing revenue for public utilities in Wisconsin. \n \nHeart told Bloomberg that Republican primary voters \u201cwon\u2019t support Governor Walker,\u201d because he\u2019s \u201ca politician who supports state-sponsored monopolies who are killing competition.\u201d \n \nWhile utilities nationally have made the argument that home solar users should pay something to help maintain the electric grid they also depend on, the $30 monthly fee for the typical solar\u00a0customer of Milwaukee-based We Energies Corp. \u00a0makes Wisconsin \u201can outlier\u201d on solar energy nationally, as Ben Inskeep , an analyst at North Carolina State University\u2019s Clean Energy Technology Center, told Bloomberg. \u201cAmong all the cases we\u2019ve seen in the country, this is probably one of the top ones in terms of reducing the value proposition for residential customers.\u201d \n \nLaurel Patrick , the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, didn\u2019t respond to questions from Bloomberg about the new solar fee or wind-siting rules that have helped retard wind power growth in Wisconsin and instead pointed to other \u201calternative energy\u201d measures: \u201cThe administration has backed tax breaks and loans for biodigesters\u00a0that create power from farm waste as well as small-scale generators that let diesel trucks reduce idling.\u201d \n \nWisconsin\u2019s potential to become a wind and solar power state is considerable. Wisconsin ranks 17th highest in wind power potential, according to the American Wind Energy Association, with enough wind power to produce four times more total energy than the state\u2019s current electrical needs. \n \nAnd this area compares favorably to Germany, which now gets more than 50 percent of its electricity through solar power, in the amount of solar radiation it receives. \n \nBut instead of doing all he can to develop the state\u2019s solar and wind power industries, Walker has done his best to keep the state a net energy importer; Wisconsin spends an estimated $12 billion annually to purchase coal and gas and other fossil fuels from other states. \n \n\u201cCritics look at Walker\u2019s record and see the ideological imprint of Charles and David Koch , the billionaire Republican campaign donors,\u201d Nusbaum writers. \u201cThe Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity provided funding and volunteers during Walker\u2019s rise to power in Wisconsin.\u201d \n \nIn fact, David Koch has\u00a0 made it clear that Walker is one of his favorite candidates running in Republican presidential primary.", "source": "Urban Milwaukee"}
