Either could win, and either could start a chain that ends with an SEC filled with two-loss teams, with none of them in the top four. \n \nThat would be as bad for the SEC as Ari's record was last week.\u00a0 \n \nHere's what\u00a0 happened a week ago with our picks: \n \n\u2022 Doug\u00a0 17-4\u00a0 \n \n\u2022 Reader Boniface Womber \u00a016-5 \n \n\u2022 Reader Martin Plush 15-6 \n \n\u2022 Reader Rob Milota \u00a014-7 \n \n\u2022 Bill\u00a0 14-7 \n \n\u2022 Ari \u00a011-10 \n \nTeams \n \nIn our team standings, Boniface and I dominated at 33-9, Bill and Rob went 28-14 and Ari dragged down Martin as Team Ari went 26-16.
