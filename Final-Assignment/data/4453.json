Sometimes the feelings are stormy, and sometimes they\u2019re calm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Towards the 9 month mark, you start to\u00a0confront\u00a0the reality of your loss and your more intense feelings of sadness, anger, heartbreak, fear, guilt and depression.\u00a0 Somewhere in the second year you start to accept your loss and start to make\u00a0accommodations\u00a0in your life for your loss.\u00a0 Your feelings begin to feel less intense and you experience more moments of peace and happiness.\u00a0 As you feel and express your feelings during the different phases of your grief, remember:\u00a0\u00a0it is not that you are having a bad day, but a grieving day.\u00a0\u00a0Just as you cannot stop the waves in the ocean, you cannot stop the feelings of grief.\u00a0 You can only ride the wave of your grief and find a comfortable place to express it.\u00a0\u00a0Find time to be with your pain now; postponed grief returns later.\u00a0 Connect yourself with what you have lost, your old sense of self or the person you lost.\nWendy Feiereisen describes how grief changes as we embrace it in her poem, \u201cGrief\u201d:\nYou don\u2019t get over it. You just get through it. You don\u2019t get by it. Because you can\u2019t get around it. It doesn\u2019t \u201cget better\u201d. It just gets different. Every day, grief puts on a new face. Yearning and searching\u00a0for what you lost is another way of protesting the loss. It is typical during this time to review many of the \u201cIf only\u2026\u201d\u00a0thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again there are no answers to these thoughts.\u00a0\u201cIf \u00a0only\u2026I should have\u2026I could have\u2026\u201d\u00a0are phrases that reflect our intense desire to have control over what happened.\u00a0 When you hear yourself using these phrases, picture a barrier at the top of a slope and stop yourself from finishing the thought.\u00a0 Remember, at the bottom of this slippery slope is a dead end and if you continue your \u201cif only\u201d and \u201cshould have\u201d \u00a0thoughts, you will slide down the slope and then need to climb back up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring this phase there is\u00a0the sensation that it was a mistake; everything will go back to the way it was, my loved one is going to walk through the door any minute or my health will return.\u00a0\u00a0This sensation is usually gone by the 9th month and many people experience this as a particularly intense period of grieving.\u00a0 Somewhere around this time, you begin to move in and out of the\u00a0avoidance phase\u00a0and into the\u00a0confrontation phase\u00a0as you confront the reality that you will not find what you lost.\nConfrontation Phase\nThis phase starts with the recognition that your life will not return to the way it was.\u00a0\u00a0You have moved beyond feeling that your life is surreal and into recognizing that the way your life is now is your new normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your grief during this time is very intense with your feelings being very acute and at times overwhelming, resulting in a state of disorganization. \u00a0 \u00a0\nYES! \u00a0This helps explain why I've been feeling so\u00a0emotional\u00a0 and at such \"loose ends\" lately. This ninth month brings with it the excruciating\u00a0 labor pains\u00a0of birthing a new normal.", "source": "Just M.E."}
