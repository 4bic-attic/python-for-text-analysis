But she was excluded from the recent Globe and Mail debate on the economy \u2014 though she did light up Twitter with video retorts \u2014 and she isn't invited to one sponsored by the Munk Debates on foreign policy.\r \n\r \n\r\n                            In addition, it looks like the sort of widely broadcast English debate seen in previous campaigns may not happen this time since Harper has refused to take part and NDP Leader Tom Mulcair has said he won't participate if Harper doesn't.\r \n\r \n\r\n                            The Greens held just two seats in the last Parliament \u2014 neither in Quebec. But May is enthusiastic about her candidates in the province, including environmental scientist Daniel Green in Montreal and long-time eco-activist Andre Belisle in the riding held by Conservative cabinet minister Steven Blaney.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            As the debate unfolded, May made good on her promise to go after Harper, leaving the other leaders relatively unscathed.\r \n\r \n\r\n                            She believes her presence in the 2008 televised English debate was a factor in holding Harper's Conservatives to a minority. She wasn't invited to the 2011 exchange.\r \n\r \n\r\n                            \"The real dynamic is that when Greens are in the debates, Conservatives don't do as well,\" she said this week in an interview.\r \n\r \n\r\n                            Follow @JimBronskill on Twitter\r \n\r \n\r\n                            By Jim Bronskill, The Canadian Press", "source": "Orangeville Banner"}
