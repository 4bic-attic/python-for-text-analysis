She was one of Kevin Rudd's key supporters. \n\nHer job in booting Hogan out of her former seat would have been a whole lot easier a week or so ago when Tony Abbott was in power. \n\nMalcolm Turnbull has swung swinging voters in behind the Coalition again and now her path back to Page looks far from certain. \n\nHogan hasn't done a bad job since taking up the reins. He's safe and steady and has \"saved\" a few things from the axe. \n\nBut Saffin is a really cunning campaigner and she has a strong list of achievements to point to while in office.", "source": "Daily News"}
