Neuromorphic chips have application areas, namely, image recognition, speech recognition, and data mining. On the basis of application, image recognition is expected to hold the largest market worth USD 542.36 million in 2016. Signal recognition and data mining are expected to grow at CAGRs of 23.65% and 12.77%, respectively, during the forecast period. \n\r\n\r \nThe report forecasts market potential based on current developments in neuromorphic technologies. For instance, Qualcomm Inc. (U.S.) is commercializing a Snapdragon 820 chip which is enabled with neuromorphic capabilities and it uses a cognitive platform called 'Zeroth', or the DARPA funding to IBM Inc. (U.S.) and HRL Laboratories (U.S.), and so on. \n\r\n\r \nThe report also covers te key end-user sectors of the Neuromorphic Chip Market including aerospace, defense & military, medical, automotive, consumer, industrial, and other sectors. The consumer sector is expected to be the largest contributor to the overall neuromorphic chip market, with a share of 99.76% of the market in 2016. The aerospace, military & defense would follow the consumer industry, and hold 0.24% of market share in 2016. Rest of the end user industries are expected to adopt neuromorphic chip by 2018. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \nThe report also covers the neuromorphic chip market for different geographic regions including North America , Europe , Asia-Pacific , and the Rest of the World (RoW). North America is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 33.85% during 2016-2022, followed by Europe . However, Asia-Pacific is expected to hold the highest market share of 50.86% for neuromorphic chip market in 2016. \n\r\n\r \nThe report profiles the major market players with a SWOT analysis of key players in the neuromorphic chip market. The market is expected to witness a series of new product launches, announcements, and partnerships across the value chain. The key players in this industry include Samsung Group ( South Korea ), IBM Corp. (U.S.), Intel Inc. (U.S.), Qualcomm Inc. (U.S.), Hewlett Packard Company (U.S.), General Vision Inc. (U.S.) and others. \n\r\n\r \nBrowse Related Reports \ufffd \n\r\n\r \nMicroprocessor, GPU and Peripherals Market by Architecture (X86, ARM, MIPS, Power), by Application (Personal Computer, Smartphone, Tablet, Server, Embedded), by GPU Type (Discrete, Integrated), by Industry Vertical, and by Geography - Global Trends and Forecasts to 2014 - 2020 \n\r\n\r \nhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/micro-processors-market-28633568.html \n\r\n\r \nHeterogeneous Mobile Processing & Computing Market by Component (processor, GPU, DSP, connectivity), Technology Node (45NM-5NM), Application (Consumer, Tele-communication, Automotive, MDA, Medical), & Geography - Forecast & Analysis to 2014 - 2020 \n\r\n\r \nhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/heterogeneous-mobile-processing-computing-market-173926586.html \n\r\n\r \nAbout MarketsandMarkets \ufffd \n\r\n\r \nMarketsandMarkets is world's No. 2 firm in terms of annually published premium market research reports.
