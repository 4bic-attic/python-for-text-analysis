As an enhancement to the existing Brivo OnAir \u00ae access control system, customers can immediately distribute mobile credentials to their entire user population without any on-premise equipment changes. \u00a0 \n\nAvailable now on both iOS and Android, Brivo's Mobile Pass Application revolutionizes physical security by immediately delivering access control via smartphones without having to install new door readers. Brivo Mobile Pass serves as a mobile complement to physical keycards and readers, and is fully interoperable with existing door reader technologies. \n   \n\"We are giving all of our customers five free Brivo Mobile Passes so that they can use it immediately,\" said Steve Van Till , CEO of Brivo. \"Mobile credentials are changing the way access control works. It's not just about convenience and improved security\u2014although that's a huge part of it. It's that we are improving the relationship with the people who come and go from the spaces we protect.\" \n\nBrivo's previously released Brivo OnAir Mobile Application already provides administrators full accessibility to manage their system from a smartphone; now with Brivo Mobile Pass, all users can open doors using their smartphone. \n\n\"Our customers have been requesting the ability to open doors with their phone,\" said Taylor Carr, Sr. Vice President of Business Development at Securadyne Systems. \"With Brivo Mobile Pass, we now have the means to service that need, all without changing any hardware or sending out a technician. It's proof of the value of a true cloud solution.\" \n\nHow Brivo Mobile Pass Works \n\nBrivo Mobile Pass is a cloud-based mobile credential system that is part of the Brivo OnAir\u00a0platform.\u00a0 From a workflow perspective, the Brivo OnAir\u00a0administrator selects a user and creates a Brivo Mobile Pass invitation that is delivered via email. The user then clicks the \"Add\" button in the email to activate Brivo Mobile Pass on their phone. The user can now open doors as they would have with a keycard, however, Brivo's cloud authentication is far more secure because of the cloud-based authentication. As with keycards, Brivo Mobile Passes can be revoked at any time by the administrator. \n\nFor users, the Brivo Mobile Pass Application is much more convenient and secure than traditional keycards. It travels with them wherever they carry their phone, and it's protected by passcode and biometric capabilities built into the smartphone. When the user wants to open the door he/she simply opens the Brivo Mobile Pass application. It communicates with the cloud using the smartphone's capabilities and requests that the door be opened. No keycard is needed. Brivo Mobile Pass also operates across multiple, unaffiliated Brivo-equipped facilities such as offices, gyms and parking garages. Users can add Brivo Mobile Passes from an unlimited number of Brivo OnAir accounts via email. \n\n\"Naturally, we've invested a lot in encryption and cyber security for this new service,\" said Van Till . \"When designing it, we recognized that cloud-based authentication is a very well understood field, with rich solutions that work very well for banking, electronic signatures, and the like. We chose to adopt these proven secure approaches over the much less developed technologies that are utilizing Bluetooth door readers.\" \n\nThe Brivo Mobile Pass app is available for download from the App Store and Google Play.
