Even the best laid out plan needs to wait and see what the returns show from spent time and monies. In theory, ROI is a modest concept. One of the goals of every business is to produce more than one dollar for each dollar paid out. Getting the ROI formula correct has been more times than not, an uphill battle. Until now, Renegade Global Entrepreneur co-founder, Andrew Cass and affiliates have created a Free \n\n   Renegade Global Entrepreneurs \nseminar that will help business owners small and large alike maximize their returns on every lead. \nCass has taken his many years of proven sales success and turned them into a three step process that will give business owners instantaneous results. He calls these steps, triggers. He will teach how these triggers when properly applied will \"trigger\" a psychological reaction from potential customers to make a buying decision. These triggers will show an immediate response in a business owners marketing, sales, and in their relationships with prospects and clients. \n\nFor example, one of the triggers is a having clarity of communication in the marketplace. Statistics show that 63.4% of business owners were unclear when explaining what they do. This lack of communication confuses their prospects or potential customers. Cass will teach how to have a clear initial message both offline and on. He will also share how to create a unique selling point that will immediately connect with the audience while simultaneously attracting them to want to know more. \n\nAndrew J. Cass is a 19-year Direct Response Marketing Expert, Author, and Speaker. Mr. Cass is a nationally recognized expert speaker on the topics of Direct Response Marketing and Direct Response Sales Training. He is the founder and editor of the first ever iPad Magazine on the topic of 'selling', now featured on the Apple Newsstand, Direct Selling Insider, is the host of the Sales Velocity Podcast, now in Apple iTunes, and author of the book, Sales Velocity. \n\n\"Today business owners are very vague on what it is that they do,\" explains Cass. \"I often joke around and say that they have a sales prevention department in their business because the way they have a dialog whether in person or video, actually tends to deter sales rather than create them.\" \n\nThis free seminar will take place on September 24, 2015 at the Holiday Inn, Ft. Lauderdale Airport from 3:00-6:30 pm and is ideal for any small business owner or entrepreneur that would like to increase their return on investments.
