Wonder no more, because the house is on the market and the listing photos provide the answer. No surprise, the vistas are fantastic. You'd have to hop a ferry to get closer to Alcatraz  So, let's just come out and say it: Everyone who considers living in the Marina worries about earthquake safety. We've all seen maps that predict liquefaction, and no one can say that the Marina is built on bedrock. Let's hope this home has taken proper seismic precautions, because there's a lot to protect in this four-story, five-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom dwelling. There are, of course, the magnificent views of Crissy Field, the water, Alcatraz, and the Golden Gate Bridge; then there's a room for entertaining, complete with a wet bar; and you can't overlook the home gym and sunny back deck. Many of the natural stone finishes are impressive (rare slabs are found throughout) and the appliances are high-end by anyone's measure (hello Sub-Zero, Miele, and Gaggenau). If you hold to the saying that there's safety in numbers, here are some for you: the agents are asking $7,395,000 for the 4,156-square-foot home.\n\u00b7 369 Marina Blvd. [Redfin]", "source": "Curbed SF"}
