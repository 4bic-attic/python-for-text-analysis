When they left the house, lights were off.The man told police he opened the front door, entered the house and saw personal belongings scattered all over the floor.The couple walked through the house and noticed that the doors to their bedroom had been busted open, and the back door had been forced open as well. They checked the house and found no one inside. They then called police.Officers did a walk-through of the house and confirmed that the forced entry was through the back door, as the screen door was pried open and the entry door glass had been broken out.Police determined that the burglar or burglars then broke the glass on the French doors, between a rear room and the kitchen, before going through the entire house and stealing valuables.A detective was called to process the scene. The victims were advised to compile a detailed list of stolen items and to provide it to the detective bureau.", "source": "Heritage News-Herald"}
