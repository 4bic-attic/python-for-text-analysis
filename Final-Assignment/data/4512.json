The apex bank has restricted use of export proceeds and importers of 41 items from accessing foreign exchange (FX) from the Nigerian markets. The bank has also tightened the FX procedures and set rules on domiciliary account to save the economy. \n \nBut the economy is now faced with a scenario where there is a much greater pressure to move funds out of the economy than bring funds into the economy, Bello said. \n \n\u201cRound tripping of forex has continued to flourish because of the disparity in the exchange rate between the official and parallel market. \n \n\u201cSmall businesses have moved to neighbouring countries to effect transfers to their suppliers abroad. Many companies are on the brink of collapse because of failure to access FX for raw materials and other critical inputs. Even companies whose inputs are valid for FX also suffer the same fate,\u201d the LCCI boss said. \n \nHe urged the president to intervene before further damage was done to the private sector and the economy, suggesting that the naira exchange rate should be allowed to reflect the fundamentals of the market. \n \n\u201cA rate that market fundamentals cannot support would not be sustainable. We suggest the adoption of a market approach with a periodic intervention by the CBN as the capacity permits,\u201d he suggested. \n \nHe said exporters should be allowed to have unfettered access to their proceeds, saying that the current policy regarding export proceeds was a disincentive. \n \nHe further pointed out that the apex bank should engage with relevant economic ministries in order to bring about coherence in the management of the Nigerian economy. \n \nSome of the problems the country faces relate to the problem of poor productivity, he said, urging the Federal Government to accelerate investment in infrastructure and build quality institutions for better productivity in the country. \n \nSource: Business Day", "source": "NewsNG.com"}
