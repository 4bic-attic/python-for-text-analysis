Michel Aoun is the figure who is qualified to play this role.\u201d\n\nLebanon has been without a president since the term of Michel Sleiman ended in May 2014, leading to the paralysis of state institutions.\n\nAsked whether Rai voiced any reaction to Hezbollah\u2019s support for Aoun during the meeting, Sayyed affirmed that although the party supported the candidacy of Aoun, they were not the group which proposed his nomination. \u201cHe is a presidential candidate and we support him as presidential candidate ... it is not true that Gen. Aoun does not want to be president of the republic and that we have convinced him to be president.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is true that the patriarch is insisting on the election of a president and this is his opinion, and we believe that this is possible given Gen. Aoun\u2019s presidential candidacy.\u201d\n\nSayyed dismissed claims that Hezbollah was now handling negotiations to secure the release of 25 Lebanese servicemen kidnapped by ISIS and the Nusra Front during a five-day battle in the northeastern town of Arsal in August 2014. \n\n\u201cThis file is in the hands of the state and will remain in the hands of the state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright The Daily Star 2015. \u00a9 Copyright Zawya.
