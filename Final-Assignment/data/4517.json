The three, who are not sworn deputies and had worked at the jail for less than three years, are due in court Tuesday.\u200b\n\nThey are accused of fatally beating 31-year-old Michael James Pipkin Tyree, who died Aug. 26 and was found the next morning while in protective custody at the main jail in San Jose. Having pleaded no contest to petty theft in a special mental-health court Aug. 23, he was waiting to be sent to a mental-health facility, the Mercury News wrote.\n\nThe medical examiner determined Tyree died of multiple blunt-force injuries, \"visceral lacerations\" and internal bleeding.\n\nThe decision to recommend murder charges has \"no known precedent\" in the 165-year history of the sheriff's office, the paper stated.\n\n\"Our client was slated to be released to a mental health bed but no bed was available, thus the reason he was still in jail,'' Santa Clara County Public Defender Molly O'Neal said Thursday. \"This tragedy underscores the need for a greater number of mental health beds so that clients with acute mental health needs do not sit in custodial facilities which are not therapeutic when they have been ordered released.\"\n\nSheriff Laurie Smith addressed the case at an afternoon news conference.", "source": "USA Today"}
