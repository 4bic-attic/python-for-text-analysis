With the Ohio State cornerback dwelling on one mistake, suddenly he was making more of them, adding even more negative thoughts in his head and leaving the coaching staff no choice but to send him to the bench. Conley clearly wasn\u2019t ready mentally for the pressure that came with being forced into the starting lineup late last season, and it didn\u2019t take long for Michigan State to figure that out and focus its attention on him early, often and with plenty of success last November. Nearly a year later, opponents are still likely to target Conley given how many elite players surround him for the top-ranked Buckeyes, but it\u2019s quickly becoming clear that he\u2019s no longer somebody to pick on and is poised to become yet another defensive bully. Gareon Conley called his first career interception last week and the celebration that followed \u2018the best feeling ever.\u2019\u00a0Jason Mowry/Icon Sportswire\u201cLast year I was a thinker,\u201d Conley said. \u201cI thought a lot about making mistakes and worrying about what-if this, what-if that. Now I just play to my ability and I know that my coaches and my teammates are confident in me. \u201cI felt down in the dumps [at Michigan State], and I know I can\u2019t get that play back, but I just kept thinking about it over and over again. That led to more bad plays. I\u2019m probably going to have more bad plays because nobody is perfect, I just know now after every bad play you have to snap and clear, play the next play.\u201d The same principle applies to the positive plays, too, and so far that\u2019s pretty much been the only test for Conley\u2019s new and improved mental approach this season. Firmly entrenched as the starter opposite Eli Apple instead of just merely filling in for him due to injury, Conley is making it less and less appealing to test his side of the field as he develops into the shutdown cornerback Ohio State anticipated when it signed him in 2013. And while Apple and the presence of playmakers Tyvis Powell and Vonn Bell at safety will still make Conley seem like the safest place for opposing quarterbacks to try to attack, the early returns suggest it\u2019s every bit as dangerous. \u2026 Continue Reading: Improved Gareon Conley leaves no safe place to throw against Ohio State", "source": "BucksInsider.com - Ohio State Buckeyes News, Videos, Schedules"}
