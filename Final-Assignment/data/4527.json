A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Warner/Chappell Music\u2019s claim to the rights, which earned them an estimated $2 million dollars a year, is not valid. \n\nWarner had been collecting royalties on the song since the 1980s when it bought Birch Tree Group, the successor to Clayton F. Summy Co., which claimed the original copyright. \n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times: \n\nJudge George H. King ruled Tuesday afternoon that a copyright filed by the Summy Co. in 1935 granted only the rights to specific arrangements of the music, not the actual song itself. \n\n\u201cBecause Summy Co. never acquired the rights to the Happy Birthday lyrics,\u201d wrote King. \u201cDefendants, as Summy Co.\u2019s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics.\u201d \n\nTo arrive at his decision, the judge considered a 1922 songbook which features a version of the birthday song called \u201cGood Morning and Birthday Song,\u201d written by sisters Mildred and Patty Hill. That iteration of the tune includes the familiar \u201chappy birthday to you\u201d lyrics and is listed as appearing through \u201cspecial permission\u201d of the Summy Company with no mention of a copyright. \n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Warner by two filmmakers making a documentary about the song\u2019s origins. The publisher charged $1,500 to use it. \n\nClick here to read full story \u00bb", "source": "997WTN.com"}
