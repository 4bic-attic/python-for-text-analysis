(For a fun overview, check out the #GrenacheDay hashtag on Twitter.)\u00a0We celebrated by harvesting a half-acre block of our vineyard that was originally planted by our VINsider Wine Club members back in 2003.\u00a0 The hands-on seminar focused on planting and vineyard care and gave members an opportunity to make an impact on the vineyard and wine we\u2019re working with today.\rEarly this morning, Viticulturist Levi Glenn and his trusty vineyard dog Mavis collected samples from the block we call Grenache Noir Wine Club Head Pruned -- GNWCHP for short -- to test whether the lot was ready to pick.\rMavis is convinced; let's see what Neil Collins, Vineyard Manager and Executive Winemaker has to say.\rNeil used a refractometer to asses the sugar levels on the Grenache sample and decided we could harvest this block of estate Grenache.\rOur cellar crew enjoyed a welcomed break from processing fruit and got to feel the sun on their faces as they picked Grenache in the vineyard this morning.\rThe fruit looked spectacular and although yields looked light on this block, quality is fantastic!\rWe picked .75 tons from the head-pruned, dry-farmed lot.\rWhat a way to celebrate #Harvest2015 and International #GrenacheDay!\u00a0 Cheers!", "source": "Tablas Creek Vineyard Blog"}
