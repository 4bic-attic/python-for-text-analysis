However, after 45 minutes, they decided they needed a little help from some of their pals and those pals just happened to be some of the biggest names in the UK right now:\u00a0Big Narstie, Stormzy, Shola Ama, MC Vapour and Masters Of Ceremonies legend,\u00a0MC DT. But that wasn't all. After Grindah invited Stormzy\u00a0on to \"give him a chance to spit some bars, get out there and that,\" the Kurupt FM boys brought in their secret weapon: Craig David. \n\nUnderstandably intimidated by Grindah, Beats and Steve's lyrical prowess, the UKG sensation readily admitted that he'd had a few years out of the game so that he could really study Kurupt FM and what they did. But before long, he was back in the swing of things, banging out a rendition of \"Fill Me In\" as well as a brand new track. As you might expect, Big Narstie was utterly gassed.
