Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo based in Plano, Texas, said all of the donations will go to the It Gets Better Project. \n\nRam Krishnan, Frito Lay's chief marketing officer, said the chips \"show our commitment toward equal rights for the LGBT community and celebrate humanity without exception.\" \n\nThe announcement was made just days ahead of this Sunday's Dallas Pride event, which counts Doritos among its corporate sponsors.", "source": "Lincoln Journal Star"}
