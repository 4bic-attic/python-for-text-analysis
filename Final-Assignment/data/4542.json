Pochettino\u2019s men finally appear to be turning a corner in the division after an inconsistent start, which saw them fail to win their first four games. \n \nSpurs have now scored nine goals and conceded only five, which is the fewest in the league so far, level with Everton, Manchester United and Watford. The Lilywhites looked more dynamic and threatening against City and scored more than two goals in a game for the first time this season. \n \nSpurs have conceded the fewest goals in the league this season. \n \nSupporters will also be encouraged to have seen Kane score his first goal of the new term as he looks to build upon the success that he experienced last season. Lamela\u2019s goal was also significant as it was the first time the much-maligned midfielder has scored in the division since April 25th. \n \nTottenham have created 89 chances in the league this season. \n \n\n \nThe post Pochettino on Man City victory: \u201cThis is how we want to play\u201d appeared first on Squawka News .", "source": "Squawka News"}
