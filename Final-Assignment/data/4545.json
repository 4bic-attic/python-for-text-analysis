A pipeline that feeds the primary unit does not have enough pressure to run a second unit that vaporizes contaminants through heat and pressure, he said. \n \n\u201cThe biggest issue is there is not enough gas to run a second thermal desorption unit,\u201d he said, calling it \u201can irony\u201d due to the high amount of natural gas in the region that is being burned off as a byproduct of oil production. \n \nTesoro and federal regulators have said a lightning strike may have caused the rupture in the 6-inch-diameter steel pipeline, which runs from Tioga to a rail facility outside of Columbus, near the Canadian border. The spill has been called one of the largest onshore spills in U.S. history, covering 7.3 acres of land, about the size of seven football fields. The incident exposed that North Dakota regulators had known about the spill but failed to notify the public _ or even some top state officials _ until The Associated Press asked about it. \n \nRegulators have said the spill caused no damage to water or wildlife. The pipeline was restarted about a month after the spill, after Tesoro accepted a federally imposed safety plan, which requires frequent aerial and ground inspections and additional leak-detection equipment. \n \nThe company initially estimated cleanup would take two years and would cost $4 million. The cost is now pegged at more than $20 million. \n \nTesoro said in a statement that about 6,000 barrels of oil have been recovered. \n \nCrews initially burned oil from the surface and later used vacuums to recover it. That proved ineffective after the oil seeped far underground, officials said. Workers have excavated more than 333,000 tons of soil and treated it using the thermal desorption technology, Suess said. \n \nThe company declined to say whether it would add a second thermal desorption unit. The sole unit at the site is \u201coperating 24 hours a day, seven days a week to systematically burn the hydrocarbons from the contaminated soil,\u201d Tesoro said. \n \n\u201cWe routinely evaluate our options in cleanup efforts and have not yet completed an evaluation of the use of a second desorption unit,\u201d the company said.", "source": "Canadian Manufacturing"}
