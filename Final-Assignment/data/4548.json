A bout of gout saw an Evatt man accused of lying to the royal commission into unions to be locked up on a bail breach. Tuungafasi Manase, of Evatt, was last month during a commission hearing.\n\nA Canberra magistrate granted bail on condition he report to police three times a week.\n\nBut Manase failed to report on Saturday and was arrested by police when he reported on Monday.\n\nHis lawyer, Toni Tu'ulakitau, told the court his client had been bedridden on Saturday by gout.\n\nMagistrate Robert Cook granted Manase bail on the same conditions, but told him to call police in advance if he could not meet his obligations.\n\nMr Cook warned any future breaches could see the defendant's bail revoked and he would spent time behind bars.\n\nManase will reappear next month. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "source": "Lithgow Mercury"}
