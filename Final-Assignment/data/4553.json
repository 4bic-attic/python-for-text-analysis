When you take a step forward, your heel should contact the ground first and proceed to roll through your foot toward your toes. \n Muscle Mass  \nLifting lighter weight with more repetitions can increase muscle mass .

Even record the day\u2019s weather. You will later begin to pick out certain patterns. If you were unable to exercise for a day or two, then write down the reason why. \n \nTIP! Sit ups and crunches are not all you need for 6 pack abs.

When you are weight lifting, squeeze your buttocks each time you lift the weights up. This is an excellent workout for your butt, but most importantly, it helps you minimize your chance of injury because your body is being forced to position itself more effectively. \n \nWhen selecting a workout bench, push down on the padding with your fingers to check the thickness. If it is easy for you to feel the wooden surface beneath the padding, move on to another machine.
