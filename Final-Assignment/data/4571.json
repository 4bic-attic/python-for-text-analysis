It\u2019s that promising to \u201cknow more about the problems of this world when I sit\u201d in the Oval office, as Trump said Wednesday night, isn\u2019t good enough. \n\n\u201cThere is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cA gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he\u2019s threatening to destroy and divide NATO.\u201d \n\nAnd, he might have added, we\u2019ve had seven years of an administration that just lets it all happen. \n\n\u201cWeakness is provocative,\u201d U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said during one of his better moments. \n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina had a detailed, rapid-fire cure for that problem. \n\n\u201cWe need the strongest military on the face of the planet and everyone has to know what that means,\u201d she said. She also supported rebuilding missile defense programs in Poland, a larger U.S. military presence in Europe, an expanded Navy and an updated nuclear arsenal. \n\nSomewhere Ronald Reagan would be smiling. \n\nAnd the underrated Jeb Bush had his moment too \u2014 even if it was in defense of his brother, who he has spent time distancing himself from. \n\n\u201cHe kept us safe. ... He sent a clear signal the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism,\u201d Bush said of George W. Bush. \n\nYes, there was indeed substance in this debate. Sure, sometimes you have to listen a little harder for it. But there is a richness to this GOP field \u2014 blowhard billionaires notwithstanding.", "source": "Boston Herald"}
