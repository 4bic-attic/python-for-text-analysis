Speculation of extended stimulus from the European Central Bank increased after Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Monday that policy makers would \u201cforcefully react\u201d to defend their inflation objective. Since the ECB started its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) bond- buying program in March, inflation in the currency bloc has slowed to a near standstill, compared with the ECB\u2019s goal of just below 2 percent. \n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to refrain from increasing interest rates last week has bolstered the prospect of the ECB extending its \u201ceasy-monetary policy stance,\u201d according to Rabobank International. \n\n\u201cWe are seeing softness in European equities and that provides a conducive backdrop for fixed income,\u201d said Richard McGuire, head of European rates strategy at Rabobank in London. He added that \u201congoing speculation of additional central-bank support in Europe and beyond, in the wake of the Fed\u2019s steady rate decision, may be also playing a part here.\u201d \n\nGermany\u2019s five-year note yields declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to minus 0.015 percent at 3:15 p.m. London time. That\u2019s the first time the yield has fallen below zero since Aug. 25. The 0.25 percent security due October 2020 climbed 0.285, or 2.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.34. The nation\u2019s 10-year bund yield dropped eight basis points to 0.61 percent. \n\nSimilar-maturity French bond yields fell seven basis points to 0.99 percent, and those on Italy\u2019s declined five basis points to 1.76 percent. \n\nDutch Auction \n\nThe Netherlands sold 2.8 billion euros of three-year debt at a record-low yield. The Dutch State Treasury Agency allotted the notes due in April 2018 at an average yield of minus 0.156 percent, down from minus 0.032 percent at a previous auction on June 9. Yields on Dutch two-year notes fell to a record low of minus 0.246 percent. \n\nA negative yield means investors buying the securities now will get back less\u00a0if they hold them until maturity than they paid. \n\nThe primary focus for European bond markets will be economic data, according to Luca Cazzulani, senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. \n\n\u201cRight now we have to look at the data because that will tell you where the momentum is going,\u201d Cazzulani said. \u201cThe ECB is saying they will intervene and do more if needed and that ultimately depends on the data.\u201d \n\nAnalysts said a report on Wednesday will show that a gauge of euro-area manufacturing growth slowed this month. Markit Economics\u2019 Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell to 52 from 52.3 in August,\u00a0according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That would be the lowest reading since April.", "source": "La Repubblica"}
