And they know which one is which. They love to have their dinos play outside with them, watch them eat dinner, come to school for show and tell, watch them in movies, snuggle them in bed, make puzzles out of them.\u00a0 (I feel like Bubba and his shrimp - shrimp gumbo, shrimp kabobs, shrimp soup...).\n\nDuring a recent trip to the Steel City - go Steelers! We went to Carnegie Museum to check out their dino exhibit. And my kids were impressed.\n\n\n\nThere were so many dinos to see. They got to touch dino fossils\n\nAnd they got to dig up in a kid-friendly dig site. Complete with safety goggles, chisels and brushes. It was adorable.\n\n\n\nMy kids keep asking when we can go back. It was such a great learning experience and it was neat for the kids to see how huge dinos really are.\n\n\n\nAre your kids super-obsessed with anything right now?", "source": "Life As A Dean"}
