I had no idea this would ever be a Number One record. I wrote this song in my bedroom on a Sunday evening after a couple of beers. I had no idea it would go to the top of the charts!\" \n\nMeanwhile, Bieber earned a spot in history after his new single What Do You Mean? broke the UK's all-time streaming record,  clocking up 3.87 million plays in the last seven days. \n\nThe feat means Justin overtakes previous record-holder Wiz Khalifa's See You Again feat. Charlie Puth, which counted 3.72 million streams back in April. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "West Sussex Today"}
