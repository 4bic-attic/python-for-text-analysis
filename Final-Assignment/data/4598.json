SCOTT, Que. - The leader of Quebec's third party says Canada must offer a new deal giving the province more powers over a host of areas including language and immigration. \n\nSpeaking to reporters today at a caucus retreat, Francois Legault said he's offering Quebecers a new, modern nationalism that will create a strong Quebec in Canada. \n\nHis party, The Coalition for Quebec's Future, is against sovereignty but claims to be staunchly nationalist. \n\nLegault said his party will produce by November a detailed proposal including a list of demands seeking for Quebec more control over its affairs. \n\nHe says the governing Liberals are too passive in their relationship with the federal government and the Parti Quebecois' goals of independence are not reflective of the wishes of the majority. \n\nLegault said his party will offer a clear, middle ground that seeks to keep Quebec in Canada but with additional powers, particularly over immigration and language. \n \nContent Provided By Canadian Press.", "source": "CJAD 800"}
