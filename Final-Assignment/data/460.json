Only a rise to $1,638 could confirm a valid break, and the target at $1,686, the 38.2 percent will then be resumed. \n\nMost likely, the metal will drop to $1,575, the 14.6 percent retracement, as it has not pulled back towards a trendline falling from $1,977. \n\nThe next resistance will be at $1,686, the 38.2 percent level. \nCopyright Reuters, 2", "source": "Business Recorder"}
