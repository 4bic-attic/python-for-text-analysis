The state auditor says that the state failed to spend $110 million in federal funds on the special education students between July 2009 and June 2013.That shortfall puts the state at risk of losing millions from the feds.Attorney General Hector Balderas, who was state auditor, ordered the special audit and told the Legislature in 2014 the state could lose $60 million.The audit also reported the PED knew of the problem, but didn\u2019t tell lawmakers.Now Auditor Tim Keller says \u201cThis report highlights serious shortcomings in our state\u2019s ability to serve special education students, who are some of the most vulnerable participants in our education system and deserve better.\u201dThe Santa Fe New Mexican did a story about the issue and has requested a response from the PED.The Legislative Education Study Committee first raised this issue in 2013, and since then the department has been involved in lawsuits and filings with the U.S. Department of Education over the way the feds calculate special education funding.The state also requested a waiver from the funding requirements during the recession.The Department of Ed so far hasn\u2019t bought the state\u2019s argument, but then neither did a hearings judge who wrote the state that he\u2019s \u201cunpersuaded\u201d by the state\u2019s argument they have the right to reduce funding for special education if they wish.\u00a0 The judge says the state has to meet a base level of funding and can only increase it.The federal money the state could lose is important.\u00a0 It pays for such things as counseling, aides, diagnostics and speech and language help.\u00a0 That is all included in the Individualized Education Programs for many of the nearly 47,000 special education students.The auditor says the state failed to spend $47 million in 2010, $30 million in 2012 and $35 million in 2011.While the state says they have the right to do what they wish in the funding of special education services, if they don\u2019t toe the federal line, they lose millions and will end up having to spend that and more on the services now paid by Washington.The Legislature will certainly have something to say about the latest round fired by Democrat Tim Keller, the State Auditor.Since he\u2019s been in office, he has gone after agencies and their leaders more aggressively than ever before.Some on the GOP side say it is a political witch hunt that he\u2019s trying to take down the Republican Party.Keller, of course, denies that and says he\u2019s just doing his job.If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please let me know at mark.bentley76@gmail.com.Thanks for reading!\u00a9 All rights reserved\nMark Bentley has been covering New Mexico politics for more than 25 years and in addition to this blog, airs a radio version \u201cDateline New Mexico\u201d on numerous stations around the state.You can hear other programs from Mark Bentley at his website CowboyReporter.com.\n-30-", "source": "Mark Bentley's Inside Politics"}
