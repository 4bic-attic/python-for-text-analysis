Pursuing that cause has often required forging a new road, one that improves upon the old, worn path followed by other health care organizations. It has meant going against the flow. But Kaiser Permanente's difference also has a purpose \u2014 to support the total health of each of its more than 10 million members. \n \nThese are the themes of Kaiser Permanente's latest installment of its award-winning Thrive advertising campaign , which debuts today across TV, radio, online, print and outdoor platforms in markets throughout the country. In addition to advancing the ideal of total health, the ads tell the story of where the pioneering health care organization started, where it has been, and where it plans to go. \n \n\"The new Thrive campaign illustrates our core beliefs as an organization and represents our goal of a long, healthy, thriving life for each of our members and for the communities we serve,\" said Christine Paige, senior vice president of Marketing and Digital Services at Kaiser Permanente. \"The ads focus on Kaiser Permanente's 70 years of leadership in promoting total health, and reinforce our promise to be the trusted health partner for our members.\" \n \nThe ads focus on Kaiser Permanente's dedication to preventive medicine, and the goal of keeping its members healthy by being accessible to them anytime, anywhere. The historical images of Henry J. Kaiser featured in one ad are poignant and illustrate how Kaiser Permanente today remains true to its roots, and continues to grow and evolve to meet the demands of the modern consumer. \n \nThe stories told in the campaign, now in its 12th year, feature individuals and families at all stages of life \u2013 of varying age, race, abilities and background \u2013 a fitting reflection of Kaiser Permanente's vibrant and diverse membership, now more than 10 million strong. The range of individuals featured in the TV spots provides context for Kaiser Permanente's steadfast commitment that health care should be affordable and accessible for every person and every family. The stories also convey that even as Kaiser Permanente becomes the leader in leveraging technology to maximize quality and convenience, our care will remain as personalized as ever. \n \nThe Thrive campaign has been widely recognized and emulated throughout the marketing and advertising space. Over the past decade, the campaign has garnered eight Gold Healthcare Public Relations and Marketing Association awards, and more than 11 ADDY Awards in various categories. \n \nThe multi-year Thrive campaign was created in partnership with advertising agency Campbell Ewald, which has worked with Kaiser Permanente since the rollout of the first Thrive ads in 2004. \n \nTelevision, print and outdoor versions of the ads will appear in English and Spanish throughout the states where Kaiser Permanente provides health care services: California, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia and the District of Columbia. \n \nAbout Kaiser Permanente \nKaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health\u00a0care.
