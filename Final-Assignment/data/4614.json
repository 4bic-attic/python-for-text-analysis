Three firefighters perished and four others were injured in the early days of the disaster. \n\nThe most seriously hurt survivor, burned over 60 percent of his body, was upgraded from critical to serious condition on Tuesday but remained hospitalised in intensive care, doctors said. \n\nThe Okanogan was one 16 active conflagrations in Washington state that have charred more than 900,000 acres, an area larger than Rhode Island, said the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. \n\nThe nearby North Star Complex, which has scorched about 205,000 acres of timber, mostly on the Coleville Indian Reservation, was reported at 25 percent containment. \n\nIn southeastern Washington, crews also aided by improved weather conditions had contained half of the 92,000-acre Chelan Complex, which has injured eight people and gutted more than 20 homes. \n\nA total of 64 large wildfires or clusters of fires were under attack throughout Washington and several other Western states on Tuesday, including Idaho, Montana, Oregon and California, according to the Interagency Fire Center. \n\nThose blazes were reported to have blackened more than 1.9 million acres of the drought-stricken region.", "source": "Eye Witness News"}
