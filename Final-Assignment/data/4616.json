The buyer, businessman David Crammond, sold his National Waste interest to Kerry Packer in the late 1980s.\n\nMr Crammond sold off a slice of the estate's yard for $2 million. In 2006, he traded the renovated period home for $14 million, setting an Armadale record.\n\nA few weeks ago, one of the modern mansions developed on a small block around Yooralla's former building at 2-6 Flete Avenue was sold for more than $8 million.
