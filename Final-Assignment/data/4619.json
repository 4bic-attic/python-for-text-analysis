I also didn't expect the depth of field here. It's the hardest event I have ever done. So I'm really pleased with what we have done here.\" \n\n\"I didn't look out of the boat. It was all about seeing how well we could do by racing our own race. Today the Kiwis were good enough but now it's game on,\" Taylor added. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nWill Fletcher and Richard Chambers, selected for the first time this season in the men's lightweights, also won silver, while Scott Durant, Alan Sinclair, Tom Ransley and Stewart Innes won bronze in the men's four. \n\n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Mirfieldtoday"}
