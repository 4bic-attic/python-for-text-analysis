Recently recognized in Solar Power World Magazine as the largest solar contractor in Texas, Freedom Solar has been innovating in the solar space to provide better solutions and delighted customers. \n \n\"We are in a race against the clock,\" says Kyle Frazier, Director of Sales for Freedom Solar.  \"As incentives burn off for solar we are relying more and more on driving cost from the equation.  And this must be done without compromising the products or services that we deliver to the end customer. When you are installing one new residential system every day of the week as we are, you need a scalable solution.\" \n \nCommonly referred to as \"soft costs\", the design, permitting, and install costs associated with a solar project are the focus of attention for many installers.  As manufacturers work to drive costs from the products they make, Installers must also do their part to improve efficiency.  \"Nearly 6% of our revenue goes towards Indirect costs,\" Says Chad Preece, COO for Freedom Solar.  \"This includes site technicians and QC techs who drive all over Texas measuring roof tops and evaluating them for solar.  There has to be a better way, there is a better way, and we think we've found it.  We're excited to partner with HoverStat and their innovative roof mapping technology, and couldn't think of a better technology partner to help Freedom Solar deliver industry leading solutions for home owners and businesses.\" \n \nAbout Freedom Solar \n \nFounded in 2007, Freedom Solar started as an installation company, constructing some of the largest solar projects in Texas. After establishing themselves as a leading photovoltaic (PV) panel installer, Freedom Solar expanded their business model to offer services directly to residential, commercial, and institutional markets.
