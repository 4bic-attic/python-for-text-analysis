The New Zealand Herald has reported the purchase price was $NZ110 million ($A97.97 million). Manuka Health was founded in 2006 and exports 90-plus products based on propolis, royal jelly, bee pollen, and manuka honey to 45 countries. It has annual turnover of more than $NZ50m. The deal comes after the company ruled out a public offer in June as it looked for funding for a global roll-out of new products said to boost the antibacterial qualities of manuka honey and its pipeline of research and development. \"PEP approached us really only a short time ago really and they worked very quickly at doing their due diligence and negotiating an agreement with us,\" Mr Paul told BusinessDesk. He would stay on as chief executive, and there would be no staff changes, he said. Asian demand for manuka honey has lifted the price for all New Zealand honey, amid a global honey shortage. New Zealand bees produced $NZ187 million of exported honey in the June 2014 year, up eight per cent by volume and almost 30 per cent by value on the previous year. PEP has $A6 billion of funds equity funds under management, making it the largest private equity fund manager in Australasia, according to its website. PEP's other consumer product investments include Griffin's Foods, Tegel, Frucor and Peter's Ice Cream.", "source": "Townsville Bulletin"}
