Robotech is back! \n \nChapter 83: Reflex Point \n \nThis is exciting! Reflex Point! The whole story has been heading towards this point for so long! My expectations are very high. \n \nThe Regis muses on irony, and how protoculture allows the Invid to change into any form they like, but their extensive research has concluded that HUMANS, HUMANS ARE THE BEST DESIGN. \n \n\u201cWe are Invid, we cannot fail, I will not allow it.\u201d \n \n \n\n \nA group of troublemakers, AKA our heroes, are startled by an explosion nearby. Hoping it might be that spunky Rick Hunter, they head towards it only to find some damaged mecha in a smoking crater. \n \nScott carefully surveys the damaged mecha and pronounces that there are no survivors. \n \n\u201cNobody said war was pretty.\u201d The narrator, setting the tone as always. \n \nProving that Scott is an idiot, a survivor promptly turns up \u2013 an intelligence agent called Sue Graham, who looks a lot like Marie Crystal but isn\u2019t. Her assignment is to record the mission for Admiral Hunter and send him information. \n \nScott is furious to find out that Sue filmed the deaths of her colleagues instead of joining in the battle and getting killed alongside them. He and Lancer get aggressive and judgy at her. \n \nHundreds of Invid are approaching. Sue tells them all to deactivate their protoculture cells and abandon the mecha so the Invid think everyone is dead, but they are so busy not trusting her that they leave it to the last minute and only just make it into the woods. \n \nTheir Cyclones have a near miss, but the jeep and the Beta are both knocked into a ravine by the stompy Invid. Aww, ships, no. (Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re fine later) \n \nSue has some good news, at least: there is a force of Admiral Hunter\u2019s fleet, called shadow fighters, hanging around the dark side of the moon, ready to launch an assault against the Invid when \u201cthe time is right\u201d. Scott repeatedly challenges her about doing her job (passing information to the local fighters to give them hope, and collecting data to send back to the fleet) rather than going rogue freedom fighter like him, which is the Only Correct Moral Choice. \n \nScott needs to not be in charge any more. \n \n#TeamSue \n \nThe crew all have adorable space sleeping bags that make them look like caterpillars. Scott is angsting about Marlene Mark I, and Marlene Mark II suggests that he\u2019s never going to be over her. She has a good point considering that he NAMED HER AFTER HIS DEAD GIRLFRIEND. \n \nScott and the crew are reluctantly going on a mission to collect a magic special space cannon that Sue told them about. Scott suspects that Sue has set them up so she can get some amazing footage of them getting \u201ccreamed\u201d by the Invid. \n \nI\u2019m confused by their lack of distinction between a spy collecting necessary war intelligence, and a paparazzo-style media bunny. Mind you, Sue doesn\u2019t help the situation by saying things like \u201cAdmiral Hunter\u2019s going to love this footage\u201d which implies she is creating entertainment for the poor bored Admiral instead of, you know, helping the war effort. \n \nOn the other hand, maybe Rick is just super bored. It\u2019s not easy at the top. \n \nEven the narrator complains that Sue is shooting nothing but film footage, when the Invid attack. Annie isn\u2019t shooting anyone either! Because it\u2019s NOT HER JOB OR HER SKILLSET. \n \nI can\u2019t help noticing that this episode called Reflex Point does not seem to actually have anything to do with Reflex Point. Surely they\u2019ll get there soon, right? Right? \n \nThe leader of this particular Invid battalion is a glam rock style blond who bleeds green when he is killed. Sue is delighted to have proof that the Invid are turning themselves into humans \u2013 but Marlene is less than delighted, because she is bleeding green from a scratch on her arm. \n \nYOU GUYS I THINK MARLENE IS AN INVID! \n \nMarlene flees in horror, and Scott is surprisingly calm and forgiving about the whole thing, thinking more about how upset she must be than worrying about whether she was spying on them. It\u2019s his one moment of being pretty awesome in an episode that is mostly all about him being a dick. \n \nSue drops dead from, I don\u2019t know, irony, I guess, and Scott gives a grave speech about how she was the most dedicated professional he ever met in the REF, which goes to show that even when he\u2019s being nice, he\u2019s also a massive hypocrite. \n \nAs the episode closes without any sign of Reflex Point, the narrator works harder to get up our hopes that Admiral Hunter will be turning up any minute. \n \nI\u2026 don\u2019t think he can be trusted\u2026 \n \nBut they wouldn\u2019t keep mentioning Admiral Hunter this much if he wasn\u2019t going to turn up in the final episode, right? RIGHT? \n \nThis weekly rewatch of classic animated space opera Robotech is brought to you as bonus content for the Musketeer Space project. \n \nThanks to everyone who has linked, commented, or sponsored me. \n \nYou can support the blog at Patreon .", "source": "tansyrr.com"}
