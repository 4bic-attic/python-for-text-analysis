What\u2019s less certain is the outcome of dealing with the company made the thing in the first place. Whether it involves a warranty dispute or a repair issue whose resolution moves with the speed of erosion, consumers routinely have to talk with a manufacturer to solve a problem. That means more than a rambling, heated rant if you want to get results. \u201cComplaining is really an art,\u201d said Katherine Hutt, a spokesperson for the Better Business Bureau . And it pays to know a few guidelines that underscore the fine art of effective complaining. Your ideal resolution When your six-month-old refrigerator suddenly turns your ice cream into vanilla-flavored gazpacho, it\u2019s hard to focus on anything except getting it fixed as quickly as possible. But, if you decide to take the matter up with the refrigerator manufacturer, it\u2019s important to first define your long-term goals. Knowing precisely what sort of resolution you\u2019d ideally like to get \u2014 as well as what you\u2019d be willing to settle for \u2014can keep you more focused and persuasive. \u201cThe problem is that most people get stuck on describing the problem,\u201d said Anchorage, Alaska, mediator Christian Muntean. \u201cWhat would be my ideal solution? What is the least I am willing to accept? What do one or two middle options look like?\u201d That attitude opens up more possibilities than a rigid \"either/or\" approach that often leads to a dead end of either the company replaces the item or denies any responsibility. \u201cSometimes, the item can't be replaced but it can be repaired. Sometimes a gift certificate can be sent. Sometimes credit towards a future purchase. Perhaps an additional warranty or service or upgrade can be added,\" Muntean said. \"Try to be creative in options.\u201d Lastly, keep your expectations realistic and honest. For instance, don\u2019t ask a television manufacturer to replace your set when you know your kids were using the screen as a bounce back for tennis balls. \u201cAm I disputing this in good faith? Is there any aspect of the problem that may be my responsibility?\u201d asked Muntean. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if all you\u2019re trying to do is game the system.\u201d Who to talk to? One obvious question at the outset of a product or service issue is who best to contact. A number of possibilities exist. For instance, most companies offer a customer support service or some other similarly titled department to handle customer issues. Page 2 of 3 - Experts urge consumers to make contact via telephone or, if possible, in person. Emails, online live support and other similar options lack the persuasive impact that in-personal conversation can provide. \u201cMy preference is to contact the company by phone first,\u201d said Randi Busse, author of \"Turning Rants Into Raves: Turn Your Customers on Before They Turn on YOU!\" \u201cGetting a human being on the other end of the line and calmly explaining the situation could be all it takes to resolve the issue.\u201d If contacting customer support gets you nowhere, another strategy is to effectively leapfrog the rest of the organization. That can mean crafting a thoughtful letter to the company\u2019s president or CEO to outline the situation and voice your frustration in a constructive, respectful manner. \u201cMy father taught me to start at the top, writing a letter to the company principal,\u201d said consultant Wilson Black. \u201cFirst, acknowledge he may be very busy and express your trust in him to delegate the matter to the proper authority. This intro is followed by a detailed description of the problem, written in a matter-of-fact style, without accusation or belligerence.\u201d Manners, please Black\u2019s strategy highlights a central feature of pursuing an effective product service complaint. However tempting it may be to explode at anyone within earshot, it\u2019s essential to keep all communication respectful, constructive and dignified. \u201cWhen dealing with a company, bear in mind the Three Ps: polite, persistent and patient,\u201d said Christopher Elliott, author of \u201c Scammed .\" \u201cAs a business owner, I see the issue from both sides,\u201d added Izzy Goldman of CSS Digital, a computer supply company. \u201cNo matter what the issue, there is never a call to be insulting. What's more, insulting someone is almost a guarantee that your issue will not be addressed properly.\u201d Goldman also suggested starting the conversation with a compliment, such as how you generally enjoy the company\u2019s products or services. That establishes a positive history, which in most cases companies will be eager to continue. Another strategy is to reframe the nature of the complaint. Rather than dealing with a company representative in an accusatory or aggressive manner, simply outline the problem and ask for their assistance: \u201cWho doesn't want to assist someone that specifically asks for help?\u201d said Busse. Ratcheting it up Page 3 of 3 - However diplomatic you may be, an initial effort to reach a reasonable solution to an issue may not render the result you want. If that\u2019s the case, ask to talk with someone higher up in the authority chain. \u201cAlways talk to a decision maker,\u201d said Muntean. Another option is to go as public as possible. While one obvious tactic is to leverage Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social media merely to blast a company and its products, a more subtle and possibly more effective approach is to trust that your posts may catch the attention of sympathetic eyes. \u201cIf everything I try doesn't work, I will take to social media, most often Twitter, and tweet to the company asking for their assistance,\u201d said Busse. \u201cIt's amazing how quickly you can elicit a response when the whole Web is watching. Or the opposite happens and no one responds.\u201d Still another choice is to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Complaints may be submitted online at bbb.org/complain . If the situation warrants it, the BBB also offers mediation and arbitration services. While some issues don\u2019t warrant relentless determination to win, be as persistent as necessary if you feel you\u2019ve been genuinely wronged. Just ask Chris van Greunen, who once spent several months trying to resolve an issue over a single package of rice. Granted, it turned out that there was a dead mouse mixed in with the grains, but van Greunen never lost sight of the underlying principle. \u201cToo many people just leave this kind of situation alone. Shops are seeing that they get away with it nine out of 10 times,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if more of us stand up and fight for our rights then we will be treated with more respect.\u201d", "source": "Flora County Advocate-Press"}
