Pakistan and India teams played in Bangladesh. Even the World Cup cricket was hosted here. It's absolutely a matter of Australia why they suddenly decided not to visit Bangladesh,\" she said. \n\nSheikh Hasina noted that Bangladesh hosted a number of sports events in the past with foolproof security and no untoward incidents happened. \n\n\u00a0\"Untoward incidents have taken place in many countries, but not in Bangladesh ... our law enforcement agencies and all concerned have enough expertise to ensure security of the players and our people are also very much conscious about this,\" she said.", "source": "Financial Express Bangladesh"}
