What makes his performance in \u201cBlack Mass\u201d so outstanding is that he easily hides behind the cold distant eyes of James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger. \n \nAudiences should expect no less from director Scott Cooper, after turning out Woody Harrelson\u2019s most menacing performance in \u201cOut of the Furnace,\u201d but it\u2019s not just Depp that brings his acting A-game to the film \u2014 just about everyone involved follows suit. \n \n\u201cBlack Mass\u201d chronicles the criminal enterprise of Boston\u2019s notorious gangster Whitey Bulger as well as his alliance with friend and FBI agent John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton. The film shows the partnership from both Bulger and Connolly\u2019s sides while they try to justify their actions to their respective peers. \n \nBulger sees the alliance with Connolly as a way to use the FBI to take out any criminal adversaries that he may otherwise be unable to take on himself. Connolly sees a quick route to the top of the FBI chain of command by using his friendship with Bulger as a way to bring him into the informant program, and the film shows that perhaps Connolly is tempted by the outlaw lifestyle as well. One of the only terms of the deal is that Bulger can\u2019t kill anyone, which of course he quickly disregards. \n \nWhat follows is an interesting look at the good and evil present in just about every character as well as shining a spotlight at a not-so-shining moment in the FBI\u2019s history. \n \nCooper drapes the visuals of this gangster film in a \u201970s-era filter and unlike other films which attempt to glamorize thug life, \u201cBlack Mass\u201d does not follow their footsteps. The audience will never truly see Bulger as anything other than a thug, and many times may find themselves doubting his humanity at all given his frightening stare, vampire pale skin and unnerving mannerisms. \n \nHis character brushes nicely against Edgerton\u2019s more affable and weak-willed character in Connolly. When confronted with any sort of negative feedback from peers regarding his treatment of Bulger as an informant, he quickly backs down until he begins receiving actual information he\u2019s quick to rub in everyone\u2019s faces. It\u2019s not until later in the movie, after many a rendezvous with Bulger, that he begins to stand his ground, which ultimately leads to more problems and concerns for the character. \n \nWith the exception of these two characters, the rest of the film acts as a revolving door of supporting characters. All of them expertly act but have very little to do in the larger scheme of the movie. Many have at least one great scene but their characters never seem to formally exit the movie, but instead vanish after serve their purpose like many witnesses to Bulger\u2019s enterprise. \n \nThe film also takes its time explaining a good portion of the start of the FBI alliance but then quickly fast forwards through two scenes that could have used a lot more breathing room for the audience to fully grasp the severity and importance of what happens. The ending is also quickly swept under the rug and Bulger\u2019s fugitive status is only addressed in titles passing by on the screen. \n \nThe film as a whole is highly entertaining and that\u2019s due in large part to the performances of the entire cast. Even though certain characters definitely required more screen time, the overall cast fleshed out the world and made other flaws easy to overlook. It may not be as enjoyable as the more popular gangster movies of the \u201990s, but \u201cBlack Mass\u201d provides a dark and interesting mirror to the films many have grown to love. \n \nBrent Bader is a senior journalism major and a features reporter for The Vidette.
