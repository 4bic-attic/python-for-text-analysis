Mikel told me he would like to play in Turkey because he wants first team football and had it not been for Mourinho pulling out of the move he would have already been at Besiktas. \n \nThere are few, if any, other youngsters in the world whose stock has risen like Pogba's in recent years, with Chelsea sitting as one of the select clubs capable of completing a move of that magnitude. \n \nHowever, a summer of speculation saw Pogba remain in Turin, and Juve chief executive Giuseppe Marotta has since said it could take more than \u20ac100 million (\u00a373 million) to purchase the player, per Sky Sports: \n \nAs we want to win, we have decided to keep hold of a player as important as Pogba, although we have had offers from some very important clubs.\u00a0In the future he could be worth more than 100m euros. \n \nWe've lost the likes of Pirlo, Tevez and Vidal, three irreplaceable players, against our will and replacing them isn't easy.\u00a0Directors, managers and players come and go, but clubs, victories and their successes to come remain.\u00a0It's difficult to do better than last season as that would mean winning the Champions League, but this new Juventus has quality. \n \nWhat we do need to work on is instilling the winning mentality into this new group, because we are Juventus and it's our duty to win both in the present day and in the future. \n \nIt's true that Juventus have found it hard to compete with the pulling power of their fellow European powerhouses, and the wages on offer in Serie A are far below what may be available elsewhere. \n \nAccording to the\u00a0Mirror's David Anderson, Pogba already has a 2016 departure in mind, but he'll be departing for the sunnier climate of Catalonia rather than west London: \n \nI'm surprised Chelsea thought they could get Pogba. Man City tried and took the hint because he seems set on a move to Barca next summer. \n\u2014 David Anderson (@MirrorAnderson) September 1, 2015 \nMourinho has a fine array of midfield talent to choose from at present and it was the central partnership of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic that got last season's title triumph off to such a rampant start. \n \nHowever, the Blues have started this campaign with just one win from their first four games and it appears drastic change will be needed. \n \nThat being said, winter moves are often far more complicated matters thanks to players being cup-tied and the difficulties of signing replacements midseason, making Pogba's January departure hard to imagine. \n \nItalian newspaper\u00a0Tuttosport quoted Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri this week, where he dubbed this \"Pogba's year,\" according to Bleacher Report's Adam Digby, affirming the plans he has in mind for his star: \n \n\"This is Pogba\u2019s year. I never doubted he would stay.\" - another @OfficialAllegri interview, this one w/ @tuttosport pic.twitter.com/7J3694fo18 \n\u2014 Adam Digby (@Adz77) September 3, 2015 \nThe Bianconeri have been difficult to barter with in regards to Pogba thus far, and rightfully so given they hold one of Europe's brightest gems within their ranks, who won Best Young Player at last year's World Cup. \n \nCentral midfield is an area in need of addressing, according to Bleacher Report's Garry Hayes, with fringe figure Mikel one of the more expendable players under Mourinho's command: \n \n...the bench while mediocre replacements (thinking Mikel, Ramires) get game time. Midfield a big area to address after these four games. \n\u2014 Garry Hayes (@garryhayes) August 31, 2015 \nMikel has racked up more than 300 appearances for the Premier League giants since arriving at Chelsea in 2006, but it could be his departure finally opens up the door for a much more substantial replacement. \n \nMany Chelsea fans would swipe at the chance to exchange Pogba for Mikel, but the Blues still have a long way to go before they look like convincing\u00a0Juve to sell the France international.", "source": "DailyNews724.com"}
