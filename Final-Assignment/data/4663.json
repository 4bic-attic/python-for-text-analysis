It is crazy how I have this big dream in my mind but I won't say it. Because if I do, it will always be a dream. I want to dream as big as I want, as crazy as I like. Just let me dream. I feel like it is not impossible for that dream of mine. In fact, I am working towards it. I won't say I am working hard and fast but I am moving towards that dream in tiny steps first. I don't find it too big or crazy. It is something that I want to achieve in my life. Just by achieving this goal. I will feel that I lived my life to the fullest. Of course, to make this dream work, I really have to work hard in my game. Push myself even further. Everyday, I go to work with a heavy heart because maybe I am not doing what I truly love. I enjoy the job but I do not have much knowledge or stand afterall, I am the youngest full-timer here.\u00a0 I do want to make a point here at work but at the same time, I do not want to irritate the people around me. Work is hard!\u00a0 Well, at least I got people around that supports me and are here in my life! I am truly grateful for them especially my boyfriend!", "source": "\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2"}
