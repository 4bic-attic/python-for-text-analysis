Noack as a Board member. \n      \nMCHD Chief Executive Officer Randy Chief said Noack will replace former County Judge Alan Sadler on the board. He said the members also approved the 2015-2016 Board budget. \n \n\u201cOur expenses went down about 36 percent,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brett Allen said. \u201cWe have a budgeted surplus of about $416,000.\u201d \n \nAllen said about 75 percent of the revenue is derived from the Medicaid 1115 Waiver that is funding the community paramedicine program. The decrease in expenses is a result of closing two of the Public Health District\u2019s waiver programs. \n \n\u201cWe had three programs last year, the navigator, community paramedicine, and health and wellness,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAs we went along, we really saw the navigator program as being duplicative with our community paramedicine program.\u201d \n \nThe navigation program \u201cfocuses on reaching out to the underserved and providing the necessary link to healthcare services, as well as assist in securing a medical home for them,\u201d according to the MCHD website. \n \nTo prevent the overlap, the CFO said the district rolled the navigation and paramedicine programs together. He said no jobs or services will be lost. \n \n\u201cRather than getting funding separately for those from the state, we rolled those together, closed the program,\u201d he said. \u201cThat relieves the state the burden of having to match funding with us. That was in our mind a good thing and being a good steward of those dollars.\u201d \n \nAllen said the state was impressed that the Board was being \u201cgood stewards\u201d with the funds. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve now come back and given us some options on some additional projects,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen how successful the community paramedics program is, so we are looking at some options and we will come up with some recommendations for some projects that would be of value to the community.\u201d \n \nDetails were not immediately available as the projects are still in the discussion phase.", "source": "Houston Villager"}
