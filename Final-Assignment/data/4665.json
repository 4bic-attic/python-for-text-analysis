Maybe a third of the room said so. Whether that number increased by the end of the session, I don\u2019t know, but I would certainly like to think so.\r\u00a0\rOne of the attendees was Gregoire Letort, CPO of Electrolux, and someone who \u2018gets\u2019 the whole SEI concept. He said that a key driver of SEI at his organisation was competitive pressures from Asia, combined with the fact that his suppliers were spending proportionally more on R&D than Electrolux itself. It would be crazy not to tap into that resource, he said.\r\u00a0\rWithout going into detail on how Electrolux does that (you can read about how the company structures SEI and works with open innovation and R&D here) I thought it was worth pulling out just one aspect of the SEI process at Electrolux \u2013 how it guarantees a focused approach to idea generation and new business proposals.\r\u00a0\r\u201cIt comes from two angles \u2013 one is the consumer and marketing one, where we look at megatrends and consumer-useful features,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd the other one is the R&D and technology angle, where we are focusing on the roadmap for the technologies we want to work on for the future. The key really is to narrow a little bit which technology you want to focus on.\u201d\r\u00a0\rThis focus allows Electrolux to then select a reasonable number of suppliers for input and proposals, and means that its foray into the world of universities, start-ups and even individual inventors is both targeted and efficient.\r\u00a0\rOne example of pure SEI that has come through the Electrolux programme is a newly developed \u201ceasy lift dish\u201d for its dish washers, which uses a mechanism attached to the lower drawer that brings it to the height of the upper drawer when it is pulled out of the washing machine, for easier loading and unloading. The product will launch early next year, with the solution having already been revealed to the trade.\r\u00a0\rWhat\u2019s great about this example is that the mechanism didn\u2019t come from a supplier serving the relevant category, but from a different supplier that was only given the opportunity to work on the project because Electrolux\u2019s innovation programme is in place.\r\u00a0\rIt\u2019s a clear example of SEI delivering tangible value to an organisation \u2013 and for procurement, that is surely where we want to be.\r\u00a0\rFind more blogs on Supplier-Enabled Innovation (SEI) at our Ovation site.
