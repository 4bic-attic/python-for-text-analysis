It seems like the Coopers boys set out from shore to go on a serious salmon fishing mission with a 303 in the bag and this became the result. \n \nOn the other hand, \u2018Ixam\u2019 is one ferocious, beaver teeth grinding jam, in ecstatic analogue delirium. Think earlier Mono Junk darkness and you should get an idea, where this is heading. Gloom\u2019n\u2019Glory surely seems like an appropriate description here. \n \n\u2018Maximalfun\u2019 aka a 12:34 minutes restrained roller coaster ride with endless, repetitive sonic musters completes the mental clusterfuck and I expect to see at least a good number of dingy ravers in spasmodic state, getting killed slowly by this. If not, the the sun will do the job. \n \nWith love from Finland! \n Tweet", "source": "BITCHSLAP MAGAZINE COPENHAGEN"}
