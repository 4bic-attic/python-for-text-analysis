The 26 year old Mnisi, takes over the captaincy duties from Warren Whiteley, who was expected to lead the team upon his arrival from the Springboks,but was ruled out after he sustained a calf injury. The former Pumas centre Mnisi says he is excited to be given the captaincy role and he does not see his appointment as a result of the hotly debated transformation issue in the sport. \u201cWith all the talk around transformation, I can't get swept up in that. I need to focus on the team and play well,\u201d Mnisi said. Mnisi sentiments were echoed by his coach Ackermann, who stated that the appointment of Mnisi had nothing to do with transformation as he treats his players with the same respect. \u201cMy players are chosen on merit, I'm proud to say that. Howard is my captain because of how he has been playing,\u201d Ackermann said. Lions host EP Kings brimming with confidence, following their bonus point victory over Pumas in their last match and Ackermann has maintained they will continue with the same performances against seventh placed EP Kings side. \u201cWe sympathise with the Kings, but we need to prepare regardless. On the field it's all business and we can't let that affect us. We need to carry on as usual. The 45 year-old Ackermann has retained most of the players that did the business against Pumas last week, with Fabian Booysen shifting to No.8 to take Whiteley's place, while Kwagga Smith has been given a starting berth and Andries Coetzee starts at number 15. \u201cIt's great to have Andries Coetzee back at 15. He's an experienced player who brings stability and confidence.\u201d The Johannesburg based outfit are currently topping the log with 20 points, tight with rivals Blue Bulls and they are firm favourites to win this clash against win-less Eastern Province based outfit.", "source": "The New Age Online"}
