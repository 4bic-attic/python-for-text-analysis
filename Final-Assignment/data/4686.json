To end the game like that is obviously a great feeling,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThe Sugar Bowl was nice and sweet, but to be the one to end the game had a lot more meaning to it.\u201d \n \nThe route North ran was one Sanchez and the defense saw all week. The junior cornerback credited the scout team for preparing Oklahoma\u2019s secondary for the Vols\u2019 passing game. \n \nThe Sooner defense wasn\u2019t always in a position to help OU win last season, however. \n \nThey held off Tennessee\u2019s offense Saturday while Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma\u2019s offensive attack slowly found its groove, but junior linebacker Dominique Alexander knows the defense didn\u2019t play as well it was supposed to a season ago. \n \n\u201cWe got a lot of bad talk last year,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not putting it out there on the turf, anybody can say what they want. But we\u2019ve been putting it out there on the turf and that\u2019s why the stories have been changing.\u201d \n \nOklahoma\u2019s pass defense ranks second-best in pass completion percentage against and sixth in passing yards allowed. Last year, it ranked 44 th and 120 th in those categories respectively. \n \nThe players aren\u2019t oblivious to the criticism. However, they\u2019re working to change their perception with being on the same page and create more consistency. \n \n\u201cWe knew what we\u2019re capable of,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cObviously we have to get better every week. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve been stressing; never get too high, never get too low. As high as you can get. You can get low real fast. You can get humbled real quick.\u201d \n \nSanchez feels the defense is competing more as a whole, and they\u2019re ready to showcase it. \n \nHe even says there\u2019s a new swagger to Oklahoma football. \n \n\u201cI think it started in the offseason,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe knew we had a lot of work to do. We put in a lot of work. When you get talked bad about for nine months, it\u2019s always fun to come out and shut people up as much as you can.\u201d \n \nSenior Charles Tapper likes the position his team is in as an underdog. \n \nHe said OU was in the same spot when he was a sophomore, and he\u2019s ready to do the same this season. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re slept on,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cWe want to be under the radar. We don\u2019t want to be the spotlight team. As the season goes on, we want to get there. We\u2019re going to start from the bottom and show that Sooner Magic that we have.\u201d", "source": "Oklahoma Daily"}
