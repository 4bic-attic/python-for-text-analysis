When the case was filed in 2012, 78 prisoners had been held\u00a0in isolation for more than 20 years, with\u00a0500 of them held for over\u00a010 years. \n \nPrisoners were often put in solitary solely because of gang affiliations, not based on any behavioral reasons. The prisoners had argued that being held in isolation had caused \u201csevere physical and psychological harm,\u201d according to the\u00a0Center For Constitutional Rights, which helped argue their case. \n \nThe agreement filed\u00a0Tuesday \u00a0will replace\u00a0indeterminate stays in solitary confinement with a more robust behavior-based infraction system. Prisoners\u00a0found guilty of serious offenses while incarcerated will serve a fixed term in insolation, and enter a two-year step-down program before returning to general population. \n \nHowever, most prisoners found to be not guilty of solitary-eligible offenses within the previous two years, which include murder and weapons possession, will be immediately released into general population within one year. \n \nThe Center For Constitutional Rights told Vocativ almost 10,000 prisoners remain under some form of isolation in California state prisons today. However, the state corrections office said that number is closer to 6,400. \n \nAs part of the case, six Pelican Bay prisoners filed depositions in which they described the effects of living in solitary confinement, some of them for as many as 25 years, excerpts from which are featured below. \n Gabriel Reyes: 17 years in solitary confinement  \nReyes\u00a0(49),\u00a0from\u00a0Palmdale, California , who was placed in solitary confinement after being identified as a member of\u00a0a Mexican mafia prison gang, said he begun hearing voices in his head. \u201cSometimes when I hear my name being called, I may yell out to my neighbor and ask him if he heard somebody call me. And when he says no, I mean, it\u2019s kind of humiliating.\u201d \n Todd Ashker: 22 years in solitary confinement  \nAshker (51), who received a GED and associates degree in paralegal studies while incarcerated, and was a\u00a0lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit ,\u00a0claimed: \u201cI\u2019ve been basically forced to withdraw from being any type of normal social human being, through my incarceration in the Security Housing Unit (SHU).\u201d \n George Franco: 23 years in solitary confinement  \nFranco (49) said \u201cyou ain\u2019t really get no counseling\u201d which encouraged him to \u201chold everything inside.\u201d He said in his deposition in July : \u201cIf you let it all out\u2026you\u2019re going to get in trouble and end up hurting somebody. So you just keep it all inside. That\u2019s not supposed to be healthy\u2026for a person\u2026to be holding everything in.\u201d \n Jeffrey Franklin:\u00a023 years in solitary confinement  \n\u201cThe food we get is terrible. It is not enough. It is often cold and served on dirty, disgusting trays. Hardly a fresh vegetable or piece of fruit,\u201d said\u00a0Franklin (55), from New Orleans , adding in finer detail: \u201cWe had canned fruit at breakfast and I guess it was some type of\u2026looked like tangerines or something like that. Well I ate it and when I went out to the yard\u2026it all came right back up. It didn\u2019t take right with my system.\u201d \n Paul Redd: 14 years in solitary confinement  \nRedd claimed being held in isolation had resulted\u00a0in violent thoughts . Complaining of short and long-term memory loss, Redd\u00a0said before being placed in solitary confinement: \u201cI never had thoughts that a cop may come to work uncontrolled, might just be mad and go postal and just start shooting all of us in our cell.\u00a0You know, I never used to have them kind of thoughts.\u201d \n Ronnie N. Dewberry: 25 years in solitary confinement  \nDewberry (57) said that despite suffering from chronic lower back problems and pain, stomach problems and swollen thyroid glands, he tells family members \u201cnot to worry about me.\u201d He said in his deposition : \u201cMy family members, like any other family members, worry about their sons and daughters in prison. I am no different. I try to protect my family from the harsh treatment that one receives here.\u201d", "source": "Vocativ"}
