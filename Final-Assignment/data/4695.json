She stood on the brink of obscurity after the scandal but battled back to have a successful career in music and television. \n\nIn today's society, nudity is much more common for celebrities and is often celebrated. From Kim Kardashian's \"breaking the Internet\" in 2014 with her nude photo spread in Paper magazine to Sharon Stone's more recent baring it all in Harper's Bazaar, there seems to be hardly anyone left who hasn't stripped down. \n\nSome argue that Kardashian wouldn't even be famous were it not for her appearance in a sex tape, and most actors barely blink an eye at doing nude scenes in movies or in magazines. \n\nRelationship expert Kimberly Moffit told Fox that baring it all can have a positive effect. \n\n\"Some psychological benefits of posing nude can include a feeling of empowerment, increased confidence and body image, and an overall feeling of pride,\" she said. \"Women, like Sharon Stone, may pose nude to feel empowered and in control of their bodies, especially if they are proud of the way it looks or confident in who they are as a person. Some women take pride in demonstrating to other women that all body types are beautiful and that beauty can take form in many ways.\" \n\nSocial media has also helped. \n\nThose who follow Justin Bieber on Instagram were recently treated to a shot of a totally nude Biebs from the back. Comic and late-night talk show host Chelsea Handler has posted topless photos of herself on the social media\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
