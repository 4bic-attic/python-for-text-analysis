He says he hasn't had to raise his prices by much yet, but worries he will soon. \"If it stays the way that it is, there will be some price increases next year, and it will be affecting our business then.\"\u00a0 \n \nThe loonie continues to hover around 75-cents U.S.- some of the lowest marks seen in a decade. Retailers who buy most of their inventory in the United Sates will feel the pinch the most. \n \nThis could also make traveling to the United States to shop more expensive. \n \n\"I went shopping in the States with a few girlfriends a few months ago and it wasn't worth it, we almost ended up spending more than if we had just stayed in Canada,\" says Leslie Morrow. \n \nUniversity of Ottawa professor Michael Mulvey says the effects of the low dollar will be widespread. \"I think it is going to effect everyone - it's going to be across the board. All consumer goods particularly those that are manufactured and imported goods via the U.S. You are going to see an uptake in prices,\" he says.\u00a0 \n \nChris Torti is trying to be optimistic and see an upside to a low loonie. \"In a way the low dollar can totally help us - we are now the place Americans can shop online or travel over to and spend money in Canada where it was the flip side last year.\"", "source": "CTV News"}
