Harvest is under way in the mid-South and a few parts of the Midwest, including top states Illinois and Iowa, brokers said. \n \n\u201cThe yield reports that have been coming through on beans (are) generally looking better than they have on corn,\u201d said Rich Feltes, vice president for research with R.J. O\u2019Brien. \n \nForecasts called for mostly dry weather next week and for the rest of the month, with no frost, Feltes noted, which should help crops to mature and promote fieldwork. \n \nCash soybean values have been falling in the Midwest this week as processors brace for the influx of new-crop supplies. \n \nAlso bearish were early prospects for record-large crops out of South America, where farmers are planting. Brazilian analyst Safras + Mercado raised its forecast for the country\u2019s 2015-16 soybean crop to a record 100.54 million tonnes, from 99.3 million in July. \n \n\u201cMost of the big-picture stuff is pretty negative,\u201d said Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain, Chicago brokerage. \n \nCorn followed soybeans lower on seasonal U.S. harvest pressure and sluggish export demand. \n \nWheat futures climbed on what appeared to be fund short covering. Commodity funds hold a net short position in CBOT wheat, leaving the market open to short-covering rallies. But ample world wheat supplies hang over the market. \n \nUnderscoring strong competition for exports, a wheat tender from Egypt\u2019s General Authority for Supply Commodities attracted offers of about 945,000 tonnes from the Black Sea region and France. No U.S. wheat was offered. \n \nEgypt bought a total of 230,000 tonnes of Ukrainian, Russian and French wheat. \n \n\u2014 Julie Ingwersen is a Reuters correspondent covering grain markets from Chicago.
