Jay Nixon to take a wide look at all the issues that many believe have contributed to tensions between police and the communities they serve. \nSixteen  \"diverse volunteer leaders\" have now produced what they call \"an unflinching report\" that offers \"specific, practical policy recommendations.\" \n\nThe report calls on police departments to decrease their use of force, saying the state's attorney general should be put in charge of all investigations involving allegations of excessive force. \n\nIndeed, state authorities should lead the probes of all cases of force that end in death, says the commission, whose conclusions were first reported by NPR and the St. Louis Dispatch.", "source": "WTVD Raleigh Durham"}
