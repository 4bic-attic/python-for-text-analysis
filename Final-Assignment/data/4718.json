I wanted to thank Mother Earth for the bountiful produce, stunning flowers and all the musical chirping of the birds that came to visit our backyard.\u00a0 So I made a Mandala\u00a0with whatever remains in my garden. Cooler mornings with the hummingbirds returning south and the call of blue jays getting louder, I can feel fall in the air. I made a delicate twine garland to welcome the season. Whimsical arrangements and stylings are fun.\u00a0 I draw great inspiration from nature. She never disappoints. Nature-inspired seasonal garland to adorn entrances, windows and fireplaces. \u00a0I had few dried roses and hydrangea that I added to the garland.\nA warm hued colour palette. Deep browns of pinecones, dried natures treasures, brass bells and a twine.\nHydrangeas dry beautifully on the bush, I brought few big ones inside. Just grateful to be surrounded by such beauty of nature.\nHave a great day and enjoy the season in transition!\n(Images by Arch and are copyrighted)", "source": "Rang-Decor {Interior Ideas predominantly Indian}"}
