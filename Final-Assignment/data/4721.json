People it seems around here think that they are in the stores for their taking, to take items to their homes and just dump them all over. I have known neighbors around here in the past that have done this their is currently a Dollar Store one at the corner of Washington & Jackson that has been there for 2 days incase the store is interested. Is there something that can be done about the returning of these, either by the stores when notified, and perhaps when the police see them being used have a fine for those thieves, it could generate $ for the police dept and remove one more blight item one at a time.", "source": "Salisbury News"}
