To help combat the issue, AFD, AIPC & SK Alaska announced today its participation in Child Passenger Safety Week, a campaign dedicated to helping parents and caregivers make sure their children ride as safely as possible, every trip, every time. Child Passenger Safety Week runs September 13-19 and is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). \n\r\n\r \n\u201cEvery 34 seconds a child under the age of 13 is involved in a crash,\u201d said Seethaler \u201cUsing car seats that are age- and size-appropriate is the best way to keep your child safe.\u201d Motor vehicle crashes are a leading killer of children. Car seats, booster seats, and seat belts, she said, can make all the difference. \u201cIn 2013, 263 children under age 5 were saved because they were in child restraints. Cars seats matter, and having the right car seat installed and used the right way is critical.\u201d \n\r\n\r \nShe added that too often, parents move their children to the front seat before they should, which increases the risk of injury and death. The safest place for all kids under 13 is in the back seat of the car. Also, according to NHTSA, about 24 percent of children ages 4 to 7 (who should be riding in booster seats), were prematurely moved to seat belts, and 9 percent were unrestrained altogether. \n\r\n\r \n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to keep our children safe,\u201d She stressed. \u201cGet your car seats checked. Make certain they\u2019re installed correctly, that your kids are in the right seat and are buckled in the right way. Even if you think your child is safe, check again, so you can be sure that your child is the safest he or she can be while traveling. According to NHTSA, 59 percent of car seats are misused.\u201d \n\r\n\r \nNHTSA recommends keeping children rear-facing as long as possible up to the top height or weight allowed by their particular seats. Once a child outgrows the rear-facing only \u201cinfant\u201d car seat, he/she should travel in a rear-facing \u201cconvertible\u201d or all-in-one car seat. Once your child outgrows the rear-facing size limits, he or she is ready to travel in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether. After outgrowing the forward-facing car seats, children should be placed in booster seats until they\u2019re the right size to use seat belts safely. \n\r\n\r \nAlways remember to register your car seat and booster seat with the car seat manufacturer so you can be notified in the event of a recall.
