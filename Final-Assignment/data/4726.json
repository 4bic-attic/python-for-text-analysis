JSU was also ranked No. 2 on October 25, 2010 and the following week of November 1, 2010. \n \nDuring the Gamecocks' Division II days where the Gamecocks won the 1992 NCAA National Championship, JSU was ranked No. 2 on 10 different occasions, but never held the top spot. \n \n\"Polls are polls,\" said JSU head coach John Grass. \"They really don't mean much. We're thinking about the OVC and working toward getting a bye in the first round (of the playoffs) and a home game in the second round.\" \n \nJax State received 553 points and is ranked No. 4 in the FCS Coaches Poll, just behind Coastal Carolina (620), North Dakota State (592) and Villanova (574). \n \nThe most recent OVC team to be ranked No. 1 was Tennessee State in the final poll of 1999. \n \nJSU opens its home and OVC schedules on Saturday at 1 p.m. at Burgess-Snow Field against Tennessee State. It will be Band Day, Cage The Tigers and Red Out on campus. Fans are encouraged to wear red and purchase their tickets in advance. If purchased online in advance, general admission tickets are $10, while they are $15 if purchased in the ticket office or at the gate on game day. \n \nFCS STATS POLL \n \nRank School Votes Prev \n \n1.
