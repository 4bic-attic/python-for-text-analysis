The government projects growth of about 5 per cent this fiscal year, compared with estimated growth of 4.2 per cent in 2014/15. \n\nAnnual inflation accelerated after the government slashed subsidies last year but has since been slowing. It dropped for the third consecutive month in August to its lowest level in more than two years, with urban consumer inflation dropping to 7.9 per cent in August. \n\nThe overnight deposit rate stayed at 8.75 per cent and the overnight lending rate was held at 9.75 per cent, the bank said in a statement. \n\n(gulftoday)", "source": "Egypt Commercial News"}
