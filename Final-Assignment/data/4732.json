The well-being of our planet and its people are at the heart of the new goals. \n\nThey point the way towards greater prosperity and equality and will ensure more robust and sustainable economic growth, the leaders said. \n\nIn July this year, at a Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa, the institutions unveiled plans to scale up their finance and support for countries seeking to achieve the development goals, pledging to increase their financial contribution to more than $400 billion over the next three years. \n\nThey vowed to examine how they could increase their own financing and also to work to ensure a greater mobilization of domestic resources and expanded funding from the private sector.", "source": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha"}
