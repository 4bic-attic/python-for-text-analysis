Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick told Chinese news website Sina that it had raised $US1.2 billion ($1.7bn) so far from investors for its China unit, including an additional investment from strategic partner Baidu.\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman confirmed the comments but declined to say how much Baidu invested in this round. A Baidu spokesman also confirmed the investment, declining to give a sum.\n\nDidi Kuaidi is approaching a \u201csecond closing\u201d that would raise an additional $US1bn, after bringing in $US2bn in July, two sources said. The combined $US3bn fundraising round could be the largest ever by a tech start-up.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported that Uber China was closing in on a $US1bn funding round that would value the Chinese business at about $US7.5bn, and that Didi Kuaidi was raising further funding that could reach $US1bn.\n\nBaidu first invested in Uber at the end of December and has not disclosed the size of its investment.", "source": "The Australian"}
