Eventually, the inflation slackened to 3.6\nas of late August.\u00a0 There is still slow\nupward trend in the global economy and deflation in the international commodity\nmarkets.\u00a0 In this light, the Armenian\nCentral Bank Council anticipates no influence on inflation from the external\nsector within the coming months. \n \nAccording\nto the Central Bank, in Q2 the economic activity rate was higher than\nanticipated due to supply factors. The stimulating fiscal policy helped\ncertainly restore the domestic demand and partially neutralize deflation\nenvironment. As volatility grows in the world financial and foreign exchange\nmarkets, inflation expectations are relatively high. In this light, the CB\nconsiders it unreasonable to maintain the fiscal terms.\u00a0 Due to it, by the end of the year, the\n12-month inflation will decrease to the minimum permissible limit.\u00a0 Such fiscal policy will allow not only\nreducing the inflation expectations, but also suspending them within the near\nfuture to achieve the mid-term target. \n \nTo recall, on Augu 11, the Central Bank of Armenia\nreduced the refinancing rate by 0.25pp from 10.5% to 10.25% at its August 11\nmeeting, the press- office of the Central Bank told ArmInfo.\u00a0 According to the source, the CB's rate on\nLombard REPOs was reduced from 14.5% to 11.75%, while the deposit rate was\nreduced from 9% to 8.75%.\u00a0 At the June\n24 session, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia took a decision to retain\nthe refinancing rate at 10.5%.\u00a0 On Feb\n10, 2015, the CB raised the refinancing rate from 9.5% to 10.5%, at the same\ntime reducing the lombard repo rate from 17% to 14.5% and raising the deposit\nrate from 5.25% to 9%.
