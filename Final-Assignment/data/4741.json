Yet despite the cruelty at the hands of Libyan smugglers, despite the suffering that was inflicted upon them by their own government that forced them to flee for their lives, Mahmoud\u2019s family and other Syrian refugees I met still view Israel as their real enemy.\r \r \n \n\u201cFirst of all I respect all religions, including Judaism\u2026 In Syria we have all races and religions living together, we are all brothers\u2026 but Israel, Israel is the ultimate enemy, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told since we were kids,\u201d said baby Mahmud\u2019s cousin Adman, 21, who studied tourism in Syria. \u201cBut I want to stress something: Jews are not my enemy. Zionists are my enemy.\u201d \n \nAdman was surprised that he was being interviewed by a Jewish reporter, and, more so, for an Israeli newspaper. \n \nHe jumped. \n \n\u201cWow, I\u2019m almost shaking. I\u2019ve never met a Jew before,\u201d he said and paused. \u201cWhy would an Israeli paper be interested in stories about Syrian refugees,\u201d he asked. \n \nTwo-year-old Mahmoud sleeps on a pillow in a Milan shelter after fleeing Damascus a month ago with his parents and relatives. (Rossella Tercatin/The Times of Israel) \n \nHe was amazed after I told him about the current debates in Israel concerning the absorption of refugees from Syria, and how the Israeli military was treating wounded Syrians in makeshift field hospitals near the border. \n \nDespite his surprise and interest, he still warned me not tell the other refugees that I was Jewish. \u201cSome of them could react badly,\u201d he said. \n \nSitting with her parents and brother, Mais, 21, is another refugee from Syria whose family also harbors strong resentment towards Israel. \n \n\u2018Israel is a colonial power, that\u2019s it. They stole the Palestinian\u2019s land\u2019 \n \n\u201cIsrael is a colonial power, that\u2019s it. They stole the Palestinians\u2019 land,\u201d her mother Inaia was quick to respond when asked her thoughts on the subject. \n \nBeneath her bright purple headscarf, Mais smiles sweetly, looking a bit tired, but relieved that the horrific journey from Syria was behind her. \n \n\u201cOur house was bombarded three times and the road my brother and I used to take to go to university does not exist any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no future in Syria.\u201d \n \nMais\u2019s family tried fleeing to Egypt two years ago but without success. \n \n\u201cWe wanted to be in a fellow Arab country, we felt it was important. But they treated us extremely badly,\u201d explained her father Imad, who worked in olive production back home in Idlib. \u201cWe could not work, we could not do anything.\u201d \n Lending a helping hand  \nAs the night goes on, many refugees leave for designated shelters. Each are provided with a bright orange cloth bag of toiletries and other basic goods from donors and organizations. \n \nTwenty-eight-year-old Rima works for one of those organizations \u2014 Arca, the Italian NGO, which was chosen by Milan\u2019s municipality to run the migrant registration facility. Since 2013, Arca has registered and assisted about 87,000 migrants, most of them Syrians and Eritreans. \n \nTwenty-eight-year-old Rima registers an Eritrean migrant. Rima works for Arca, the Italian NGO which was chosen by Milan\u2019s municipality to run the migrant registration facility. (Rossella Tercatin/The Times of Israel) \n \nRima moved to Italy from Syria in 2004 with her family but moved back to Syria in 2009 because of the economic crisis. With the start of the Syrian civil war, they moved yet again to Italy. \n \nRima is a veteran at the center. She registers the migrants, jokes with them, listens to their requests, translates, talks on the phone and organizes their accommodations for the night in one of the several shelters set up in the city. \n \n\u201cSince the beginning of the war I have lost an uncle, some cousins, a baby nephew. This is why working in this center for me is so important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I can do for my people. Everyone here could be my family. Their pain is my pain.\u201d \n \n\u2018For Syrians, Israel is Palestinian territory. Palestinians are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors\u2019 \n \nWhen she finds out that I am interested in understanding what Syrians think about Israel, she hesitates but is willing to engage. \n \n\u201cFor Syrians, Israel is Palestinian territory,\u201d she explained. \u201cPalestinians are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors, because a lot of them flee to Syria. My paternal grandmother is Palestinian, she left Haifa in 1948, when she was 10.\u201d \n \nBut, she insisted that she isn\u2019t in any way against Jews. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s written in the Quran, we must respect Jews,\u201d she said. \n \nAsked about her perspective on the war in Syria, she says that the war will end when Russia and Iran will stop giving arms to the regime, and America will decide that they have had enough. \n Acknowledging the Holocaust  \nOnly a few hundred feet away from the shelter providing temporary refuge for the migrants is Milan\u2019s Holocaust Memorial. So, it is only natural for the Holocaust to come up in conversation. \n \n\u201cI know about the Holocaust and when I was in Italy I always took part in the ceremonies for [Holocaust] Memorial Day at school. It was terrible,\u201d said Rima. \u201cIn Syria, we don\u2019t study it in the same way, it\u2019s only a couple of lines of the textbooks. That is why I wanted to find out more about it, and I saw some movies on the topic, like \u2018The Pianist.'\u201d \n \nHowever, when asked if she would be willing to read or explore different perspectives on Middle East issues and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, she simply said, \u201cNot really, I don\u2019t read too much.\u201d \n \nA similar reaction arose when I brought up the possibility of a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Jews should have a state. They are a religion, not a people,\u201d Rima explained. \u201cThey can be Syrian Jews, German Jews, Italian Jews. But I don\u2019t think a Jewish state has any reason to exist.\u201d \n \nMoroccan immigrant Adil Khabi has lived in Italy for the past 13 years. Today he volunteers at Milan\u2019s Holocaust Memorial where he is pictured on June 22, 2015 against its Wall of Indifference, to help with the African refugees sheltered there.
