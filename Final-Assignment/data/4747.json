(WXYZ) - The security video shows the spectacular high speed crash.\u00a0 \n\n\"Through the debris it looked like a stunt movie,\" said Stephen Bermudez, who was on the job in Southgate with a co-worker early Tuesday morning.\u00a0 \n\n\"With the smoke, the car was running through it and we just seen it go up in the air,\" Bermudez\u00a0said of the accident that occurred next to the Speedy Quick Mart on Dix Toledo Highway.\u00a0 \n\nSecurity camera video shows the driver, a 30-year-old Southgate resident, traveling northbound on Dix Toledo road. According to police, witnesses said the man had to be going 70 miles per hour when he lost control on the curve at Northline Road. \n \n\"I guess, when it hit, it it went up like a ramp and went nose first and when it hit the nose, it flipped up and that's what hit the building, the rear end of the car,\" said Bermudez.\u00a0 \n\nThe tow truck parked in front of Motor City Auto Care was totaled by the impact. The building also suffered significant damage. \n\nWhen police and fire responded they discovered the man still pinned inside the vehicle. \n\n\"They finally pried the door open and got him out and they were just shocked that he was able to walk away from that impact,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\nThe man was eventually transported to the hospital. Police tell 7 Action News his injuries are not life-threatening. \n\nTheir\u00a0investigation will determine\u00a0whether the man had been drinking or if there was another explanation for the spectacular crash.", "source": "WXYZ"}
