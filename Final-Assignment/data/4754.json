The staff said they had trouble here Friday night and guys in a white four-wheel-drive had come here and run over the wombats.\n\n\u201cSaturday night we went to bed and about 11pm. I heard screaming and a car being driven very loudly.\n\n\u201cI heard a man screaming stop, he was trying to get the keys off the driver to stop them from driving. \n\n\u201cThey had all been drinking very heavily and I heard the car take off up the road. \n\n\u201cI watched through the window of the tent and I saw a male driving a car off the road onto the grass where the campers were. I saw the headlights of the car change direction dramatically in which he did a doughnut and collided with the tree. \n\n\u201cHe continued back down the road and I heard the thump when he hit a wombat. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been coming here about 15 years and have never seen anything like this before. The wombats are quiet and come right up to the campsites. It\u2019s very distressing to see people do that.\n\n\u201cI was concerned for my safety, my family\u2019s safety and everybody else\u2019s safety. It was very confronting,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice are now investigating the deaths of 13 wombats.\n\nOn Friday night eight wombats were killed with campers waking to find their bodies scattered around the popular family camping site.\n\nAnother body was found three kilometres away on Jacks Corner Road on the lawn outside the Kangaroo Valley Pumping and Power Station.\n\nOn Sunday morning a further two dead wombats carrying joeys were found dead on the campsite lawn.\n\nSecurity personnel were on site performing vehicle checks on Sunday which is normal protocol for the holiday period.\n\nPolice are being supported by NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and Sydney Water Authority in their investigation.\n\nSouth Coast Register, NSW", "source": "Coly Point Observer"}
