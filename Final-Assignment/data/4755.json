Four days since Peter Sagan was hit by a neutral assistance motorcycle, Sergio Paulinho was hit by a TV motorbike and forced to abandon stage 11. I watched today's stage and saw the above image on Twitter and first winced and fell into disbelief that another reckless motorcycle incident has reared it's ugly head. A shame that Paulinho and Sagan are gone and race organizers are now committed to positively react before some rider really gets hurt. Tinkoff-Saxo post.
