The chase began after Angulo was spotted by police getting on the Maine Turnpike near Exit 19 heading north. \n\nAfter an officer attempted to pull him over, Angulo sped away. He got off the turnpike at Exit 32 and started heading toward Alfred on Route 111. He evaded tire-deflating device that police had set up but eventually stopped near Day Road in Lyman. \n\nBecause of the previous domestic violence charge, Angulo is being held without bail at the York County Jail. He is expected in court in October.", "source": "WMTW"}
