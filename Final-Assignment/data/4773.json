There\u2019s just no other way\u00a0to describe\u00a0it than a miracle. \n \nHowever, when a person remains brain dead or on life support for such a long time, it can be easy for people to lose hope and even question if the person suffering would be better off letting go. That\u2019s exactly what happened after 12-year-old Martin Pistorius of South Africa suddenly fell ill and was diagnosed with a degenerative illness, leaving him in a vegetative state. \n \nFor 12 long years, Pistorius became trapped inside his own body. He\u00a0believes he woke up around 14 or 15 years old, but everyone around him thought he was completely unconscious to the world around him. He even overheard his mother say she wished he was dead, but knew she was heartbroken seeing her son lay there, silently suffering. \n \nIn the following powerful NBC interview, we learn what life was like for Pistorius, trapped with his thoughts for over a decade. \n \nPlease SHARE this man\u2019s remarkable story with all of your friends on Facebook. \n \nThe post Man Wakes Up From A 10-Year Coma And Reveals This Chilling Secret appeared first on LittleThings.com .", "source": "LittleThings.com"}
