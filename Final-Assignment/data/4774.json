Secretarial Audit is a process to check compliance with the provisions of various laws and rules/regulations/procedures, maintenance of books, records etc., by an independent professional to ensure that the company has complied with the legal and procedural requirements and also followed due processes. It is essentially a mechanism to monitor compliance with the requirements of stated laws and processes. Which companies are required to undergo Secretarial Audit? As per section 204(1) of Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 9 of the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014, the following companies are required to obtain Secretarial Audit Report: \u2013 Every listed company; or Every public company having a paid-up share capital of fifty crore rupees or more; or Every public company* having a turnover of two hundred fifty crore rupees or more. *Public Company includes a private company which is a subsidiary of a public company. (My view: However, it is recommended that it should be adopted voluntarily. It can be an effective multi-pronged weapon to assure the regulator, generate confidence amongst the shareholders, the creditors and other stakeholders in companies, assure FIIs/FIs/SFCs/SIDCs/Banks and instill self regulation and professional discipline in companies. It is a tool of risk mitigation and will allow companies to effectively address compliance risk issues. It helps the companies to build their corporate image. Secretarial Audit thus provides necessary comfort to the management, regulators and the stakeholders, as to the statutory compliance, good governance and the existence of proper and adequate systems and processes.) Who can conduct Secretarial Audit? Only a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India holding certificate of practice (company secretary in practice) can conduct Secretarial Audit and furnish the Secretarial Audit Report to the company.
