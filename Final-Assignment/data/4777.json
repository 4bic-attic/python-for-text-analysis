Stephen Colbert is back in the game and this time, he\u2019s playing himself. The Late Show host made his debut Tuesday night in good old American fashion\u2014by singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Joined by friends from all over New York City, the beloved TV personality\u00a0performed the tune in a bowling alley, in front of a field, by a water fountain, and even on a baseball field. And he was joined by a very special guest: Jon Stewart!\rThe last time we saw these two together, it was during an emotional send off as Colbert said goodbye to The Colbert Report. And in true Colbert fashion, he made everyone laugh while delivering an eloquent speech. \"Here's the thing, Jon,\" he said, according to E! Online. \"You said to me and many other people to never thank you because we owe you nothing. It is one of the few times I've known you to be dead wrong. We owe\u00a0 you\u2014and not just what you did for our career by employing us to come on this tremendous show that you made\u2014we owe you because we learned from you. We learned from you by example how to do a show with intention, how to work with clarity, how to treat people with respect. You were infuriatingly good at your job.\"\rDamn you both for being infuriatingly good at your jobs.", "source": "all"}
