It\u00a0was not confined to just the physical effects of pregnancy.\" \n \nHe said ACC wanted to treat such cases as being confined to the literal state of pregnancy, so that entitlements were limited to those which might arise during the gestation period. \n \nThe product of pregnancy was the birth of a child or children but the Allenby decision did not address the issue of entitlements following birth, such as child care costs, because that was not before the Court. \n \n\"Just as an injured person is entitled to be covered for the physical and mental consequences of accidental injury, so too is the woman whose pregnancy is covered,\" Sara said. \n \n\"ACC is not entitled to cherry pick which entitlements it will provide.\" \n  \n- Stuff \n             \r     Comments", "source": "Timaru Herald"}
