Source: Supplied  \n        \n THOUSANDS of struggling Australians are trapped in a debt vortex with cards maxed out and no way of getting out of the red.  \n   \nThe Consumer Action Law Centre\u2019s financial counselling helpline receives more than 5000 calls a year from people struggling with credit card debt, with 50 per cent facing bills of more than \n\n$10,000. \n\n\u201cEvery week, we hear from someone with credit card debt exceeding $100,000,\u201d said the centre\u2019s policy officer Katherine Temple told the Federal Government\u2019s credit card inquiry, which held its second hearing in Melbourne yesterday. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the vulnerable or uneducated who are at risk of being sucked in, she said; a simple psychological glitch puts us all at risk. \n\nThe \u201coptimism bias\u201d kicks in when we are weighing up our options to make a purchase or financial decision. \n      \n That Gucci bag isn\u2019t going to pay for itself.  Source: Supplied  \n    \nPut simply, it means that we over-estimate our ability to pay for something in the future if we don\u2019t have to worry about it for the time being. \n\nIt makes us less likely to care about a higher interest rate that will kick in 12 months down the track, or to factor in the possibility that an unforeseen disaster could obliterate our ability to pay. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite calculated,\u201d said Ms Temple. \n\n\u201cWe need structural change, to make sure people aren\u2019t being given credit cards that they can\u2019t afford to repay.\u201d \n\nMs Temple said tougher lending rules were needed, to stop banks from heaping massive debt on people who would never be able to pay them off. \n\n\u201cThe optimism bias means that we have a tendency to over-estimate our capacity to pay,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why balance transfers are so attractive \u2014 it\u2019s basically free money (in people\u2019s minds).\u201d \n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission acknowledged this phenomenon in its submission to the inquiry, noting: that \u201cpeople with strong optimism or present biases might begin with the intention of always paying off their balance in full and, based on this intention, may disregard the interest rate on a card in the belief they will not need to pay any interest.\u201d \n     \n If Carrie Bradshaw was real, there\u2019s a fair chance she\u2019d be calling a debt crisis line.  Source: News Corp Australia  \n    \nConsumer advocates say the banks are taking advantage of human nature, profiting from the mental glitch that leaves us vulnerable. \n\nMs Temple said that along with clearer product descriptions, credit card providers should be forced to base their eligibility assessment on whether the customer can pay off the maximum limit in full, to account for consumers\u2019 behavioural biases. \n\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s based on whether you can pay the monthly minimum,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cSo if something happens \u2014 like job loss, or you get sick, or you have a relationship breakdown \u2014 you can find yourself in trouble.\u201d \n\nLike Carl Cavarra, the out-of-work tradie who is facing potential bankruptcy over a $90,000 debt. \n\nThe 34-year-old owes thousands on five different credit cards, on top of a hefty car loan, all approved while he was working fulltime as a bricklayer. \n\nAnd while he was able to afford the minimum payments on these debts while employed, a bad turn of luck left him stuck in a debt spiral. \n\nAfter seven years of physical labour, the bricklayer suffered a triple hernia that required surgery, bed rest \u2014 and left his earning capacity in limbo. \n\nDespite incurring the injury through repeated heavy lifting on the job, Mr Cavarra said, WorkCover deemed his case one of \u201cwear and tear\u201d, so he received no compensation. \n\nOn doctor\u2019s orders, he abandoned his career, moved back in with his parents and started an unsuccessful 10-month search for a new job. \n     \n Melbourne\u2019s Carl Cavarra is facing potential bankruptcy over his $90,000 debt.  Source: NewsComAu  \n    \nUnable to make his $1600 monthly loans repayments while living on a $489 a fortnight Centrelink allowance, Mr Cavarra found himself racking up even more debt by putting his living expenses on his credit cards \u2014 which have interest rates of between 18 and 23 per cent. \n\nIn the end, the cards were maxed out and the creditors came knocking. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked to consolidate my debts so I can make one payment, but the banks refuse,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThey want it paid off in five years, but that\u2019s impossible.\u201d \n\nWithout a job \u2014 despite having applied for hundreds this year \u2014 he was not eligible for a balance transfer. \n\n\u201cI reckon if I don\u2019t find a job by the end of this year, I will have to go bankrupt. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s this situation that the Consumer Action Law Centre argues should be prevented by more stringent lending rules. \n\nWhile it may have been imprudent for Mr Cavarra to saddle himself with so much debt, not giving himself leeway for unforeseen circumstances that could impact his ability to pay, he is far from alone. \n\nAustralians owe a collective $32 billion on their credit cards , with the average card holder paying $700 a year in interest on debts that hover around $4,300. \n\nAnd many of them have no idea how much interest rate they are paying; a survey of 2200 credit card users by ME bank found that 73 per cent did not know their interest rate and 40 per cent did not know if their card had an annual fee. \n\nInquiry chairman and Labor senator Sam Dastyari accused the banks of running a \u201cconfusopoly\u201d, with credit cards marketed in a way that makes it hard for consumers to work out whether they are getting a good deal, amid all the bells and whistles of reward points schemes and promotions. \n\nConsumer group Choice called for credit card advertising to include the monthly cost for a consumer with an average card balance, in dollars, based on the interest rate and annual fee. \n\nThe credit card inquiry will report its finding to the Senate Economics References Committee by November 24. \n\nIf you are struggling to pay your debts, you can speak to an independent financial counsellor free of charge by phoning 1800 007 007. \n\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au \n Originally published as Mental glitch that\u2019s making us spend", "source": "Geelong Advertiser"}
