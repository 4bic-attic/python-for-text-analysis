The latest is Jeb Bush; three years ago, it was candidate Romney. The fact that torture is framed by these candidates as a policy choice, and the possibility that one of them might in fact reintroduce it, is one of Obama\u2019s chief legacies. He chose not to prosecute torture as a crime, instead banning it (or some of it, anyway) via executive order. As I\u2019ve said before: Obama has no more power to prohibit torture than Bush had to permit it. Torture is illegal in America. The law, not the president, is what prohibits torture. What would you make of it if the president said, \u201cThat is why I prohibited murder. That is why I prohibited rape. That is why I prohibited embezzlement, and mail fraud, and tax evasion\u2026\u201d In America, the president doesn\u2019t make the law, nor does he rescind it. The president executes the law\u2014which is why Article 2 of the Constitution is called \u201cThe Executive Branch.\u201d Presidents who make and rescind laws at will are more commonly known as kings. Remember: what one president by fiat prohibits, another at his or her pleasure can permit. Anyone who cheers Obama\u2019s torture \u201cban\u201d is missing the insidious, long-term effect of that ban\u2026and could probably use a refresher course on civics, too. Torture: de jure illegal; de facto policy. Remember Hope and Change? No, it hasn\u2019t gone away. It\u2019s just become a punch line.", "source": "Freedom of the Press Foundation"}
