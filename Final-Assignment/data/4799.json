The donation will help provide food, shelter and comfort to those impacted by the growing wildfires and countless other disasters big and small. \n\nTwo of the largest fires in the state, the Valley Fire and the Butte Fire in Northern California , have collectively burned more than 144,000 acres in less than a week; they have destroyed nearly 1,000 structures, including many homes, and displaced more than 20,000 individuals. Thousands of structures are still at risk. \n\n\"Our thoughts are with the thousands of residents, including Lowe's employees, who've been affected by the widespread fires,\" said Joan Higginbotham , Lowe's director of community relations. \"We'll continue to work internally and through great partners like the American Red Cross to be there to help them recover and provide relief.\"\u00a0 \n\nRed Cross volunteers are working around the clock to help, including 250 Red Cross volunteers and staff members. As of Friday, September 18 , the Red Cross has served more than 32,000 meals and snacks and supported nearly 5,500 overnight stays in shelters. Local Lowe's Heroes employee volunteers stand ready in the affected communities to support recovery efforts. \n\n\"Lowe's is a longtime supporter of the American Red Cross, and we are so grateful for its ongoing support of our disaster relief operations,\"\u00a0said Brad Kieserman , vice president, disaster services operations and logistics.\u00a0\"The devastation of this wildfire season \u2013 particularly the latest fast-moving, all-consuming fires in California \u2013 required an immediate response by the Red Cross and will necessitate an ongoing delivery of humanitarian services; we simply couldn't do this work without the generosity of donors like Lowe's.\" \n\nAs a member of the Red Cross' Annual Disaster Giving Program, Lowe's pledges donations on an ongoing basis in advance of disasters to help ensure the Red Cross can take immediate action.
