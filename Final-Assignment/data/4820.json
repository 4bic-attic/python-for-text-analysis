By the end of the year, Gilway predicted, tens of thousands of more policies will move to the private market. \n \nBy the end of 2016, Citizens projects it will be down to 450,000 policies or fewer. That's a big reduction from 2012, when the company had a record 1.5 million property insurance policies and not enough surplus to cover the state if a major hurricane had hit.", "source": "Tampa Bay Times"}
