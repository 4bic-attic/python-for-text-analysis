Though this tradition is of huge sentiment to past pupils of both schools, who pride themselves on winning, the sport of rugby has always been the winner in these clashes. \n \nAfter the 174th game at first team level, we are mindful of the history of sporting and rugby contacts between Dale and Queen\u2019s and reaching this milestone, is as important today as that first-ever game in 1891 in Queenstown. \n \nAfter this first game in 1891 (won 19-3 by Dale) the next game was played only in 1926 at home in King William\u2019s Town. \n \nDale lost this game 6-0. \n \nThe only time where the rugby tradition was brought to a temporary halt, as we are told, was when football was established at Queen\u2019s as the main winter sport, alongside cricket for summer. \n \nHowever, at Dale, rugby continued unofficially against the rules of the headmaster \u2013 Rev J G Sutton. Association football replaced rugby as the official sport at Dale in 1892. \n \nDuring 1906 a group of Std 4 boys held a meeting in their classroom after school on a Saturday morning. The purpose of the meeting was to endeavour to start rugby to keep the boys busy on Saturday mornings, when there was nothing to do. Humble beginnings for what has become a present-day derby day rugby fixture!", "source": "ShowMe East London"}
