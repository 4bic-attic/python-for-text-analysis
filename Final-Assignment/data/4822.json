Josh Matlow told 680 NEWS. \n \nThe city will be changing 4,450 signs and adjusting the timing on 310 traffic signals, at a cost of $1.1 million. \n \nThe speed limit change affects 387.1 kilometres of local roads. \n \nThe motion was approved by City Hall in June but the debate started last year, after seven-year-old Georgia Walsh was struck and killed by a van in Leaside. \n \nIn 2012,\u00a0the Toronto Board of Health issued a report calling for speed limits to be reduced to 30 km/h on residential streets and 40 km/h on major roads in the interest of public safety. \n \nThe report cited research claiming the chance of a cyclist or pedestrian dying in a traffic accident is drastically reduced if the car is moving more slowly. At 50 km/h there is an 85 per cent chance the victim will die. At 30 km/h the chance is cut to five per cent. \n \nClick here to read the full report. \n \n\u00a0", "source": "CityNews.ca"}
