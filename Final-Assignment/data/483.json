The product is a combination of two active ingredients: Azoxistrobina and Difenoconazol. The promise is to bring \"high performance for the crop management during flowering and a yield increase\". \n \n\"Syngenta strengthens even more its portfolio for the coffee crop. Priori Top improves the fruit set and allows the producer to reap more grain healthy and free of disease, helping to increase the yield, which is one of the pillars of the Good Growth Plan and our Plan of Sustainable Agriculture,\" affirms Philipp Schudt, portfolio manager at Syngenta. \n \nThe consultant of Agrocafe distributor, Rogner Avelar, testifies that this is an \"indispensable tool to control flowering due to the combined action of the two active ingredients that are in the composition, Priori Top acts on the immediate protection as well as on the long-term, becoming an important ally to the coffee grower for a better fruit set\". \n \nPriori Top already has a recognized efficacy controlling diseases on other crops controlling Mycosphaerella areola and Colletotrichum gossypii on cotton. For the citrus segment, the benefits of the use of the product are related to control PFD on citrus that could bring yields up to 50% higher. \n \nSince the beginning of September, Syngenta has held events in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo to introduce the Priori Top technology to farmers. Gathering approximately 280,000 farmers and adding 2.2 million hectares on average in Brazil, the crop has big representation of small coffee growers (70% of the market).", "source": "AgroPages.com"}
