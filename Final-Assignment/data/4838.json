Thousands traveled to the Marshfield Fairgrounds on Sunday to see more than 700 old, restored, and custom cars and trucks. \u201cThere\u2019s something for everyone,\u201d Spindles Auto Club member, Chris Perrotta said. Thunderbirds, Mustangs, Camaros, and recently \u201ctricked-out\u201d cars lined up to be viewed and judged. Peter Anderson was just there to look, but is considering purchasing an older car. \u201cI really like the look of that SS Chevelle,\u201d Anderson said pointing to a shiny orange 1970\u2019s Chevrolet. Many were there to admire the vintage vehicles, purchase cars for sale or parts at the swap-meet, but some were there for another reason entirely. Marshfield artist Ted Polomis attended the car show to get inspiration for his new paintings. Every angle of a metallic Tiffany-blue Corvette was photographed for Polomis\u2019 newest endeavor. Last year\u2019s show attracted more than 6,000 spectators, Spindles Auto Club member, Chris Perrotta said. \u201cUsually people get into this because of their families,\u201d Perrotta said about restoring cars. Nostalgia is the reason he got involved restoring old Ford station-wagons, which is what his father drove. The majority of the proceeds from the show\u2019s entry fee and prize giveaways will go towards Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\u2019s Jimmy Fund and Weymouth High School scholarship fund. Trophies were presented to the best-in-show vehicles and D.A.R.E. officers presented a trophy to the car voted \u201cmost likely to get pulled over.\u201d", "source": "Wicked Local Marshfield"}
