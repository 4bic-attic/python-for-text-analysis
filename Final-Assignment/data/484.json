There are about 10 pages and I'm not going to photo all of them. people can see from those two pages there I took photo of that they are exact section of what is here in their entirety - http://www.theyfly.com/henoch-prophecies\u00a0 There is the proof for that too regarding my other Meier thread - \"1987 Billy Meier prophesied events we now starting to see in France\" http://forums.silverstackers.com/topic- \u2026 rance.html\nAnd now we are seeing all these BS refugees flooding into the EU where no doubt MANY would be IS members. As I said in another (non Meier) thread, this is a dream come true for IS this happening, and there is NO way to tell them apart from the other refugees entering. Sleepers waiting for their orders is what they are.\nThose Meier prophecies regarding IS are going to be as good as fulfilled now, precisely as Meier prophecized there in my other Meier thread.\nNo one here can say Meier is also making that up about IS (fanatics of Islam) as he goes along.\nHe published all that in 1987, and there is the undisputable proof from 2004. Copyright is copyright. There is no way around it. Last edited by Skyrocket (Today 00:38:49)", "source": "Silver Stackers"}
