And it was brilliant to get four, against good tough opposition too. \n \n\u201cIn the first half of the season I felt my performance levels were good but I wasn\u2019t scoring as many goals as I\u2019d have liked. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been different in the second half of the season. The arrival of (New Zealand striker) Rosie White has really helped me and my game has come on as we\u2019ve clicked. I think I\u2019ve got 10 of my goals in the second half of the season.\u201d \n \nWith the league gone, Liverpool Ladies have placed a huge amount of focus on the Continental Cup and Dowie says any of the teams left would have been a difficult match. \n \n\u201cEvery team in the league is strong now. Look at Birmingham beating Chelsea, not many people would have seen that coming. Every team has top quality players. \n \n\u201cBut we really as players want to achieve something and bring silverware back to Liverpool. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re used to winning things every season. This is the furthest we\u2019ve progressed in any of the cups so far and we want to go on and win it.\u201d \n \n Natasha Dowie of Liverpool Ladies celebrates after scoring during the Women's Super League match between Liverpool Ladies and Sunderland AFC Ladies at Select Security Stadium on August 26, 2015 in Widnes, England.

We\u2019re not feeling sorry for ourselves.\u201d \n \nChelsea\u2019s visit to the Select Security Stadium on Sunday will be live on TV and Dowie is fully aware they will face a stern test from the Champions elect. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re a top team and have had a great season. But we want to finish as high up the table as we can. We\u2019ll have a game plan and we\u2019re in confident mood. We\u2019ll have to be at out best and but we\u2019re winners.\u201d \n \nThe big news of the week for Liverpool Ladies has been the announcement of the departure of manager Matt Beard at the end of the season. \n \nHe has led them to two league titles and Dowie paid tribute on her Twitter page. \n \n\u201cPlayed under Matt Beard when I was 18 at Charlton and now at LFC Ladies. He always believed in me and we have made memories for life. Good luck.\u201d \n \nThe Liverpool striker is also hoping that her superb form can once again take the eye of England coach Mark Sampson after she narrowly missed out on the World Cup squad which finished third in Canada. \n \nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s England, I\u2019ve had a taste of it and it\u2019s a great honour. The most important thing is just to enjoy my football, keep scoring goals and play with a smile on my face. If I\u2019m scoring goals he can\u2019t ignore me. I\u2019ll keep positive.\u201d \n LFC Ladies v Chelsea: 7pm on Sunday at Halton Select Security stadium in Widnes. Tickets \u00a35, \u00a32.50 concessions. Anyone at Anfield for Liverpool v Aston Villa can enjoy free admission with their ticket stub or season ticket.", "source": "Liverpool Echo"}
