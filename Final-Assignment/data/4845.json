I had hoped I would never see this type of crisis again.\u201d \n \nAmongst those from the community who pitched in were a group of artistic children from a home-school group in Stroud. \n \nOn Monday they spent the day decorating a painted banner with their colourful footprints, highlighting the plight of refugees who had travelled thousands of miles to reach safety in Europe. \n \nAmong the creators of the banner were seven-year-olds Kaesha Sellors and her brother Flynn and Serena Moffet, three. \n \nNearly 2,000 people have joined Facebook groups which organise donations in Stroud since they were launched, with many saying they would offer a spare bedroom to refugees. \n \nItems collected will be taken to refugees in Calais in October, with a group currently fundraising to pay for the cost of the trip. \n \nEmma Bergsaurd said: \u201cThe amount of people getting involved in Stroud the last few days has been amazing. It was one of those things that just needed one person to get the ball rolling.\u201d \n   \n Share article  \n   \nSarah Lunnon, who was there yesterday, added: \u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen has been inspiring \u2013 it shows what a great community we live in.\u201d \n \nFor more information on the collections, visit the", "source": "Milford Mercury"}
