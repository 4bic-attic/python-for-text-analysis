Paying tribute to the themes of \u201clove\u201d, \u201cpink\u201d, and \u201cwomen\u201d, the exhibition this year will showcase a spectacular range of artworks that celebrate womanhood and the alluring colour. \n\nAn online auction will also be held throughout October. Taking center stage in this project will be a pink-themed auction evening on the evening of October 29 at The Space. Funds raised from the auction will be donated to the Hong Kong Breast Cancer Foundation. \n\nGourmets will also be delighted by the Think Pink afternoon tea set created by Executive Pastry Chef Yves Matthey, which is available throughout the same period as the art exhibition. \n\nClipper Lounge, Mandarin Oriental, 5 Connaught Road Central, Central; +852 2825 4007\n\nTags: Mandarin Oriental, Afternoon Tea, Clipper Lounge, Think Pink, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, The Antithesis Have a moment?
