I love these sorts of things, and now as my girls are 12 and nine-years-old and I am turning 50 next year, I thought now is the perfect time to get back into it.\" \n \nDefined as the furthest point from land on the Arctic Ocean, the Northern Pole of Inaccessibility remains the last significant place in the Polar Regions to be reached by man. \n \nIt sits over two hundred miles further north than the Geographic North Pole and 800 miles from the northern shores of Canada. \n \n Moira Bowen with her two daughters \n \nMoira, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist for Access Sefton , said \u201cI am incredibly excited at this chance to be part of something so momentous and adventurous. \n \n\"Even before we leave for the Arctic, it\u2019s going to be a real challenge to get myself fit enough and prepare for the rigours of being in the intense cold. \n \n\"At home I keep fit by running around after my kids, but the quest for the Last Pole takes the concept of challenge to a whole new level.\" \n \nIn preparation Moira is undergoing a comprehensive and intensive training programme. \n Moira has launched a website for friends, family and those interested to track her progress and donate to two worthy causes.
