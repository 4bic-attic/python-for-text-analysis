Thus is a case of double standards by the south Korean puppet regime.\nSecondly, the south Korean puppets are trying to elevate the so -called \" \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai \" as some kind of force for the salvation of Korea and a \"\"base for struggle for independence\", whereas in reality the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai \" was a few bourgeois nationalists divorced and isolated from the masses. In actual fact, as the DPRK History Society\u00a0 correctly points out, the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai was heavily dependent on the reactionary Kuomintang (Chinese nationalist party ) . As the statement says \" It is a well-known fact that since its establishment in Shanghai, China in April 1919 till its disbandment in August 1945 the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\" barely kept its existence under the care of the Chiang Kai-shek-led Nationalist Party\". It is pure nonsense for the south Korean puppets to try and promote the provisional government as some kind of liberation force. This is a grave distortion of history .\nWe condemn the south Korean puppets for the distortion of history as well as fraudulent hypocrisy .\nASSPUK\nJISGE\nUK KFA", "source": "Anglo-Peoples Korea/Songun"}
