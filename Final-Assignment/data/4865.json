That\u2019s because of the space agency\u2019s history of running into unexpected problems in new programs, like Orion. \n Story continues below    \nManagers set 2023 as the new official launch date for the capsule, although they said they haven\u2019t entirely given up yet on 2021. \n\nOrion is meant to expand human exploration in space, principally Mars. The 11-foot capsule will blast off atop a megarocket still under development by NASA, called SLS for Space Launch System. An unmanned test flight of Orion and the new SLS rocket is still on schedule for 2018. \n\nThe spacecraft sailed through its first test flight in December. Nonetheless, managers said they want to be conservative in what lies ahead. \n        \nOrion lifts off from Cape Canaveral on Dec. 5, 2014, for its first test flight. \n Joe Raedle/    \nNASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot said there were too many variables ahead to calculate the chance of meeting a 2021 launch. But he noted during a teleconference with reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very high confidence level, I\u2019ll tell you that, just because of the things we\u2019ve seen historically pop up.\u201d \n\nSoftware development typically can cause delays, as can the reuse of test hardware. While there are no setbacks in these areas yet, Lightfoot said, \u201cbut we have to account for those because we\u2019ve got a lot of runway in front of us here before we get there, and those things could pop up.\u201d He called these \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d \n\nNASA is committing to a $6.77 billion development cost between this October and Orion\u2019s first crewed flight, no later than 2023. That first flight with astronauts will be to check out Orion\u2019s crew systems close to Earth, especially the life-support equipment. The capsule is designed to hold four astronauts. \n\nOn the second crewed mission, NASA will push deeper into space, perhaps the far side of the moon, said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for human exploration and operations. \n\nThe ultimate prize is Mars \u2014 and, eventually, beyond. \n\nNASA is focusing on Orion and SLS, while letting commercial space companies handle routine supply runs to the International Space Station. The goal is to get private companies \u2014 specifically SpaceX and Boeing \u2014 to start delivering American astronauts as well in 2017. Until then, Russia is doing all the crew transport. \n\nOrion is NASA\u2019s first new spacecraft for humans in more than a generation, succeeding the now-retired space shuttles.", "source": "Global News Canada"}
