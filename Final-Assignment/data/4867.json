At last count, the number was 88,269. \n \nMonday night he saw a message from Thomas, although he almost missed it among the avalanche of friend requests he was also getting. \n \n\"I think I had over 400 friend requests from people all over the world that I don't even know,\" Wingert explained.\u00a0 \n \nAs he scrolled through the requests, he saw \"Thomas\" and clicked on it, and it was the fellow he\u00a0was\u00a0looking for. \n \nIt turns out Thomas Besenski lives in Calgary. He's going to pick up his ukulele on an upcoming trip east, when he passes through Rosetown. \n \nWingert said he's not surprised he was able to find Besenski through Facebook, but \"was surprised at how quickly it (the photo) got shared and how many shares it got.\" \n \nIf he didn't have Facebook, Wingert said he would have tried an online classified ad site such as Craig's List or Kjiji.\u00a0But he's not sure the results would have been the same.", "source": "CBC"}
