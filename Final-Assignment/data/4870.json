\n\nNonetheless, politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have voiced growing concern about the record numbers, and warned the influx would spell both logistical and political problems. \n\nIn Austria, Faymann said that Vienna's assistance was a temporary manifestation of Vienna's \"goodwill\" in the face of a humanitarian emergency. \n\n\"There is no alternative to a common European solution,\" said Faymann, calling for a summit of EU leaders \"immediately after\" an interior ministers' meeting on September 14, the APA news agency reported. \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday spoke by phone with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has called the refugee wave a \"German problem\" caused by Berlin's public statement saying it would welcome Syrians. \n\n\"Both sides agreed that both Hungary and Germany must meet their European obligations, including their obligations under the Dublin agreement,\" said Merkel's spokesman Georg Streiter. \n\nUnder the EU's so-called Dublin rules, asylum applications must be processed by the country where a person first arrives. \n\nOrban and Merkel had agreed that the weekend influx was exceptional, due to the emergency situation in Budapest, Streiter said. \n\nMerkel also faces political pressure at home, where her Bavarian sister party CSU criticised the eased travel rules as \"a wrong decision\", according to its party secretary Andreas Scheuer. \n\nMembers had warned that this had created \"an additional pull-factor\" - aside from push factors such as war, poverty and repression in their home countries. \n\nMerkel was set to hold a crisis meeting on the refugee issue later Sunday with her coalition partners. \n\n- Europe divided - \n\nEurope is deeply divided over how to handle the continent's biggest refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and Hungary's and other eastern European nations' hard line has contrasted with a show of solidarity elsewhere in Europe. \n\nFinnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila has evern offered to put up refugee families in his country home. \n\nUnder intensifying pressure at home and abroad, British Prime Minister David Cameron is set to admit 15,000 refugees from Syria, the Sunday Times reported. \n\nPope Francis called for \"every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary in Europe take in a family.\" \n\nThe UN refugee agency UNHCR on Saturday said 366,402 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with 2,800 dying or going missing en route. \n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed relocating 120,000 refugees from overstretched Italy, Greece and Hungary, a European source has told AFP. \n\nThe plan -- which comes on top of a Commission proposal in May for the relocation of 40,000 migrants -- is expected to be formally unveiled by Juncker on Wednesday after being approved by Commissioners, the source said. \n\nGermany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that under Juncker's plan, Germany would take in about 31,000 people, followed by France with 24,000 and Spain with almost 15,000. \n\nburs-fz/yad \n \n\n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "Expatica Germany"}
