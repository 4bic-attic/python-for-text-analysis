Over a million Canadians donned the uniform, each one making some form of sacrifice during that terrible conflict. Forty-five thousand lost their lives, fifty-four thousand were wounded, not counting those who came home but were never fully able to put the ordeal behind them. They did not set out in search of glory or adventure; they simply stood firm in their resolve to carry out the task before them: to defeat a tyrannical regime. \n\nLet us reaffirm our commitment to preserving the values for which they fought, and let us pay tribute to the determination of our brave soldiers, who gave so much of themselves to bring to a close this dark chapter in our history, 70 years ago. \n\nDavid Johnston \n\nThe 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War is celebrated on September 2, 2015.\n\n\u00a92015 PR Newswire.
