She lived a wonderfully full life and was adored by her family, friends and the millions of readers who she has been entertaining for over four decades. She was a true inspiration, a trail blazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words. \n \nTributes have been streaming in from all over as the world mourns the author who had 31 consecutive New York Times bestsellers: \n \nIn her novels, Collins shared an insider\u2019s view to lives of celebrities, writing about the glitz and glam of Hollywood\u2019s elite. Whether or not you have read anything by her, you are sure to know at least one woman who has. In a frank interview with Marie Claire Collins explained why so many women relate to her books: \u201cThey know that I\u2019m writing the real truth. I do live in Hollywood. I\u2019m disguising the people\u2019s identities, but [readers] love to play the guessing game. They also love the strong women that I write about. And I write incredibly sexy, strong men, too; usually a bad boy who\u2019s waiting to be reformed by the right woman.\u201d \n \nRead the article, in which Collins also addressed Fifty Shades of Grey : \n \nJackie F: You\u2019ve been asked many times about Fifty Shades of Grey and your response is always, \u201cMy women kick arse; they don\u2019t get their arses kicked.\u201d But do you think women sometimes want a man to take control? \n \nJackie C: There\u2019s a taking control and taking control. A lot of men like women to take control in the bedroom sometimes. To have a virgin submissive heroine is not my kind of heroine. It\u2019s great [EL James] has got people reading, but hate the phrase \u201cmummy porn\u201d. It\u2019s kind of disgusting, ridiculous. And what kind of woman want to depend on handcuffs and spanking to get her rocks off? \n  \nThe Santangelos is the latest novel by Collins: \n \nA vicious hit. A vengeful enemy. A drug addled Colombian club owner. A sex crazed Italian family. And the ever powerful Lucky Santangelo has to deal with them all, while Max\u2014her teenage daughter is becoming The \u201cIt\u201d girl in Europe\u2019s modeling world. And her Kennedyesque son, Bobby, is being set up for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. But Lucky can deal. Always strong and unpredictable with her husband, Lennie, by her side she lives up to the family motto\u2014Never fuck with a Santangelo. \n \nLucky rules. The Santangelos always come out on top. An epic family saga filled with love, lust, revenge and passion. \n \nRead the first chapter of The Santangelos , made available for download on the author\u2019s website: \n \nBook details \n  Cats:  Book Excerpts , Fiction , International , South Africa \nTags:  Bonkbuster , Book Excerpts , Books LIVE , Confessions of a Wild Child , Deadly Embrace , English , Excerpts , Fiction , Fifty Shades of Grey , Goddess Of Vengeance , Hollywood Divorces , International , Jackie Collins , Marie Claire , Poor Little Bitch Girl , RIP , RIP Jackie Collins , Romance Novels , Simon and Schuster , Sinners , South Africa , Sunday Reads , The Guardian , The Santangelos \nQuick URL     Did you like this article?", "source": "Books Live"}
