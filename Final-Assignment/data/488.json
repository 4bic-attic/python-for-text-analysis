Come inside and find out where you can see the Queen of Hip Hop Soul Mary J. Blige hitting the stage with talk show hostess Tamar Braxton. \n \n \nThe Queen of Hip Hop Soul Mary J. Blige recently announced a 12-date U.S. tour and we\u2019ve very excited to bring you the dates and the big news about who\u2019s joining her. \n \nMary is going from city to city with a new live show she\u2019s dubbed \u201cMJB Live!\u201d which will start in Augusta, Ga. on October 30th and will breeze through Memphis, Florida, New Jersey and Georgia. \n \nHmmm\u2026\u2026if you have a Food Network fetish, you\u2019ll notice that Mary is going to be passing through some \u201cgood eating\u201d towns.  Good luck to her and her strict diet. We don\u2019t think she\u2019s had a carb since \u201cNo More Drama.\u201d \n \nSo who\u2019ll join MJB?  Drum roll please\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n \n \nIt\u2019s Slay-Tay!  With a new season of \u201cTamar & Vince\u201d coming,   in addition to her day job on \u201cThe Real\u201d and her currently stint on \u201cDWTS\u201d (by the way\u2026she slayed her Quick Step), Tamar Braxton is ALL over the place. \n \nBecause Tay Tay (shown above in a new pic with her newly DISengaged co-host Adrienne Bailon) is dropping her new album Calling All Lovers on October 2nd, the tour will be great support for her latest project.  But be forewarned\u2026\u2026Tamar won\u2019t be at every date. \n \nCheck the dates below: \n \n \nAre you here for this?! \n \n \nPhotos via Tamar\u2019s Instagram/Mary\u2019s Instagram \n \n \u2026read more", "source": "GumBumper"}
