I found the five different \u201cstages\u201d of the Koran\u2019s history to be very interesting, especially Stage 2 (Abu Bakr). Before taking this class, I would have never thought that the writing down of the Koran was at one time up to debate; I would have thought that people would want their religious texts preserved in writing, without question. However, after discussing why Abu Bakr questioned whether or not the Koran should be written down \u2013 how could he do something even Prophet Muhammad hadn\u2019t even done? \u2013 I feel as though I have a much better understanding of Islam and its prophet\u2019s role within the religion. It has become very clear to me that Muhammad was/is greatly revered by followers of Islam; while this was something was was aware of before taking this class, I never realized to what extent. As a non-religious person, I find this type of devotion to be unfamiliar yet fascinating.\n\nI agree with @freebird27's\u00a0opinion on the movie A Separation. I think\u00a0the film provided a great look at the culture of Iran and its people. I was especially interested in the movie\u2019s take on women\u2019s roles in the family and the differences between social classes. A Separation certainly seemed to assert the idea that women in the upper class, such as Simin and even Termeh, are given more respect than those in the lower class, such as Razieh. For example, Simin\u2019s husband remains relatively calm towards her throughout the movie (most of it, anyway) despite their impending divorce. In contrast, Razieh\u2019s husband is quick to anger and accuse her of wrongdoing. Simin, as part of the upper class, also has more autonomy; I highly doubt Razieh\u2019s husband would have let her leave the house as Simin did (and not only because he has major anger issues). Overall, the contrasts made between the classes in A Separation provided interesting social commentary and added to the depth of the film and its meaning(s).", "source": "Islam students at LUC"}
