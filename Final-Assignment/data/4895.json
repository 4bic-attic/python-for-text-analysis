Over that period, unemployment has risen steadily to record levels, despite a stream of initiatives from state-sponsored jobs to sweeping tax cuts for employers to encourage hiring. \n\nMs. Khomri will shoulder a huge responsibility for Mr. Hollande as the Socialist president has said he won't run for re-election in 2017 unless unemployment begins to fall. The latest figures from Eurostat show unemployment in France rose edged up to 10.4% in July from 10.3%, despite declining in the eurozone as a whole. \n\nAs well as the overall challenge of bringing down unemployment, Ms. El Khomri will be charged with examining possible changes to France's complex labor code and initiating negotiations with labor unions over costly welfare benefits. \n\nBefore joining the government, Ms. Khomri held several posts at the Paris town council, specializing in security, crime prevention and child protection. \n\nWrite to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com \n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 02, 2015 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "source": "Swissquote"}
