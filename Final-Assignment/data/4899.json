For example on Instagram, videos are limited to 15 seconds long. Now if you are planning on recording videos on your GoPro and and don\u2019t want the hassle of trimming your videos for Vine or Instagram on your computer, you\u2019re in luck. \n\nGoPro has recently announced a new feature for their cameras and their apps that will allow users to trim their videos on the fly at the touch of a button. This is done via the \u201cTrim\u201d button which can be found in the camera and on the GoPro app that will allow users to trim videos down to 1 second, 15 seconds, or 30 seconds. \n\nAccording to GoPro, the feature will only be available on the HERO4 Black with LCD BacPac, HERO4 Silver, and HERO+ LCD cameras, so if you have a much older GoPro you might be out of luck. Granted your actual footage will be much longer, but if you just want to share a small section on Instagram with perhaps a link to the full clip on YouTube, or maybe share a teaser with some friends, then this is a feature to look forward to. \n\nBest of all, the trimmed clips are saved as new files meaning that the original footage is not destroyed in the process. In the meantime if you\u2019d like to check out the feature in action, you can watch GoPro\u2019s video above for the details. \n\nFiled in Photo-Video .
