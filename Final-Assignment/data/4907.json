Whereas real-life exists in 360 degrees in all directions, filmmakers must make very conscious decisions about what to put inside that box, what to exclude from it, and how to present it all to the audience. \n \nFor the most part, movies stick to\u00a0a few\u00a0standard widescreen aspect ratios, or, if the filmmaker is feeling a bit daring,\u00a0the less common 4:3 aspect ratio. (For example, Fish Tank \u00a0and\u00a0 Ida .) But one video essay argues there\u2019s been a rise in experimentation with non-traditional aspect ratios, including films that change proportions mid-scene (i.e., Tom at the Farm or\u00a0 Life of Pi )\u00a0or reject the idea of a rectangular frame altogether (Gust Van den Berghe\u2019s\u00a0 Lucifer ). Watch and learn after the jump.\u00a0 \n \nDe Filmkrant posted the non-traditional aspect ratios video essay on Vimeo . \n \n\n \nThe post Video Essay: Experimenting with Non-Traditional Aspect Ratios in Modern Cinema appeared first on /Film .", "source": "/Film"}
