This is because it only requires one moving part - the rotating disc - on which the magnetocaloric material is mounted. Decreased operating cost, higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, lesser maintenance cost, and zero emission of hazardous gases are some of the driving factors that are expected to fuel the adoption of the magnetic refrigeration technology in various applications in the coming years. \n\nThis report also covers the drivers, restraints, and opportunities for the studied market.The growth of the market is expected to be primarily driven by factors such as government regulations to ban HFC refrigerants, low maintenance cost of magnetic refrigeration, high energy efficiency, and green technology. Increasing focus on green technology, low maintenance cost, and high energy efficiency are some of the drivers of the market. \n\nCurrently, only a few companies are involved in the manufacturing of magnetic refrigeration technology; however, many players are expected to enter this market in the coming years as it is expected to register a high demand due to its various advantages over conventional refrigeration systems. \n\n\nThe key players in the magnetic refrigeration market include Cooltech Applications ( France ), Camfridge Ltd (U.K.), Astronautics Corporation of America (U.S), Whirlpool Corporation (U.S.), General Electric CO. (U.S.), Qingdao Haier Co., Ltd ( China ), BASF SE ( Germany ), Eramet SA ( France ), Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (U.S.), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd ( South Korea ), and Toshiba Corporation ( Japan ). \n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rsxxp5/magnetic  \n\nMedia Contact:  \n\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n\n\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnetic-refrigeration-market---domestic-commercial-transportation--industrial-analysis---global-forecast-to-2022-300145519.html \n\nSOURCE  Research and Markets", "source": "Market Pulse Navigator"}
