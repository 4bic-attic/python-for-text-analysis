The court filing comes in the office\u2019s formal answer to the civil lawsuit that Courtney Canfield filed last month in U.S. District Court in Topeka. Canfield alleges she was terminated from her clerk\u2019s job after declining to attend prayer services held in the office. In its response, the state told the court that all were welcome to attend the Bible study, but no staff member was required to attend. It noted that the majority of the staff did not attend the sessions. Canfield also contends in her lawsuit that invitations to the religious services at the office were distributed during normal business hours, and that they included a \u201cprayer guide\u201d to be used at that week\u2019s meeting. Kansas responded that it had \u201cinsufficient information\u201d to determine whether the invitation was distributed during business hours, but said those who chose to attend were provided a devotional booklet to be used during the Bible study. Canfield, who was hired in January 2013 as an accounts clerk, contends in her lawsuit that before Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker ousted her in November 2013, he \u201crepeatedly and emphatically indicated a basis for her termination as the fact that, \u2018She just doesn\u2019t go to church.\u2019\u201d Rucker denies in the court filing that he had any knowledge of Canfield\u2019s religious habits while she was employed by the secretary of state\u2019s office. The state rejected the claim that Canfield was discriminated against because of her perceived lack of \u201creligious zeal,\u201d telling the court that she was fired due to her poor work performance and her inability to work productively with others. Canfield\u2019s attorney did not respond to email and phone messages Friday, and Canfield did not immediately respond to a phone message left with a relative. Secretary of State Kris Kobach also did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment. But Vickie Stangle, president of the Great Plains Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the hosting of Bible study sessions in the workplace by the Kansas secretary of state\u2019s office \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d She said employees feel peer pressure to participate even if are not required to attend. Stangle said having the sessions creates the perception that government is promoting and endorsing a religion. \u201cI look at these places as places we are conducting public business and they are not supposed to be houses of worship, and yet it seems to be happening more and more under the guise of so-called religious freedom,\u201d she said.
