Or it could have meant that, but also to pry away a few assets from the capital city's biggest club.\n\nAccording to the London Evening Standard, Wenger flew in to Paris yesterday to initiate talks for striker Edinson Cavani and holding midfielder Adrien Rabiot. Apparently, according to this article, Wenger wants to give Francis Coquelin a chance to hold down that spot but recognizes the options behind Le Coq are Mathieu Flamini and a severely broken-down Mikel Arteta. Netting Rabiot would give him an extremely-promising, long-targeted player of theirs, while Cavani would fulfill his desire to only upgrade at striker if a world-class option was available.\n\nHowever, PSG hasn't shown an apparent willingness to sell either player, but offered Zlatan up to Arsenal as an alternative.\n\nAgain, more to come, but this is how we've arrived to where we're at now. Less than an hour remains. Let's see how it all finishes.", "source": "The Short Fuse -  All Posts"}
