Washington State Cougars : Oh Cougs \u2026 what to make of you. You lose at home to an FCS team. Then you go on the road and beat a Big Ten team. Football totally makes sense. Glad you took last week\u2019s advice. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n11. Colorado Buffaloes : The Buffs snapped a nine-game losing streak and did so with one of their best rushing outputs in almost a decade. I think we got a glance of what this team could be. Question is, can it do it consistently against stiffer competition? \n \n12. Oregon State Beavers : They looked great on their opening drive \u2026 and then it all went to Hades. That was a tough encore for a team trying to rebuild its identity under a new coach. Best to learn from mistakes (and some would include the coaches in that conversation ) and move on. The San Jose State game is more than winnable with Stanford and conference play on the horizon. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 13th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026  \n \nOhio State loses two No. 1 votes to Michigan State in latest poll \u2026\u00a0Oregon out of the top ten; UCLA in \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Three Southeastern Conference teams fell out of the Associated Press Top 25 on Sunday, and the Auburn Tigers dropped 12 spots after the league that set a record for most teams in the college football rankings last week had a rough weekend. \n \nArkansas, Tennessee\u00a0and Mississippi State\u00a0all fell out after losses Saturday. The Tigers needed overtime to beat Jacksonville State of the FCS; they slipped from No. 6 to No. 18. \n \nAuburn will get a chance at redemption next week as the Tigers visit No. 13\u00a0LSU. \n \nThe SEC was down to seven ranked teams, still the most of any conference. The Pac-12 was next with five. \n \nOhio State\u00a0remains No. 1, but the Buckeyes are no longer unanimous. No. 4 Michigan State\u00a0receives two first-place votes after beating Oregon\u00a0 31-28 . Alabama\u00a0remains No. 2. TCU\u00a0is 3. \n \n\u2026 The Pac-12 \u2026 Five Pac-12 teams are ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 poll for the second consecutive week, with USC moving up to No. 6, UCLA claiming the No. 10 spot, Oregon falling to 12th, Arizona jumping to 20th and Utah to 21st. \n \nHere\u2019s the AP Top 25 in full: \n  Ohio State (59 first-place votes)  Alabama  TCU  Michigan State (2)  Baylor  USC  Georgia  Notre Dame  Florida State  UCLA  Clemson  Oregon  LSU  Georgia Tech  Ole Miss  Oklahoma  Texas A&M  Auburn  BYU  Arizona  Utah  Missouri  Northwestern  Wisconsin  Oklahoma State   \nOthers receiving votes: Temple 38, West Virginia 37, Mississippi State 32, Tennessee 30, Toledo 29, Kansas State 26, Arizona State 20 , Boise State 16, Houston 16, NC State 14, Florida 12, Minnesota 9, Arkansas 6, California 5 , Iowa 5, Miami (FL) 3, Stanford 3 , Western Kentucky 2, Virginia Tech 2, Duke 1 \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 12th \n \n. .. Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nOregonian: Missed pass in the final minute \u201cchanges course of Oregon\u2019s season\u201d \n \nFrom the Oregonian \u2026 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t the play that lost the game that rolled through Vernon Adams Jr.\u2019s head like a skipping record, spitting phrases like, \u201cI got to be better,\u201d from his mouth on repeat in the postgame. \n \nIt was two plays before he threw an incomplete pass to Bralon Addison on fourth-and-long that sealed up Michigan State\u2019s 31-28 victory Saturday night at Spartan Stadium. \n \nIt was the play that should have won it for the Ducks that will stick with Adams long after the biggest game of his college football career. \n \n\u201cDefinitely that one to Byron when he was wide-open,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t stop thinking about that. He was wide-open and you got to make that throw and the game is different.\u201d \n \nThe fifth-year senior, in his first month with the Ducks, wasn\u2019t underselling it. The Ducks were down by three in the final minutes of the game and charging up field. The defense, the gassed and battered defense, made the stand it needed to make and the Ducks were facing second-and-six with a host of options and a bag of timeouts. \n \n\u2026 Continue reading story here \u2026 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nOregon State starts fast, but then is dominated by Michigan in 35-7 loss \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Michigan (1-1) looked much better as a team than it did in last week\u2019s loss at Utah. \n \nThe Wolverines also got some breaks in the pivotal second quarter against the Beavers (1-1). \n \nSmith gave the Wolverines a running game they lacked in the opener, but like his coach, he wouldn\u2019t take credit. \n \n\u201cWant to give a shout out to my offensive line,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey opened some holes you could drive a bus through.\u201d \n \nDefensively, Michigan put pressure on Oregon State\u2019s quarterbacks and didn\u2019t give up a lot on the ground \u2014 much to the delight of nearly 110,000 fans who filled the Big House with hopes the sagging program\u2019s new leader will make a difference. \n \nHarbaugh was quietly pacing the sideline for much of the first quarter and early in the second, rarely saying anything to players, coaches or officials. \n \nThat changed when he saw a penalty he didn\u2019t like. The game changed, too. \n \nMichigan\u2019s Jeremy Clark was called for roughing the kicker, setting off Harbaugh. \n \nThe former San Francisco 49ers coach shouted at officials, flailed his arms and threw laminated sheets behind him because he thought Nick Porebski lost his protection as a punter after bobbling the ball and zig-zagging before kicking the ball. \n \nA little later, Oregon State coach Gary Andersen made a curious decision by choosing to punt instead of going for it on a fourth-and-3 from the Michigan 39 while trailing 10-7. \n \n\u201cNever thought to not punt quite frankly,\u201d Andersen said. \n \nThen, the long snap from midfield sailed over Porebski\u2019s head and bounced back to the Beavers 3. \n \n\u201cThat happens once in a half-century,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat was a heck of a good break for us, but we\u2019ll take it.\u201d \n \nSmith scored his second TD with 12 seconds left in the first half to put Michigan up 17-7 and the Beavers never got back in the game. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWashington State bounces back with a 37-34 win over Rutgers with touchdown in final minute \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 \u00a0 Luke Falk led a 10-play, 90-yard touchdown drive, finding River Cracraft with an eight-yard strike with :13 left to lift Washington State past Rutgers, 37-34 Saturday. \n \nFalk threw for 468 yards and four touchdowns. \n \nWhile Janarion Grant tried to be the hero for Rutgers, returning two kicks for touchdowns, he couldn\u2019t return the final kickoff for a touchdown. The ball was kicked to Leonte Carroo and Rutgers tried to do their Stanford vs. California impression, before the ball was thrown forward after several laterals. \n \nGrant had the best game of his collegiate career, returning a kickoff and a punt for late touchdowns. With Rutgers trailing 30-27 with 1:45 left, Grant returned a punt 55-yards for a touchdown to give Rutgers the 34-30 lead. The playmaker returned a kickoff 100 yards to give Rutgers its first lead of the game, 27-23 and finished a school record 339 total yards. \n \nWashington State answered Grant\u2019s 100-yard return with an eight play, 82-yard drive in 2:59. Falk hit Gabe Marks, who made a dazzling 23-yard touchdown catch. \n \nOn its next two drives Rutgers negated two touchdowns with penalties. Rutgers running back Josh Hicks fumbled on the ensuing drive after catching a screen pass and Isaac Dotson recovered for the Cougars. That came one play after a 21-yard touchdown was negated on a holding penalty on Chris Muller. \n \nThe Scarlet Knights defense stopped Washington State on fourth down with 6:10 left, but Justin Goodwin\u2019s offensive pass interference penalty negated a 29-yard touchdown catch by Grant. \n \nThe high-scoring second half came after just one touchdown in the first. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nPac-12 proposes athletes profiting off of their own names (in non-athletic ventures) \n \nFrom CBS Sports \u2026 The Pac-12 has submitted a proposal that would allow college athletes to use their names, images and likenesses to \u201cpromote their own non-athletic business ventures,\u201d the conference said in a news release Friday. \n \nIn light of the pending Ed O\u2019Bannon lawsuit, the Pac-12 idea appears to represent an incremental step by college sports leaders to adopt bylaws allowing players to make money off their name, but with a qualifier. Pac-12 deputy commissioner Jamie Zaninovich said athletes would be able to promote themselves without identifying themselves as an athlete. \n \nUnder current NCAA rules, athletes are prohibited from accepting any money for or permitting the use of their name or picture to advertise or promote directly the sale of a commercial product or service. The eligibility of athletes is not affected if they participated in the promotional activity prior to enrollment and meet certain conditions. \n \nThe Pac-12 submitted the NILs idea to the NCAA last week as part of the Power Five\u2019s proposals for consideration at the NCAA convention in January. The conferences have until Nov. 15 to amend or finalize their concepts for proposals. NCAA autonomy allows the 65 schools from the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC, plus Notre Dame, to create their own legislation that the rest of Division I can elect to follow. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 11th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nExperts split on outcome of Oregon/Michigan State \n \nThere is no lack of attention being paid to the game between No. 7 Oregon and No. 5 Michigan State (6:00 p.m., Saturday, ABC): \n \n\u201cNumbers show importance of rushing game for Oregon, Michigan State\u201d \u2026 From ESPN \n \n\u201cOregon will have to have ducks in a row to beat Michigan State on road\u201d \u2026 From ESPN \n \n\u201cPick Six: Michigan State to get best of Oregon in rematch\u201d \u2026 From CBS Sports \n \n\u201cCollege football picks Week 2: Experts favor Michigan State in Oregon rematch\u201d \u2026 From The Sporting News \n \n\u201cMichigan State looks to improve on poor Week 1 play-action numbers: Oregon Ducks quick hits\u201d \u2026 From the Oregonian \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 10th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nESPN: CU one of five Pac-12 teams which need to \u201cbounce back\u201d in Week Two \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Week 1 was not what many people thought it would be for the Conference of Champions. But Week 1 is just that \u2014 Week 1 \u2014 with plenty of time brush a shaky 7-5 performance under the rug and move on to the next one. \n \nFive teams \u2014 Arizona State, Colorado, Stanford, Washington and Washington State \u2014 are looking to do just that. Here\u2019s what they have coming up. \n \n\u2026 \n \nCOLORADO \n  Next opportunity : vs. UMass  What went wrong in Week 1: There are the turnovers, the two missed red zone opportunities, the special teams breakdowns \u2026 and, of course, the clock management at the end of the game \u2014 which, yes, some of the blame does go to the officials.  What needs to happen in Week 2 : Believe it or not, I still think Colorado is a decent football team \u2014 when the Buffaloes are consistent. Eliminating mistakes is easier said than done. We get that. But when everything is clicking, this team still has potential.  Coach speak, Mike MacIntyre : \u201cThey saw the bone-headed mistakes. Hopefully they understand the mistakes that we made that cost us the football game. It wasn\u2019t anything Hawaii did. It was what we did. If they can understand that and get things done, we\u2019ll keep playing good.\u201d   \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 8th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026  \n \nSEC has ten teams ranked in the top 25 (first time that\u2019s ever happened) \n \nStanford and Arizona State dropped out of the poll this week from the Pac-12, but Utah jumped in. \n \nThe AP poll for Week Two \n     1         -     Ohio State Buckeyes (61) \n Overall: (1-0) \n Statistics | Schedule | Roster \n09/07 defeated Virginia Tech 42-24 \n09/12 Hawaii 3:30 PM EDT    1525     2         (1)     Alabama Crimson Tide \n Overall: (1-0) \n Statistics | Schedule | Roster \n09/05 defeated Wisconsin 35-17 \n09/12 Middle Tennessee 4:00 PM EDT    1420     3         (-1)     TCU Horned Frogs \n Overall: (1-0) \n Statistics | Schedule | Roster \n09/03 defeated Minnesota 23-17 \n09/12 Stephen F.

Colorado Buffaloes: Once again, we were willing to give the Buffs the benefit of the doubt heading into Week 1. Once again, the Buffs disappointed. Say what you want about how that game ended. Colorado should never have been in that spot to begin with. I do think Colorado is better than the product in Hawaii. But the benefit of the doubt is quickly slipping away. \n \n12. Washington State Cougars: Want people to stop saying \u201cThey Coug\u2019ed it\u201d? Then stop Coug\u2019ing it.\\ \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nArizona linebacker Scooby Wright out \u201cthree-to-four weeks\u201d \u2026 (Game against CU October 17th) \n \nFrom CBS Sports \u2026 Arizona star linebacker Scooby Wright III might only miss \u201cthree to four weeks\u201d after undergoing minor knee surgery to repair damage from an injury suffered in the Wildcats\u2019 season opener against UTSA on Thursday. \n \nWright underwent a procedure to repair a lateral meniscus tear in his left knee over the weekend, and on Monday Rich Rodriguez delivered the official timetable for his return. \n \nWright will still travel with the team, according to Rodriguez, while he recovers. If the timetable works out in Arizona\u2019s favor, Wright could be back on the field for Arizona\u2019s Pac-12 opener against UCLA. Given what we saw from the Bruins, Arizona may need its most aggressive defensive performance to disrupt Josh Rosen\u2019s rhythm under center. \n \nStill, the most important news is that this is expected to be a minor injury that will allow Wright to return to the field this season. Wright has only been playing college football for two years and has already assumed the role of one of the sport\u2019s most exciting playmakers. Last season, he ranked in the top five nationally in tackles, sacks and forced fumbles \u2026 and perhaps No. 1 nationally in terrorizing opposing offensive coordinators. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 7th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nCoug Center \u2013 Loss to Portland State \u201cit\u2019s incredibly hard to watch, think about or root for this team\u201d \n \nA good essay from Brian Floyd for Coug Center. It really speaks to fans of teams like Washington State (and Colorado), who continue to believe, and yet are not being rewarded for their continuing devotion. \n \nThe full essay (which I recommend) can be found here . Some excerpts: \n \n\u2026 Which brings us to Saturday\u2019s season opener. The first game of the season is supposed to be fun, a celebration of college football\u2019s return. Everyone is a blank slate, filled with hope stemming from unknowns. We default to the positive side of those unknowns, no matter how bad the previous season was. Saturday\u2019s game against Portland State was supposed to be easing into the schedule, a tuneup before a road test against Rutgers. College football was coming back, and it was an exciting time. \n \nI was excited about Washington State football this year. It seemed possible that last year was a tad bit of regression after going to a bowl game well ahead of schedule the year before. There was talent, on paper, and a better understanding of the system. The defense was new and fresh, and hey maybe a change at the top of the org chart was needed on that side of the ball. \n \n\u2026 There was no reason for the Cougars to get completely gashed on defense. The new look on that side of the ball appears to be \u201cdumpster fire that takes half an hour to get roaring.\u201d The offense still isn\u2019t clicking, and receivers as experienced as Washington State\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be letting so many balls hit the turf (and don\u2019t use weather as an excuse). \n \n\u2026 This, however, is about as low as it gets, for me. Losing to an FCS team on opening weekend in a season we were hoping would be a bounce back is a punch in the gut right off the bat. Maybe it gets better and this was a hiccup. But right now, it\u2019s incredibly hard to watch, think about or root for this team. And it\u2019s nearly impossible to believe Leach has this team on the right track. \n \nWelcome back to college football. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nUCLA loses star defensive lineman to a torn ACL \n \nFrom Fox Sports \u2026 \u00a0Eddie Vanderdoes standout on the UCLA D-line, suffered a torn ACL in the Bruins\u2019 win over Virginia on Saturday, a source told FOX Sports Sunday. Vanderdoes will miss the rest of the 2015 season. \n \nUCLA spokesman Josh Rupprecht confirmed the injury to The Associated Press later Sunday night. \n \nThe 6-foot-4, 305-pound junior had a team-high eight tackles in the Bruins\u2019 34-16 win vs. the Cavaliers. Vanderdoes, who has played in every one of UCLA\u2019s 27 games since arriving on campus, was\u00a0an honorable-mention All-Pac-12 Conference selection last season. \n \nThe Bruins still have All-American candidate Kenny Clark to anchor the D-line, but now 305-pound junior Eli Ankou and 275-pound sophomore Matt Dickerson need to step up in Vanderdoes\u2019 absence. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWashington State,\u00a0Colorado\u00a0and USC in USA Today \u201cMisery Index\u201d  \n \nFrom USA Today \u2026 (Disclaimer: This isn\u2019t a ranking of worst teams, worst losses or coaches whose jobs are in the most jeopardy. This is simply a measurement of a fan base\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to what they last saw. The way in which a team won or lost, expectations vis-\u00e0-vis program trajectory and traditional inferiority complex of fan base all factor into this ranking.) \n \n6. Washington State : Despite his feel-good second season in which he beat Southern California and took the Cougars to a bowl game, Mike Leach\u2019s record at Washington State is 12-26 after Saturday\u2019s loss to FCS member Portland State. \n \nBut here\u2019s the really scary thing for Washington State fans: If he can\u2019t fix it, who can? Bottom line: The Cougars don\u2019t have any real excuse for losing to an FCS team in Leach\u2019s fourth season. \n \nIt\u2019s not their facilities, which are marvelous. It\u2019s not their head coach, who is accomplished. It\u2019s not their schedule, which has been manageable. And given the way Leach talked about his team in the preseason, it shouldn\u2019t be the talent level. But something is missing, and the Misery Index grants Washington State fans free reign to freak out over the state of this program now that 2015 is already on track to be a disappointment. \n \n7. Colorado : The non-conference trip to Hawaii is among the most alluring setups for a major football program. The idea is to go get a relatively easy win, be able to play a 13th game (an obscure NCAA rule) and enjoy a couple days of paradise with your players, fans and administration. \n \nOf course, that requires you actually winning the game, which Colorado was unable to accomplish in a 28-20 loss. Forget the specifics of what happened at the end \u2014 and yes, Colorado fans will forever complain about how quickly the ball was spotted by the officiating crew and the inability to get off one final play that might have given the Buffaloes a chance to tie the game. \n \nBut if you take a step back, Colorado probably should be better than a life-or-death struggle at Hawaii if the program is progressing as quickly as Mike MacIntyre hoped. It\u2019s not, and that\u2019s a problem as the Buffaloes face one of the most difficult Pac-12 schedules in league history, facing Oregon and Stanford in crossover games as well as the loaded South division. Colorado\u2019s bowl-less streak of seven seasons appears likely to become eight. \n \n8. Southern California : Few were as critical of head coach Steve Sarkisian\u2019s drunken appearance at the program\u2019s \u201cSalute to Troy\u201d preseason event as USC fans themselves, which is a refreshing departure from the typical mindless fandom the Misery Index sees on a daily basis. But the truth is USC fans know more than anyone that Sarkisian, whether\u00a0he actually has a drinking problem, most certainly has a propensity to act like a 21-year-old frat boy problem. \n \nAnd that feeds into the narrative that Sarkisian\u2019s teams will chronically underachieve because they lack the focus, discipline and seriousness to make it through a taxing 12-game schedule without a couple of unnecessary hiccups. So while the Trojans did what was expected in waxing Arkansas State\u00a055-6, it\u2019s a victory that does little to calm the nerves about what\u2019s in store this season. And it certainly doesn\u2019t help that USC fans now realize what they\u2019ll have to deal with in UCLA freshman quarterback Josh Rosen for the next three years. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 5th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026  \n \nArizona linebacker Scooby Wright may be back \u2026 in time to play Colorado October 17th \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Arizona Wildcats linebacker Scooby Wright had his left knee scoped to repair a lateral meniscus tear, a source confirmed to ESPN\u2019s Brett McMurphy. \n \nThe Wildcats hope to \u201chave him back in a month,\u201d the source said. \n \nWright injured the knee in the first quarter of Thursday night\u2019s 42-32 win over Texas San Antonio. \n \nHe hobbled off the field midway through the first quarter. Television cameras later caught trainers icing Wright\u2019s knee on the sideline, where he later walked with a limp and a cane. \n \nArizona coach Rich Rodriguez is expected to give an update on Wright on Monday, a school spokesman said. The Wildcats visit Nevada on Sept. 12. \n \nOther games Wright is likely to miss include home dates with Northern Arizona on Sept. 19 and No. 13 UCLA on Sept. 26. \n \n\u2026 Arizona plays at Colorado on October 17th \u2026 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWashington State falls to Portland State, 24-17 \n \nWhile no Pac-12 coach was considered to be on the hot seat heading into the 2015 season, the seat just got a little warmer for Mike Leach at Washington State. In his first three seasons, Leach posted a 12-25 record, failing to generate the success he had at Texas Tech. \n \nMake that 12-26. \n \nPortland State from the Big Sky Conference, which had an 0-14 all-time record against FBS schools, defeated the Cougars, 24-17. Washington State had a 10-0 lead at halftime, but the Vikings scored 17 straight points to take the lead early in the fourth quarter. After the Cougars mounted a drive to tie the game, Portland State put together a 14-play, 69-yard touchdown drive to take a 24-17 lead. With less than a minute to play, the Vikings picked off a tipped ball, giving Washington State its first-ever loss to an FCS team \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nNo. 21 Stanford the first ranked team of the falls to Northwestern \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 \u00a0Northwestern wanted to prove a point against No. 21 Stanford, and the Wildcats drove it home with a strong running game and solid defense that produced a season-opening surprise. \n \nFreshman Clayton Thorson ran for a 42-yard touchdown while playing turnover-free ball at quarterback, Justin Jackson added 134 yards rushing, and the Wildcats beat the Cardinal 16-6 on Saturday afternoon. \n \nAnthony Walker broke up two passes and had a fumble recovery, and Kyle Queiro intercepted Kevin Hogan in the end zone with about a minute left to seal the win. \n \nThorson scored the game\u2019s only touchdown in the second quarter. He also threw for 105 yards, completing 12 of 24 passes. \n \nJackson rushed 28 times. Jack Mitchell kicked three field goals, including a career-long 49-yarder that made it 16-6 with 3:38 left in the game, and the Wildcats started the season on a winning note for the first time against a ranked team since 1995. \n \nIt was just what they needed after back-to-back 5-7 finishes, a run that followed five straight bowl appearances. \n \nStanford, coming off an 8-5 season that snapped a string of four consecutive BCS bowls, clearly has some work to do. \n \nHogan had a rough afternoon, going 20-of-35 with 155 yards and an interception. He was sacked three times. \n \nChristian McCaffrey ran for 66 yards, but the Cardinal managed just 240 yards on offense and scored their fewest points since 2007. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 4th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nChris Petersen falls to former school in Washington\u2019s loss to Boise State \u2026 \u201cI feel physically sick\u201d \n \nFrom the Seattle Times \u2026 So successful at keeping the identity of their starting quarterback a secret all week, the Washington offense was only suspect in the first half of their season opener Friday night. \n \nSo to see that offense suddenly find itself driving in the final minute of a dramatic comeback bid, with a chance to tie No. 23 Boise State, well, it was at least a little encouraging. \n \nRight? No, Jake Browning didn\u2019t want to hear it. \n \n\u201cI feel physically sick right now,\u201d he said moments after the Huskies\u2019 16-13 defeat in Chris Petersen\u2019s return to Boise. \n \n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to answer a question about encouragement when you just lost,\u201d Browning added. \u201cYeah, there encouraging things there, but at the end of the day you lost. \u2026 We only lost by three to a good team, but we want to win. There\u2019s no pity points.\u201d \n \nThe Huskies, down 16-0 at halftime, got back in the game thanks key special-teams performances from Dante Pettis (76-yard punt return for a touchdown), Jaydon Mickens (blocked punt) and Cameron Van Winkle (two made field goals). \n \nWashington\u2019s comeback bid ended, however, when the offense stalled at the 29-yard line and Van Winkle missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt wide right with 21 seconds left. \n \n\u2026 Continue reading story here \u2026 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nReport: Injury to Scooby Wright will not be season-ending \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Arizona linebacker\u00a0Scooby Wright\u2019s left knee injury is not season-ending, sources told ESPN\u2019s Brett McMurphy. \n \nWright, who injured the knee in the first quarter of Thursday night\u2019s 42-32 win over Texas San Antonio, underwent an MRI after the game. Results indicate Wright\u2019s injury will not cause him to miss the rest of the season, sources said. \n \nWright hobbled off the field midway through the first quarter. Television cameras later caught trainers icing Wright\u2019s knee on the sideline, where he later walked with a limp and a cane. \n \nArizona coach Rich Rodriguez is expected to give an update on Wright on Monday, a school spokesman said. The Wildcats visit Nevada on Sept. 12. \n \nWright led the nation in tackles, tackles for loss and forced fumbles last season. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSeptember 3rd \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause  \u2026 \n \nUtah spoils the debut of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Jim Harbaugh was swarmed by cameramen from the moment he stepped off the bus at Rice-Eccles Stadium. College football\u2019s newest rock star had finally arrived to play a game after eight months of hype. \n \nAnd Utah\u00a0was sick of hearing about it. \n \nThe Utes felt disrespected despite being favored and spoiled Harbaugh\u2019s Michigan\u00a0coaching debut with a smothering defense, beating the Wolverines 24-17 on Thursday night in the opener for both teams. \n \n\u201cWe beat Michigan for the third time in a row,\u201d Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \u201cThat\u2019s a heck of an accolade for our program.\u201d \n \nHarbaugh came as advertised \u2014 blue long-sleeved shirt, blue cap with the block \u201cM,\u201d khakis and lanyard with whistle attached. \n \nUnfortunately for Michigan fans, the team didn\u2019t look drastically different from the 2014 version. The quarterback struggled, and the run game was nonexistent. That spelled trouble for the offense. \n \n\u201cI thought we were playing a little bit tentative in the first half and not coming off the ball like we need to,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cWe did miss some holes, backs missed some holes. All things to grow and improve on, and I thought we did that as the game went on.\u201d \n \nHarbaugh, the former Michigan quarterback who returned to his alma mater eight months ago after leaving the NFL\u2019s San Francisco 49ers, faced many of the same issues that plagued former coach Brady Hoke. \n \nQuarterback Jake Rudock beat out Shane Morris for the start. An Iowa transfer, Rudock had a reputation for limiting turnovers but promptly threw three interceptions against Utah and finished 27-for-43 for 279 yards and two touchdowns. Michigan was held to 355 yards, gaining only 76 on the ground. Eighty of those yards came on Michigan\u2019s final drive of the game. \n \n\u2014 \n \nNo. 22 Arizona gets by UTSA in opener, but may have lost star linebacker Scooby Wright \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 Arizona struggled defensively, was uneven on offense and had trouble putting away a smaller-conference team at home. \n \nThat wasn\u2019t even close to the worst news of the night. Losing All-American linebacker Scooby Wright to a knee injury early in the game trumped it all. \n \nAnu Solomon threw four touchdown passes to help No. 22 Arizona beat UTSA 42-32 Thursday night, but the Wildcats suffered a big blow when Wright went out with a left knee injury. \n \nWright, who swept the major defensive player of the year awards last season, went out in the first quarter, tried to return and went back out after one play. He spent the second half in street clothes, walking with a cane, and was scheduled to have an MRI Thursday night. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad \u2014 MCL, ACL, whatever \u2014 but I don\u2019t want to speculate,\u201d Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d \n \nEven before Wright went down, Arizona\u2019s defense struggled. The Wildcats scored two defensive touchdowns, but gave up 525 total yards to UTSA, which returned two offensive starters. \n \nThe offense was good at times, sputtered others, finished with a pedestrian-for-them 392 total yards. Solomon had with 229 yards on 22-of-26 passing, and Nick Wilson added 97 yards rushing. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nUniversity of Washington sells naming rights for Husky Stadium to Alaska Airlines for $41 million \n \nFrom seattlepi.com \u2026 The University of Washington announced a proposal to sell naming rights at\u00a0Husky Stadium to Seattle-based Alaska Airlines. \n \nThe agreement, which is still subject to approval to UW\u2019s Board of Regents, would make the official name of the Huskies\u2019 football home \u201cAlaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.\u201d \n \nThe airline will pay $41 million for the naming rights for the field, as well as the adjoining \u201cUniversity of Washington Athletic Village presented by Alaska Airlines.\u201d They\u00a0will also continue their naming rights for Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, as well as serve as the official airline of all three UW campuses for the next decade. \n \n\u201cI am thrilled that we can expand on a local connection and enhance a long-standing relationship with a Seattle company who shares our values so deeply,\u201d UW Director of Athletics Scott Woodward said in a statement. \u201cAs the costs of funding a first-class student-athlete experience continue to rise, it is critical that we seek new and creative funding opportunities with partners who share our values, and I am pleased because that is exactly what we have done with Alaska Airlines. \n \n\u201cThis exciting new agreement will work directly to fund our student-athlete experience and allow us to stay in front of the rising costs of funding student-athlete recruitment, scholarship, travel and competition.\u201d \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nColorado to face\u00a0ten USA Today preseason All-Americans; Nelson Spruce 2nd-team \n \nThe USA Today has published its preseason All-American teams.

DirecTV will make a deal that should come into play in time for the start or near the start of the 2015 college football season.\u00a0 BruinReport has learned this through their sources . \n \nDirecTV is the last major carrier that the Pac-12 has wanted to get on board, their proverbial white whale so to speak.\u00a0 DISH signed up years ago ,\u00a0 Comcast, Time Warner, Bright House and Cox were the first to get on board, AT&T also recently joined up, and plenty of local cable carriers on the West Coast also have the conference channel. But DirecTV makes the Pac-12 Network a true national network, like with the SEC and Big Ten Network. It should ensure long term visibility and give the conference coast-to-coast viewing ability for any sports fan. Because NFL Sunday Ticket is exclusively carried by DirecTV, it remains the best option for all sports fans across the country. Now the Pac-12 doesn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nAugust 28th \n \n\u2026 Foe Pause \u2026 \n \nFormer Eastern Washington quarterback Vernon Adams named starter at Oregon \n \nFrom the Oregonian \u2026 \u00a0It took Vernon Adams Jr.\u00a0two months to pass one final math class before he could complete his transfer from Eastern Washington and enroll at Oregon. \n \nOnce he got on campus, however, acing the Ducks\u2019 quarterback test took just two weeks. \n \nOregon\u2019s first depth chart of the 2015 college football season, released Friday afternoon, listed Adams\u00a0as the starter and Jeff Lockie\u00a0his\u00a0backup for the Sept. 5 season opener against Eastern Washington \u2014 his former team. \n \nThe race to replace Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Marcus Mariota\u00a0came down to Adams, the dynamic playmaker who accounted for 121 touchdowns in three seasons as Eastern Washington\u2019s starter at the Football Championship Subdivision, and Lockie, the career backup who even Adams acknowledged knows\u00a0the UO playbook better than anyone. \n \nYet Adams appears to have won\u00a0the job decisively. Oregon typically adds an\u00a0\u201cOR\u201d next to a player\u2019s name on a depth chart when a competition\u00a0is close, but\u00a0no such distinction separates Adams and Lockie. \n \nGiven Adams\u2019\u00a0FCS-level accolades \u2014 a two-time runner-up for the Walter Payton Award, along with a stunning victory over top-25-ranked Oregon State in 2013 \u2014 Friday\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t unexpected. But his late arrival to camp cast doubt as to whether he\u2019d fit into Oregon\u2019s offense quickly enough in order to start the first game. \n \nFriday\u2019s announcement answered that loud and clear, even if coaches and players were unavailable for comment. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nDirecTV deal with Pac-12 may finally be a done deal \n \nThere have been no official announcements, but the Twitter universe seems to believe it is actually coming to fruition. \n \n\u2026 Here is an example \u2026 \n \nMore this afternoon when (hopefully not \u201cif\u201d) there is an announcement \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\u2014 \n \nStewart Mandel from Fox Sports projects Colorado to be bowl eligible this fall \n \nWhile Mandel has Colorado playing in the Birmingham Bowl as a fill-in for an SEC team, it\u2019s heady stuff to have a national columnist to actually project the Buffs to be bowl eligible. \n \nOverall, Mandel has nine Pac-12 teams being eligible for bowl bids (including all of the Pac-12 South, and excluding Oregon State, Washington, and Washington State.

The five-star prospect was rated as the top pro-style quarterback in the 2015 recruiting class by 247Sports. \n \nStill, no matter how many stars a kid has coming out of high school, Rosen will still be a true freshman quarterback starting for a Bruins team that enters 2015 with high expectations. UCLA enters the season ranked No. 13 in the AP Poll, and No. 14 in the Coaches Poll, and has won a total of 20 games the last years. \n \nBut that was with Brett Hundley running the show. \n \nIt will be interesting to see if UCLA can live up to the hype while also dealing with the bumps in the road that come with playing a true freshman at the most important position on the field. That being said, it\u2019s clear that Mora believes in Rosen, or else he wouldn\u2019t be giving him the job. \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nESPN:\u00a0Sefo Liufau 8th-best quarterback in the Pac-12 \n \nFrom ESPN \u2026 We\u2019re ranking the Pac-12\u2019s quarterback situations entering the 2015 season. Not all starting battles are set yet, but here\u2019s our first stab at it: \n \n8. Colorado: Buffs coach Mike MacIntyre recently said this: \u201cAfter this year is over, I think people are going to say Sefo Liufau is one of the best junior quarterbacks in America.\u201d That statement will obviously be received with skepticism, but Liufau certainly wasn\u2019t an absolute weakness on a bad 2014 Colorado team. He did throw 15 interceptions, but expect that number to drop if the Buffs\u2019 defense improves and doesn\u2019t force Liufau to play nearly constant desperation football. \n \nTeams ranked below Colorado \u2026 9. Utah (somewhat of a surprise, considering the success Travis Wilson has had over his career); 10. UCLA (drama in the choice between freshman Josh Rosen and Jerry Neuheisel; 11. Oregon State (already announced the Beavers will alternate quarterbacks during non-conference play); and 12. Washington (uncertainty as to when a starter will even be named). \n \n\u2014-", "source": "CU At the Game"}
