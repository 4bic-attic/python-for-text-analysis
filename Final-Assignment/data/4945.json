It does, however, start with 10 airbags, ABS braking, Stabilitrak, tilt/telescoping steering, power windows, remote keyless entry and six-speaker audio.\r \n \n\r\n                            The lineup builds on that foundation as you move up the trim level ladder to 2LS ($18,775), 1LT ($20,040), Eco ($21,740), 2LT ($22,140), 2.0TD ($25,295) and LTZ ($27,195).\r \n \n\r\n                            If we follow that progression of pricing, the 2.0TD diesel seems to take a significant jump in cost but it should be noted that the price includes a standard six-speed automatic, normally a $1,450 - $1,675 option.\r \n \n\r\n                            GM execs figure the diesel engine actually adds about $1,500 but it\u2019s hard to pin down because of the 2.0TD\u2019s apples-and-oranges mix of equipment, blending the upscale, leather appointed amenities of LT and LTZ models with the fuel-efficient technologies of the Eco model including a special Aero Package with grille shutters, rear spoiler and body kit, low resistance rolling tires on special 17-inch alloy wheels and a tire inflator kit instead of compact spare.\r \n \n\r\n                            Unique add-ons for the diesel include a 17-litre diesel exhaust fluid tank, remote vehicle start and specially adapted MDK Hydra-Matic six-speed automatic tranny.\r \n \n\r\n                            Is the diesel worth it? Well, I hate to fudge the answer, but that depends.\r \n \n\r\n                            The strength, simplicity and durability of a diesel always appeals to high-mileage commuters. There\u2019s a bit of the usual clatter on cold startup but, at cruising speeds, the diesel engine is muted, as civilized as it is strong.\r \n \n\r\n                            The 8.7/5.1L/100km (city/hwy) rating may be the lowest of the lineup but a gasoline-powered ECOTEC 1.4-litre turbo offered with the LT, LTZ and Eco models makes the same horsepower, less torque but with fuel econ numbers close to the diesel rating.\r \n \n\r\n                            My real world results after a mixed bag of driving conditions with the 2.0TD diesel worked out to a still excellent 6.8L/100km (comb). Those numbers would translate into an 850 km plus range on a tank of gas.\r \n \n\r\n                            You might also save on less expensive diesel fuel, about a dime cheaper per litre during my test period, but I have seen diesel bounce up and down on either side of the regular gas price over the last few years, so that\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot. There\u2019s also always the caveat of fewer diesel gas pumps and, usually, dirtier diesel gas pumps.\r \n \n\r\n                            And I\u2019ll add one more complication to the decision process - a brand new, larger, lighter, tech-loaded and more fuel-efficient 2016 Cruze that will go on sale early next year, followed a year later by a brand new 2017 diesel version.\r \n \n\r\n                            Ah, yes. Decisions, decisions.\r \n \n\r\n                            There\u2019s no shortage of choices in the Chevrolet\u2019s best-selling Cruze lineup, both now and in the future, but, for 2015, the 2.0TD model offers strong, thrifty performance and civilized upscale amenities blended into a handsome package with all the usual hallmarks of award-winning diesel dependability.\r \n \r\nWHAT\u2019S BEST: The Chevrolet Cruze 2.0TD (diesel) is claimed to be the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid car on the road today. \n\r WHAT\u2019S WORST: The diesel engine should be available at lower price/trim levels.\r \n \n\r WHAT\u2019S INTERESTING: Even after a recent 2015 makeover, a brand new lighter, larger and more technically enhanced 2016 Cruze is set to debut next year with a 2017 Cruze diesel model slated to follow a year later.\r \n CHEVROLET CRUZE 2.0TD 2015 AT A GLANCE  \n\r\n                            \r BODY STYLE: Compact five-passenger sedan\r \n \n\r\n                            \r DRIVE METHOD: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive\r \n \n\r\n                            \r ENGINE: 2.0-litre DOHC turbo diesel (151 hp, 264 lb/ft with 280 lb/ft overboost)\r \n \n\r\n                            \r FUEL ECONOMY: 8.7/5.1L/100km (city/hwy); As tested 6.8L/100km (comb)\r \n \n\r\n                            \r CARGO: 377 litres (13.3 cu ft)\r \n \n\r\n                            \r PRICE: MSRP $25,295.
