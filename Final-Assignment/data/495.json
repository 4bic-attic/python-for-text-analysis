Judge\u00a0Bunning earlier said he was not inclined to release her on Thursday. \n \n \n \nMs Davis, who broke down crying, was led away by US\u00a0Marshals after the first hearing. \n\nThe 49-year-old woman, who has emerged as a darling of social conservatives, has refused to issue licences to any couples, gay or straight, since the US Supreme Court in June ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry under the US Constitution, citing her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian. \n \nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis, right, talks with David Moore following her office's refusal to issue marriage licences at the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Kentucky, on Tuesday.
