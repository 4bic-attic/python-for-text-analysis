The council is expected to address her request later this morning. \n\nThe city is contributing $75,000 toward the $1.35 million public outreach contract ahead of a possible transportation tax\u00a0referendum. \u00a0And even the total cost of the outreach project, paid mostly by county tax dollars, is just a\u00a0tiny percentage of the $4-to-$7 billion that could be raised by a successful transportation referendum in 2016. \n\nBut with a good portion of the outreach\u00a0contract going straight to The Leytham Group, a public relations firm run by Beth Leytham, the controversial political adviser to Mayor Bob Buckhorn and Commissioner Ken Hagan, several officials have suggested putting some distance between Leytham and the process to restore public trust. \n\nWATCH: Raw reactions from politicians who declined interviews \n\nOn Monday, 10 Investigates used public documents to show what appeared to be\u00a0Leytham improperly lobbying on\u00a0the Go Hillsborough issue and other public contracts around Tampa Bay. \n\nAnd on Wednesday, the county commission ordered an independent audit of how the contract was procured, with some officials suggesting a\u00a0\"pause\" or \"reset\" on the process to restore trust in transportation expansion in Hillsborough County. \n\nCity councilwoman Montelione has expressed her frustrations to\u00a0the county's Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in recent months\u00a0about the escalating costs of Go Hillsborough's public outreach, but appeared especially frustrated Thursday morning when she requested council reconsider its resolution from two weeks ago.\u00a0{ READ: Tampa council's\u00a0resolution on\u00a0pg. 347 } \n\nStay tuned for more updates on this story throughout the day. \n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: \n9/16/15 - Hillsborough Commission orders review after 10 Investigates story \n9/15/15 - Hillsborough County fails to police lobbyists \n9/14/15 - How a political consultant is calling the shots; and getting your tax dollars \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1KiY", "source": "10connects.com"}
