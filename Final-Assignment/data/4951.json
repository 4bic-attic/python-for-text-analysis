Abbrederis returned to practice on Tuesday, the same day that the Packers are required to trim their roster from 83 to 75 players. The former fifth-round draft pick has yet to play a preseason game with the Packers after being injured early in training camp last season and landing on injured reserve. The Packers must decide whether or not Abbrederis can contribute to the team this season and if he is a better option than Myles White. White is hanging on to the fifth spot on the depth chart at the moment, after catching nine passes for 89 yards in last Saturday's preseason loss to Philadelphia. Packers coach Mike McCarthy offered no injury update on any of the team's players at his press conference today, including wide receiver Randall Cobb, who was watching practice this afternoon. Packers linebacker Adrian Hubbard also tweeted\u00a0 that he has been released by the Packers today.", "source": "WTAQ News Talk"}
