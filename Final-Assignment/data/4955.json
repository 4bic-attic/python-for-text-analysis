The ethics committee carries out the integrity checks and we [the election committee] will rely heavily on the assessment of the ethics committee.\"This means candidates\u00a0Chung Mong-Joon,\u00a0Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and UEFA's Michel Platini will need to be rubber-stamped by the ethics committee and its checks before they are confirmed worthy to stand for election.Scala is the man tasked with overseeing the next elections for the right to lead world football's governing body. His proposal is clearly intended as an attempt to wipe away some of the stain left by Sepp Blatter's tenure, a period that ended with indictments and the Swiss overseer declaring he'll be\u00a0stepping down.Ziegler also points to Scala's standing as someone who has pushed for major reforms within FIFA in recent months.Still, face-saving gesture or not, Scala's attempts to at least closely monitor the candidates does represent a small step in the right direction for FIFA.
