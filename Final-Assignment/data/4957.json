In seconds we can know the answer to any question, visit any place in the world, buy anything we need or make new friends.\u00a0But in a world where we all are connected online, what has that done to our \u201creal-life\u201d selves? I\u2019m talking to you 20-somethings.\u00a0We grew up with Xanga, Myspace, Twitter and Facebook. We\u2019ve had \u201cAbout me\u201ds, status updates and posts to define ourselves and to tell people anything they\u2019d need to know about us. With the Internet, you can see how someone is doing without really seeing how they\u2019re doing.\u00a0The truth is that our online selves are a better, funnier, prettier, have-my-s***-together-er versions of who we really are.\u00a0 In 2014, on average, we spent TWO hours on social media alone every single day. That\u2019s up a half\u00a0 hour from 2013. \n\nScroll. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Smirk. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Like. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Repeat. \n\nAll while we ignore the real world around us.\u00a0We care more about likes, comments and views than we do conversations.\u00a0Why is it necessary for us to be reminded constantly that these things aren\u2019t important?\u00a0How many times have you found yourself \u201ccreeping\u201d someone on Facebook to find out information instead of just asking them?\u00a0Face-to-face interactions have become awkward, all while a quick text is nothing to us.\u00a0All of this leads me to the question: What in the hell is wrong with us? In a room full of real, live, breathing people, we focus all our energy on a tiny computer in our pockets.\u00a0We say to our friends: put that on Facebook!\u00a0 We take 35 pictures just to get \u201cthe right one.\u201d\u00a0We play out our lives in 15-second intervals for anyone to see. Privacy is somewhat a thing of the past.\u00a0If we didn\u2019t share it online, did it really even happen?\u00a0In most cases, we have turned all-important personal skill building digital.\u00a0Swipe left or right on someone instead of walk up to them; press the add button instead of inviting them over; send a message instead of talking. \u00a0If we continuously are more concerned with what people think we are doing versus what we actually are doing, then what do we have left? \u2013 hundreds or thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d and no one to really talk to? \u00a0As a generation of innovators, we should take a second to ask ourselves: Do I want my son or daughter to live vicariously through a computer? Do I want real memories, or do I want valencia-filtered ones? Do I love myself or just my selfie?", "source": "Amarillo College Ranger"}
