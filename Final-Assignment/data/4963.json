I wanted to talk about my favorite products that I've been reaching for again and again this month:\n1- Sephora The Painter Airbrush Sponge: I'm completely in love with this sponge! I use it to apply my foundation and concealer, and I find it really helps my makeup look more natural and not cakey. I prefer using it dry rather than wet.\n2- White Barn Mahogany Teakwood Scented Candle: This is the perfect fall candle! It smells like a man's cologne. I find the scent so relaxing and comforting.\n3- Viva by Fergie eau de parfum spray (Avon): I love this fragrance for fall and winter! It's a sultry, stronger scent, with notes of lavender and vetiver. I find it almost smells like a feminine version of a man's cologne.\n4- Bright Autumn Day PocketBac by Bath and Body Works: This hand sanitizer is so lovely! It smells like yummy cinnamon with citrus notes. I'm also a fan of the green color!\nWhat have you been loving for September? Thanks for stopping by! xo", "source": "Makeup is Delicious!!"}
