One Republican, Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie, voted \u201cpresent.\u201d \n\nOn a second vote largely along party lines, the House passed legislation stating that the President could not unilaterally lift statutory sanctions. The measure was non-binding, and Senate Republicans have no plans to advance the bill. The vote was 247 to 186, with two Democrats voting with Republicans. \n\nPaving the way for a possible legal challenge, the House passed a non-binding resolution on Thursday stating that the President violated the law by not giving Congress the details on \u201cside deals\u201d to the nuclear agreement related to inspections of Iranian sites, which are government by secret arrangements between Tehran and the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency.", "source": "WGOW 1150 AM"}
