Without some new infusion of money, those percentages will fall \u2014 or more fittingly, crumble. \n \nBy 2021, the department estimates only 62 percent of the highways and 86 percent of the bridges will be rated acceptable. \n \nMagellan said the present funding system, mainly the taxes from fuel sales and vehicle registration, are not increasing. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s less coming in than you want from fuel taxes as vehicles become more efficient and people are driving less,\u201d he said. \u201cRegistration revenues are flat.\u201d \n \nThat leaves not just this region in a difficult position, but the entire state as well. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to keep up with the needs, but you plow forward with the money you have,\u201d he said. \n \nSo, while projects, such as the recently started 6000N Road interchange, begin in Bourbonnais, plans for redevelopment of the I-57 interchange at East Court Street remain in the engineering stage as there are no funds \u2014 easily $30 million to $40 million \u2014 for reconstruction of the out-of-date interchange. \n \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t speculate when that could be funded,\u201d Magolan said. \u201cIt depends on our revenue sources.\u201d \n \nSo, as current funding streams remain flat at best, what options are available? \n \nIncrease of the state\u2019s 19-cent-per-gallon gas tax is an option. The tax hasn\u2019t been increased for 25 years. Developing a formula to tax motorists on how much they drive is another. Selling government bonds is yet another. \n \nNone of them, however, will be met with cheers from the public. \n \n\u201cThe state won\u2019t be able to do what it needs to do with the available funds,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are interesting times.\u201d \n \nConcerning the five-year improvement plan, $7.5 billion comes from federal government and the remainder from state and local sources. \n \nOf the approximate $301 million proposed for District 3 in the five-year plan, Interstate 57 from near Iroquois County to Illinois Route 50 at Bourbonnais will be resurfaced, a total of 11.6 miles. The project includes a new bridge deck under Waldron Road and a new bridge at North Street. Projected cost is $41.5 million. \n \nIllinois Route 102 at Rock Creek, about 6.5 miles northwest of Bourbonnais, also is planned for a new bridge at a cost of $4.3 million. \n \nI-57 from the Champaign County line to the Iroquois County line at Ford County will be resurfaced, a distance of 6.4 miles, and includes bridge and curb repairs at a cost of $15.5 million.", "source": "InOttawa.com"}
