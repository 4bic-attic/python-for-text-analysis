We\u2019ll let him explain it to you in his own words in his last tour diary entry for Celebuzz: \n \nThis week consisted of very little sleep. I dropped my new single \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d performed it on Jimmy Kimmel and toured through Kansas City, Idaho and Minnesota. Amidst all that, I announced that I\u2019m going to be on Dancing with the Stars (and I met and rehearsed with my incredibly talented dance partner, Allison Holker ). It feels like life is moving at hyper speed right now, but who needs sleep? ITS GOOD TO BE ALIVE. \n \nAs for his chances on Dancing with the Stars , Grammer told Billboard magazine , \u201cI am definitely an underdog on this show. There is no doubt about it. I don\u2019t know how to dance and I don\u2019t have any extra flexible skills. There is going to be a lot of molding. I still think I got a shot.\u201d \n \nHe needs your votes everyone! So make sure to tune in and get your dialing digits ready!", "source": "Celebuzz"}
