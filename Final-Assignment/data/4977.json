The newest models, following a hugely popular design overhaul last year that added bigger screens, may not match the success of previous releases, according to analysts. \n\nDemand for the new iPhones appears lower than last year, \u201cpossibly meaningfully so,\u201d said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who studied Google search data, shipment times and third-party surveys. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and RBC Capital Markets also raised concerns about iPhone growth. Since 2013, iPhone sales have increased an average of about 35 per cent each quarter. In\u00a0October to December last year, Apple sold 74.6 million\u00a0iPhones\u2014about 34,000 iPhone purchases per hour. \n\nExpectations are tempered partly because the gadget is at the point in its two-year design cycle that entails less dramatic changes. In the first year, Apple generally overhauls the device\u2019s hardware, including its look and feel. For the following year\u2019s model, designated with an \u201cs\u201d tacked on to the number, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company makes more subtle improvements. \n\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus resemble last year\u2019s versions but sport new features such as 3D Touch, which provides a shortcut for checking mail, taking pictures and other functions when the user presses down on the screen. Apple also added an improved camera and zippier processor. \n\nWhether Apple can match last year\u2019s demand will be determined as handsets hit stores Friday in\u00a0New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, Hong Kong,\u00a0France, Germany, the U.K., Canada, the U.S. and Puerto Rico. They will go on sale in more than 130 countries by year-end, according to Apple. \n\nCustomers around Asia again lined up to be among the first to get their hands on the device. Stores in China\u2014Apple\u2019s largest market outside the U.S.\u2014drew faithful buyers like Wu Kai, who picked up two phones from a packed Apple outlet at Beijing\u2019s Xidan Joycity mall. \n\n\u201cApple products are becoming family members,\u201d the 17-year- old student said, explaining how he and his parents rely on every Apple product from the Mac Pro to the iPad. \u201cIt\u2019s just good product that\u2019s shaping our everyday life.\u201d \n\nCook has said he expects the world\u2019s second-largest economy to eventually become Apple\u2019s largest market. Greater China accounted for 27 percent of revenue in the June quarter, more than all of Europe, and remains a swing factor for the company\u2019s iPhone-reliant earnings. \n\nThere were signs however that iPhone sales there may have slowed, after Apple reported moving 47.5 million units\u00a0in the latest quarter, missing analysts\u2019 projections for 48.8 million. \n\nIn Sydney, hundreds braved heavy rain outside Apple\u2019s city-centre store. Freelance technology journalist\u00a0Lindsay Handmer, 32, waited for 18 days in front of the shop to be the first, showering at a local gym and using the toilets at a McDonald\u2019s. He plans to auction his two new phones for a charity that helps the homeless. \n\nOver in Berlin, about 400 people waited under clear skies on the main shopping boulevard Kurfuerstendamm. First in line was Helge Bruhn, a 47-year-old Berliner who had camped outside the Apple store for seven days. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere, and about meeting new friends,\u201d he said, shortly before the shop opened to cheers from the customers. \n\nAbout 200 people waited outside Apple\u2019s store on London\u2019s Regent Street, then cheered and applauded as the doors opened. First customers sported beaming smiles and gave out high-five\u2019s, hugs and handshakes while pumping their fist in the air and holding up their purchase proudly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve queued up for past iPhone launches all around the world\u2014last time it was in New York,\u201d said Moey Shawash, 31, who flew in from South Africa to be the first in line. \u201cI am so excited about its new color, re-engineered model, 3D Touch and camera.\u201d \n\nA smooth release is critical for Apple, which generates more than 60 per cent of its revenue from the phone. Cook is attempting to expand other businesses, but the portion of sales coming from the iPhone continues to grow. The Apple Watch hasn\u2019t become a mainstream success and iPad sales are in decline. \n\nThe iPhone\u2019s weight in Apple\u2019s results has put further investor focus on the device\u2019s performance. The stock through Thursday was down 14 per cent from its high in February, in part because of concerns that the device can\u2019t sustain its run of unprecedented growth. The shares rose 0.6 per cent to the equivalent of $115.68 in German trading at 10:08 a.m. in Frankfurt. \n\nApple last week predicted it would top last year\u2019s opening- weekend sales record of 10 million units, although that figure is boosted by availability this year in China, which wasn\u2019t part of the initial rollout last year.\u00a0A better gauge for how the device is selling will come in January, when the company reports sales for the holiday quarter. \n\n\u201cThe biggest area of interest for investors is the December quarter. The major concern is whether they won\u2019t be able to grow off that very difficult comparable to last year,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York, who is predicting an 8 per cent rise in shipments to 80 million. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grow the number of phones you\u2019re selling, you\u2019re not going to grow earnings.\u201d", "source": "MSN Money Canada"}
