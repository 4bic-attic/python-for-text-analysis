The decision regarding just how much they owe was announced Wednesday by the state Attorney General\u2019s Office. \n \n\u201cOnline travel companies derive substantial profits from the sale of hotel rooms, rental cars and other services in Hawaii,\u201d Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a press release . \u201cThe importance of the Hawaii Supreme Court ruling is the precedent it establishes. People or companies who provide goods and services through the Internet that are used or consumed in Hawaii are subject to Hawaii taxation, despite being domiciled in other states.\u201d \n \nIn the ruling last March,\u00a0the Supreme Court said the companies are subject to Hawaii\u2019s general excise tax, but concluded that they are taxable only on their net receipts from the sale of hotel rooms in Hawaii, not their gross receipts. \n \n\u201cLitigation against the companies for their other State tax obligations for their other business activities in Hawaii during the period 2000 through 2013 is continuing,\u201d Chin said in the release. \n \nWhen online travel companies book Hawaii hotel rooms, they must pay the state\u2019s general excise tax. \n\nCory Lum/Civil Beat \u2026 \n  \n Loading \u2026", "source": "Civil Beat"}
