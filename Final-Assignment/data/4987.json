However, WTI has quickly managed to leave the selling mood behind, gathering traction and recovering the $45 handle albeit still in the red territory. \n\nRenewed jitters on the oil supply glut plus the usual unease regarding the Chinese economy continue to do the rounds amongst oil investors, who saw the barrel climb more than 25% in three consecutive sessions (Thursday to Monday). \n\nWTI levels to watch \n\nAt the moment WTI is down 0.33% at $45.26 facing the immediate support at $43.21 (low Sep.2) ahead of $41.78 (low Aug.28) and finally $38.95 (low Aug.27). On the flip side, a break above $48.85 (high Sep.1) would aim for $49.03 (high Jul.31) and then $49.91 (high Jul.29).", "source": "FXStreet.com"}
