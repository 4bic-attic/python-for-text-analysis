One of my favorite ways to mix things up when it comes to making interesting salads is to hit up my local Farmers Market. And if there\u2019s a stand that sells fresh Burrata, I will buy it every.single.time. For this particular salad, I wanted to take advantage of all of the beautiful fresh fruit I found at the market. The mix of fresh raspberries and apricots went great with the tangy aged balsamic. Plus, it\u2019s so bright and colorful \u2013 always a welcome sight when making a salad. I keep a stash of different seeds and nuts in my freezer, and it\u2019s the perfect way to add a bit of crunch to salads. This time around, I went with some shelled, roasted sunflower seeds. YUM. To make this salad, I mounded\u00a0a big pile of baby arugula on a plate. I topped it with a handful of fresh raspberries, a few fresh apricots that I sliced up, a ball of fresh Burrata, cut in half so the center would start to spill out, roasted sunflower seeds, snipped garden chives, gray salt, fresh cracked black pepper, and a drizzle of robust olive oil and aged balsamic. This was a fantastic, colorful salad that I really enjoyed. It would work with lots of different fruits, too. I\u2019d recommend keeping it to 2 or maybe 3 so things don\u2019t get too complicated. Enjoy the freshness! \u00a0 Related PostsRed, White & Blue Spinach Salad with Fresh BurrataAsian Broccoli SlawStraight Outta Comt\u00e9 Leftover SaladGreen, Blue and Red Winter SaladSpiced Butternut Squash, Lentil, and Goat Cheese Salad", "source": "Big Flavors from a Tiny Kitchen"}
