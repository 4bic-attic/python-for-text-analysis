(September 22, 2015)  \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. , Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --The Byrds said it best when they sang, \"To everythingthere is a season\". In warehousing and distribution, we must decide how we plan for these changing seasons in order to be able to react effectively to increases or decreases in both the supply (inventory) and demand (throughput). Since consumer spending accounts for around 70% of our gross domestic product and most retailer's earn their profit during the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's , we will use the typical retailer's holiday rush to remind us of what we need to do in order to stay ahead of this year's peak season and prepare for next year's holiday season as our businesses continue to grow. \n  \nPlanning and designing the material handling system for a new distribution center is complicated with many variables that affect the labor force strategy and seasonality requirements. The basis for the design is derived from historical and reasonably assumed future data. The storage system design accounts for the product velocities and a disciplined slotting plan for differing seasons. The throughput capacity is calculated with key variables related to the peak vs off-peak system throughput capacity and labor force utilization plans. Therefore, when it is time to design your next distribution center, consider your storage and throughput strategies with the changing seasons in mind. \n \nTo view the full white paper by TriFactor, LLC, please visit \nhttp://www.trifactor.com/Designing-A-Material-Handling-System \n\n \nFor other TriFactor white papers, articles or our newsletter, please visit the TriFactor Learning Center at http://www.trifactor.com/TriFactor-Learning-Center \n \nAbout TriFactor \n \nTriFactor is a material handling systems integrator that specializes in the design and implementation of conveyor systems , storage systems, and order picking, packing, and shipping systems for warehouses and distribution centers.
