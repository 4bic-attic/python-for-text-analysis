It is really ok.\u00a0 I\u2019ve felt it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tasted it\u2026been there I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want it again Of course I do But it\u2019s not there It\u2019s a ghost And some don\u2019t ever get to even see the ghost Let alone feel it Taste it Touch it Become one with it Flesh and bone heart words soul hope future fear quiet and screams All together Tasted in a sour soup of sweet tangy passion", "source": "Glass Blasting Memoirs"}
