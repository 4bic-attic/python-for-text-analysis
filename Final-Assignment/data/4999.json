According to recent bend tests , this has resulted in an iPhone that is noticeably much more durable than its predecessor. However the money question is how will the new iPhone 6s with a 7000 series aluminum build hold up against a 50 caliber rifle? \n \nWe suppose the answer is already pretty obvious but in case you\u2019re curious to see how much destruction a 50 caliber sniper can do to the iPhone, you\u2019re in luck. The folks at FullMag have recently released a new video in which they pit the iPhone 6s against a 50 caliber rifle, with the rifle winning, naturally. \n \nThis isn\u2019t the first time the folks at FullMag have used a 50 caliber rifle. Previously we have seen them use it to destroy other devices, like the PlayStation 4 which met its untimely and gruesome demise at the hands of a bullet, so safe to say we expect no less, if not more, with the iPhone 6s\u2019 wanton destruction. \n \nPrior to this, FullMag released a video in which they froze the iPhone 6s in liquid nitrogen before smashing it to bits with a sledgehammer. In any case if you have a couple of minutes to spare, check out the video above for the details. It looks like the 7000 series aluminum never even stood a chance! \n \n\r\n                            Filed in Apple > Cellphones .
