The Republican politician served as Vice President under George W Bush for eight years, from 2001 to 2008, as the administration took a hardline stance on gay issues. He backed equal marriage in 2009, though a split in his family\u00a0became clear\u00a0when\u00a0lesbian daughter Mary Cheney slammed\u00a0her sister Liz Cheney, for opposing her right to marry. This week,\u00a0Cheney suggested that following the Supreme Court ruling bringing same-sex marriage, to all 50 states, people must \u201cgo forward\u201d rather than continue to resist. Referring to a clerk who is still resisting\u00a0the ruling, he told Newsmax: \u201cI don\u2019t know the details of the case, but the Supreme Court has ruled on the subject of same-sex marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s the law of the land and as a general proposition, it seems to me you\u2019ve got to go forward with it.\u201d In the same interview, Liz Cheney added: \u201cAs my dad said, it is the law of the land. \u201cThe court has ruled\u2026 [the clerk] is\u00a0not an employee of a church or synagogue, she\u2019s a government employee. So, she has an obligation to uphold the law.\u201d Liz Cheney\u2019s own turn-around on the issue comes despite the fact she opposed\u00a0her own sister\u2019s right to marry less than two years ago, when she said \u201cthe people themselves\u201d should decide. She said in 2013: \u201cI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.\u201d Mary Cheney and her partner Heather Poe hit back: \u201cLiz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children.\u00a0To have her now say she doesn\u2019t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.\u201d The family now appears happily united in favour of equality.
