What you'll need: Crust: 1 cup pitted dates (soaked in warm water for 10 minutes then drained) 1 cup raw walnuts or almonds Filling: 1.5 cups raw cashews, quick soaked* 1 large lemon, juiced (1/4 cup) 1/3 cup coconut oil, melted 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk\u00a0 1/2 cup agave nectar or maple syrup (or honey if not vegan) Optional Flavor Add-Ins: 2 Tbsp natural peanut butter 1/4 cup blueberries (fresh or frozen) What to do: Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside. Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. Lightly grease a 12 hole muffin tin. To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of baking paper and lay them in the holes. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen. Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of date mix and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. Set in freezer to firm up. Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. \u00a0If adding peanut butter, add to the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with blueberry, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes. Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours. Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter knife. They should pop right out.\u00a0 Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.\u00a0\nPin It", "source": "Twins, Plus One"}
