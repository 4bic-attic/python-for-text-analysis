These drivers have taken it very personally,\" DeLapp said. \"These bus drivers care deeply about all of the students and staff that they drive every day.\" \n\nPTC will be pushing for electronic notification devices to be placed in school buses and two adults will now monitor every bus. The chartered bus company has also donated $10,000 to the Lee family, DeLapp said. \n\nThe Lee family questions how Paul could have been overlooked. They said there were only three other students who rode their son's bus and he was the last one to board. \n\nThe trip to Sierra Educational Center's Transition Program from his home lasts about six minutes and Paul was not a small person. He was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed almost 300 pounds. \n\nHis family has set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for his funeral expenses.", "source": "DailyNews724.com"}
