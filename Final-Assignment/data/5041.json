(Scott Dippel/CBC) \n  \nSo the city has agreed to pay $25 million to construct the\u00a0berm\u00a0and a new pumping system to protect the popular downtown Calgary attraction from a similar disaster in the future. \n \nZoo Road will close in December as work gets underway, and remain out of service until June 2017. However it will reopen temporarily for next summer's tourist season in July and August. \n \nArea\u00a0Coun.\u00a0Gian-Carlo\u00a0Carra\u00a0says he expects it will be a minor inconvenience for traffic. \n \n\"It's\u00a0nice to have a connection to Inglewood and it's nice-to-have connection to the zoo island and the parking lot there and St. Patrick's Island. But it's not a critical link in the city's road connectivity,\" he said. \n  \nOnce Zoo Road reopens in about a year and a half, a berm will be in place along St. George's Island to protect the route and the adjacent zoo from future flooding. (Scott Dippel/CBC) \n  \n\"It experiences a tremendous amount of commuter traffic one time of the day \u2014 on the evening drive home as opposed to the morning rush \u2014 because it's just not conveniently located for that and you know, those cars will find other routes as they always do.\" \n \nThe bridge at 12th Street will stay open during construction. \n \nBut that century-old span will be torn down once it is replaced by a new bridge slated to be erected just west of it. \n \nConstruction on that $19-million project will start in the spring and be finished by 2", "source": "CBC"}
