The UK recently reached its highest level of employment since records began some 45 years ago but it\u2019s clear that some cities are performing better than others. Let\u2019s take a look. Narrowing down the search Surprisingly, Edinburgh is the best city in the UK for growth in job vacancies \u2013 posting a staggering 79% more job adverts in April 2015 than at the same time last year. By comparison, London saw a growth rate of 42% with almost 22,500 jobs posted in April out of a nationwide total of 134,232 based in the English capital. Sales professionals looking for roles in and around Birmingham are also in for some good news as the city had the second highest growth rate; a 54% increase of 7,866 jobs being posted. Manchester and Liverpool each saw a 47% rise in job vacancies so there is plenty of hope there too. Competition gets fierce While it\u2019s great to see so many more job vacancies available throughout the cities in the UK, sales professionals need to be prepared to fight for the role they want. With more than 10,000 people applying for 861 jobs in April 2015 (that\u2019s an average of 12 people applying for each job), it\u2019s important that professionals ensure they stand out for the right reasons. For those hoping to join the London rat-race the need is even greater as an average 23 people applied for each role on offer here. While it is great news that there are more sales jobs out there, with competition remaining stiff it\u2019s vital that you showcase skills and experience on your CV and in an interview.
