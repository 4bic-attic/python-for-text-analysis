The bill would totally restrict tanning bed access for those younger than 18, as opposed to the current state law, which requires parental consent for teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 who wish to tan. Now that the proposal has been passed by the senate, it will move to the Massachusetts House of Representatives at some point before July of next year. \n \n\u201cTanning beds are carcinogenic. The World Health Organization classifies them in the same category as tobacco and asbestos,\u201d says Marc Hymovitz, director of government relations for ACS CAN Massachusetts. \u201cYouth under the age of 18, their skin is still developing. They\u2019re susceptible to cancer, frankly. If you use a tanning device before the age of 35, you have a 59 percent greater chance of getting melanoma than if you don\u2019t use an indoor tanning device.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the senate\u2019s 38-0 vote, a number of prominent Massachusetts organizations, like Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts Public Health Association, backed the proposal. If the bill is ultimately passed, Massachusetts will join states nationwide, including New Hampshire and Vermont, in banning tanning for minors. \n \n\u201cThe incidence of melanoma across the country has doubled in the last 30 years, and that\u2019s in the same time frame that indoor tanning devices have become used more,\u201d Hymovitz says. \u201cThe hope, and the thought, and the belief is that if we prohibit youths from using these products, we\u2019ll reduce the deaths caused by them.\u201d", "source": "Boston Magazine"}
