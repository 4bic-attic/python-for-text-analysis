With one of the best pre-seasons I have ever seen at Pulborough, we are focussing much more of our time on our game play and phases. Which really showed in our friendlies. \n\n\u201cI am looking forward to this weekend. The team is looking in great condition and our set phases are really coming together nicely which gives us plenty of options across the park.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nPulborough have signed a new number eight in Andy Hodgkinson and been boosted by fly-half Sam Aviss, who will travel back from university, and Charlie Denman, who will travel from London. \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live. \n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on. \n\n1 Make this website your homepage \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n2 Like our Facebook page at facebook.com/pages/Sport-Sussex \n\n3 Follow us on Twitter @SportSussex \n\n4 Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).
