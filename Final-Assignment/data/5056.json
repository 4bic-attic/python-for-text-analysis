His name is Bobby Turner.\n\nBobby is one of the 1-in-1,000 men diagnosed with what's typically considered a women's disease.\n\n\"I found out when I felt my own knot on my chest this past February,\u201d the 39-year-old said. \u201cThe whole time I thought, surely not.\"\n\nBut it was. Doctors diagnosed him with breast cancer. \n\nBobby had beaten leukemia as a child, when he was 16. He says doctors told him the treatments from his childhood cancer might be what caused his breast cancer.\n\nIn April, Bobby had a mastectomy. He\u2019s currently in the middle of intense chemo treatments. Radiation comes next.\n\n\"I\u2019m tired and worn down right now,\u201d he says. \u201cMostly because I\u2019m still trying to work through all of it. I have to. I need the insurance and just because I\u2019m sick doesn\u2019t mean bills stop coming.\"\n\nBobby works at SQI in Hickory - a company connected to the automobile industry. He said his bosses understand his situation and are very supportive.\n\nNext Saturday, October 3rd, Bobby and his mom, Vanessa, and his fianc\u00e9e Monica, are all going to be at Komen Charlotte\u2019s \u201cRace for the Cure\u201d. They\u2019ve never been. It\u2019ll be their first trip there.\n\nYou can get more information on the Race at KomenCharlotte.org.\n\nOr, sign up for our WBTV team!
