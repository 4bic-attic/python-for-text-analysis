In fact, all seven are staunchly not the kind of do-everything device the company attempted with the Fire Phone. With four tablets and two set-top boxes, Amazon made a single statement: We win at entertainment. You want to draw, futz with spreadsheets, or map the human genome? Great. Buy an iPad (preferably on Amazon.com!). But if you\u2019re a Prime member looking for a way to watch movies, read books, or listen to music, Amazon believes firmly there\u2019s no better way than with Amazon. And honestly, it makes a pretty compelling case. Before we go further, here are the seven new devices: \u2022 A faster Fire TV box with 4K support: $99.99 \u2022 A new Fire TV Stick with Voice Search and Alex voice control: $39.99 \u2022 A 10.1-inch Kindle Fire HD tablet: $229 \u2022 Same thing, 8 inches: $149.99 \u2022 A 7-inch Fire tablet for the super-cheap: $49.99 \u2022 The kids\u2019 version with a bumper and a two-year replacement guarantee: $99.99 Whew! There are a few highlights worth pointing out: The Fire TV\u2019s 4K support (and Amazon\u2019s impressive selection of 4K content) is a huge upgrade, not to mention a pointed victory over the new Apple TV. Alexa integration means you get almost all the capability\u00a0of the voice-powered Amazon Echo box, right on your TV. The tablets have bigger screens than before, but are thinner and still pretty easy to hold. Everything\u2014everything\u2014is created with reading and watching in mind. The new tablets also come with a completely redesigned version of their operating system called Fire OS 5. Next to the carousel-filled, dark-on-dark interfaces Amazon\u2019s built before, Fire OS 5 is a refreshing and desperately needed change. Now, you get a light background and a grid of content; your favorite stuff on one page, your recent stuff on another, all your movies on another yet. It feels usable, really for the first time. And there\u2019s a reason: Amazon has finally figured out exactly what the Fire devices are about. Remember that old maxim \u201ctablets are for consumption?\u201d As other big companies like Apple and Microsoft have fought tooth and nail to prove they\u2019re more than just movie-watching devices, Amazon\u2019s leaning into the idea. These are devices for watching movies. And reading books, and watching TV shows, and listening to music. Thing is, Amazon is really, really good at those things. And there are lots of people who want them. Amazon\u2019s proven it can make good hardware and sell it for less than most of its competitors. That\u2019s true here too: the new Fire HD tablets are thin and light, and still impressively durable. During his demonstrations, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s head of devices, pulled out an iPad Air and a Fire HD that had gone through equivalent tests. The iPad\u2019s screen was shattered; the Fire\u2019s plastic was scuffed but the device was otherwise perfect. They have decently loud speakers, lots of nice accessories, the whole nine yards. Even the $50 model looks pretty good! On the TV side, the Fire TV has been maybe the best set-top box on the market since the day it came out. (Or at least since whatever day it finally got HBO.) Now, with Alexa, the voice search should be even more useful. There\u2019s a new controller for gaming, a bunch of upgraded hardware inside the box, and improvements to the ASAP feature that pre-caches video to make it play faster. And not only do the new set-top boxes offer 4K streaming, they use a better kind of video encoding (called HEVC) that uses less bandwidth to stream video. That means you\u2019re more likely to get a high-def stream, even when you have a bad connection. Every good new feature of the new devices exists in service of one single thing: content. Books, music, movies, TV shows, games, all the things you do when you\u2019re not doing the work everybody else wants you to do on their tablets. When Amazon does its job well, it makes finding and consuming stuff easier than anyone else. There are plenty of gaps in Amazon\u2019s content ecosystem, sure. And let\u2019s not forget that you\u2019re still paying $99 a year for access, on top of the price of your device. (If you\u2019re not already a Prime subscriber, any Fire device basically morphs into one unending Prime commercial.) But Amazon has integrated so many other sources\u2014there are 3,000 channels, apps, and games for Fire TV, they say\u2014that anything you can\u2019t find from Amazon you can probably get from Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Sling, or, I don\u2019t know, the Red Bull channel. It\u2019s tough to beat the Fire ecosystem when it comes to the size of the content firehose. Now, the products are finally focused on this core competency and little else. Rather than blindly assume everyone lives entirely within Amazon\u2019s ecosystem\u2014which has proven a road to ruin\u2014the company\u2019s just hoping people want to watch some movies. After years of trying to find itself, Amazon finally seems to have a clear sense of what its own devices are for. It\u2019s finally not competing with the iPad and Rokus of the world. These devices are mostly just another benefit to Prime customers, like two-day shipping or the super-cheap grocery shopping options. That clarity of purpose seems to have come with a certain clarity of execution, too. Amazon\u2019s devices should be good enough to make that content easy to access, and as cheap as physically possible. (Someday, we\u2019ll all get these devices free with our Prime subscriptions.) Amazon\u2019s software should be insanely easy to use, and its recommendations should be so good you never run out of stuff to do. Once all that happens\u2014and the new devices are a pretty big step in that direction\u2014Amazon\u2019s going to have a hell of a device lineup on its hands. Just as long as it doesn\u2019t try making any more phones. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazonfirefire hdgalleryKindlestreaming tvtablets\tSkip Social. Skip to: Latest News.
