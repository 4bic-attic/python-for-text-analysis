(Pic: Supplied) Source: Supplied DILVIN YASA Source: News Corp Australia You and I have never met but you\u2019re probably frightened of me. At the very least you\u2019re almost certainly frightened by the idea of me. If you look closely at my photo however, you might have trouble placing exactly what it is that you should be frightened of. And perhaps this is my biggest point, because usually it isn\u2019t obvious \u2014 not even if you\u2019ve worked by my side for a solid decade.\n\nThose people currently threatening to swarm our nation to bleed our country dry and destroy our unique way of life? Yep, I\u2019m one of them and not only that, I\u2019m ticking every box in that great list of People You Would Rather See Die Than Come Live In Our Country. Middle-Eastern, Muslim \u2014 once I finish writing this, you probably think I\u2019m going to studiously stockpile my ammo as I rant to Centerlink about increasing my payments. Then I\u2019m going to make a detailed plan on how to turn Australia into the next Iran. There won\u2019t be many words \u2014 just a lot of pictures using the words \u201cKa-Pow\u201d \u2014 ammiriiight?\n\nLet me tell you what I\u2019ll really be doing. I\u2019ll be finishing off a feature on the future of breast cancer research, speaking to a few TV producers about some segments I\u2019ll be filming later this month and then I\u2019ll be enjoying a cold hard drink with mates at the end of the day.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing that differentiates the two of us however \u2014 before I go to bed, I will take a moment to thank the universe my parents moved to Australia long before I was born, just as I have done every single night of my life since I was a child. And that they were able to do so in a way where there was little risk of my brothers\u2019 tiny bodies washing up on a random beach.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point you\u2019re probably thinking \u2014 but you\u2019re nothing like those people on the news! You don\u2019t wear a headscarf! You were born here! And I\u2019m here to tell you that the only difference between me and those dead children is mode of transport.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate that my parents were able to come here \u2014 by plane \u2014 45 years ago and be welcomed with open arms. I\u2019m lucky that they chose a time when the common local sentiment wasn\u2019t \u201cturn back the boats\u201d and the remedy to leave people like my parents to die or rot behind bars.\n\nThe key fear is that \u201cthese people\u201d will bleed our welfare system dry and trample all over our way of life. I have no doubt in my mind that had little Aylan and his mother and brother lived and they\u2019d miraculously been given asylum in Australia, they would have eventually blended in so that you would never have guessed their background.\n\nLike my parents, they would have worked 15 hour days and paid their taxes to contribute to the country sheltering their babies. They would have assimilated like my parents did \u2014 putting up Christmas trees and dressing up as the Easter bunny so that their children didn\u2019t grow up feeling like Syrian kids growing up in Australia, but feel like regular Australians.\n\nAnd the kids? They would have worked bloody hard to create the kind of life that would make their parents proud. One that made their parents glad they left everyone they ever loved behind in their home country. Like me and my brothers, the kids would probably have married Australians and raised children who are unable to speak their grandparents\u2019 mother tongue.\n\nAnd you know what? I have no doubt that every night before each member of Aylan\u2019s family went to sleep, they would thank the universe that a country like Australia existed and that they could make their home in it. Just as we\u2019ve always done.\n\nSo the next time you\u2019re looking at images of desperate asylum seekers and you find yourself thinking you don\u2019t want \u201cthem\u201d in your country, that they\u2019re too different and that they\u2019ll never fit in, take another look at my photo and reconsider your position.\n\nOriginally published as", "source": "Brisbane Courier-Mail"}
