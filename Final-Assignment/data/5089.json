Your body will be attuned to sunlight, and you're not conscious of it because it reports to the hypothalamus, not sight.\" \n\nHe noted that staff and students are usually sleep deprived and called the problem an \"international issue.\" \n\nKelly and researchers at Oxford University are currently recruiting 100 schools around the United Kingdom to take part in a study on delayed school start times and student performance. \n\nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter.\u00a0 \n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EVoT7E \nTOP VIDEOS 0) { %> \n0) { %> \n\n0) { %>", "source": "13NewsNow.com"}
