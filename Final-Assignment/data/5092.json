He is now practicing in full. Unfortunately for Smith he has lost his job after having his face broken in a locker room dispute. He will serve as the backup to Ryan Fitzpatrick. Fantasy Analysis:\nThere is no reason to own Smith in any leagues. The Jets resident punching bag isn't worth having on your roster if he was the starter, so you certainly don't want him while he's the backup. There is a very good chance he takes over at quarterback when Fitzpatrick inevitably losses a few games in a row and throws four interceptions in a game. When Smith does become the starter, still don't pick him up.", "source": "Fantasy Football Toolbox Updates"}
