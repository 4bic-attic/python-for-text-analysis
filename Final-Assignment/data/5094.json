That change in behaviour is boosting footfall on local high streets to the potential benefit of independents. \n \nMeanwhle, with an improving economic outlook, health has been rising up the consumer agenda. 60% of shoppers polled by Neilsen said they were \u201cactively looking for healthier options\u201d when food shopping, with 33% saying their main focus is \u201clongevity and maintaining good health\u201d (tellingly, in 2015 \u201creducing sugar intake\u201d has replaced \u201cgetting my five-a-day\u201d as consumers\u2019 number one health priority). \n \n\u201c34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer\u201d \n \nEco and organic brands are also likely to benefit from shoppers\u2019 \u201cwider ethical expectations\u201d, says Nielsen. 67% of shoppers said they like to support local businesses and farmers, while 34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer.", "source": "www.naturalproductsonline.co.uk"}
