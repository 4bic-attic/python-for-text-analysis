DNA testing confirmed their identity, and the family was laid to rest in 1998 in St. Petersburg. The Russian Orthodox Church canonized the family in 2000, AP reported.\n\nBecause two of the remaining family members were unaccounted for in the mass grave, rumors persisted that two of the czar's children escaped the attack that took the lives of the rest of the royal family. In 2007, the legend seemed to be put to rest when bones fragments of the czar's other two children, Crown Prince Alexei, 13, and Grand Duchess Maria, 19, were found in a nearby grave.\n\nWhile forensic experts confirmed that the remains were likely those of Alexi and Maria, the Russian Orthodox Church requested the case be reopened, Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian Investigative Committee told the Russian news agency Tass.\n\nThe church wants fool-proof confirmation that the remains belong to the missing prince and princess before they are buried alongside the royal family, BBC reported.\n\n\"The leadership of the Investigative Committee has decided to resume the preliminary investigation to conduct additional studies and investigative steps,\" Markin told Interfax. \n\nIn addition to exhuming the bodies, tissue from family members buried in Jerusalem has been obtained, as well as blood samples from Nicholas' grandfather's bloodstained uniform, Markin told Tass.", "source": "USA Today"}
