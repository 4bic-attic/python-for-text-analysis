It has been months, if not years, of hard work in preparing for this event. \n \n\"To all the people of Gloucester it is great to be here. I joined the club just over a year ago and I have really enjoyed getting to know the city. \n \n\"I have been explaining to the boys how much you love rugby and they could see it as we drove through the city. But I have one small plea. \n \n\"Japan will be playing in cherry and white on Wednesday so for once please could you put that to one side. It would be much appreciated. \n \n\"We look forward to seeing you all at Kingsholm on Wednesday.\" \n \nThe ceremony culminated with a beat-boxing performance by local act Duke. \n \nGloucester Cathedral is among 17 landmark venues across England and Wales chosen to host Welcome Ceremonies. \n \nIt is predicted to be the biggest boost for the UK's travel and tourism industry since the London Olympics three years ago, pumping almost \u00a31billion into the economy during the next month and a half.", "source": "Punchline"}
