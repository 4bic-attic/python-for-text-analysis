According to cyber security experts, the frequency and severity of  cyber-attacks are on the rise, causing alarm to businesses and customers  across a variety of industries. To defend against exploits like these, a  company must adopt a comprehensive security defense strategy that is  designed for their business. In 2015, organizations such as United  Airlines, Sony Corp, Anthem and the Office of Personnel Management  experienced data breaches through malware and other targeted attacks.  How will your business adapt to this shift in technology while keeping  its security posture? \n \nIn his session at 17th Cloud Expo ,  Stephen Coty, Chief Security Evangelist at Alert Logic, will take you  into the evolving world of cybercrime and give you an insider's look  into the tactics utilized by fast, well-funded and organized attackers.  He will review real examples and case studies of recent breaches, and  you will learn expert strategies for protecting your information in the  cloud. \n \nDiscussion includes: \n An expert profile of today's evolved hackers and threat landscape.  What attackers are really after, why, and how they're getting what they want.  Strategies you can implement in the cloud to protect against attacks.  \nSpeaker Bio \nStephen Coty is the Chief Security Evangelist  at Alert Logic in Houston TX.
