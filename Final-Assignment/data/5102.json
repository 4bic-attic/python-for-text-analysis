Police said that some people in the crowd were seen lobbing live grenades at officers. At least four of those injured were said to be in serious condition, and the casualties included troops who had fought against pro-Russia separatists in\u00a0eastern Ukraine. \n \nThe violence occurred after a vote to amend Ukraine\u2019s constitution to allow greater autonomy for local governments was introduced Monday. Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko has backed the deal --\u00a0negotiated in February with the help of several Western countries --\u00a0as a key part of a peace agreement between Kiev and the breakaway regions in the country\u2019s east. \n \nHowever, nationalists and other opponents of the bill said that it would grant too much autonomy to the rebel-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\u00a0In a video address after the incident, Poroshenko praised the vote as a step toward the peace agreement and condemned the violence as a \u201cstab in the back,\u201d promising tough security measures against those\u00a0involved,\u00a0BBC reported . \n \nThe protesters were reportedly affiliated with the populist Radical Party movement and the ultranationalist Svoboda (Freedom) Party. \n \nUkrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov\u00a0reportedly\u00a0said that about 30 people had been detained, including one Svoboda member who had confessed to throwing a grenade. \n \nHowever, Svoboda said in a statement that the police had\u00a0initiated the fighting, and that the\u00a0government had\u00a0\u201cprovoked Ukrainians to protest\u201d against the proposed bill, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n \nAt the end of the debate, 265 of 450 lawmakers backed the first reading of the bill, which\u00a0must get a constitutional majority of at least 300 votes in its second reading before it can come into effect. The date for the next reading has not been decided yet.\u00a0 \n \nHowever, the bill\u2019s passage is far from certain. Three parties in Poroshenko\u2019s own ruling coalition voted against the bill, including the party of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The debate over the bill turned rowdy when opposing lawmakers attempted to disrupt the vote by chanting slogans and drowning out the discussion with an amplified siren.", "source": "International Business Times"}
