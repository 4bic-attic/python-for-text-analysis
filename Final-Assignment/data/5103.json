My answer is yes.\" \n\nThe Prime Minister was untroubled by a scathing attack on Australia's approach to border protection by The New York Times newspaper, saying the most compassionate thing a country could to in the medium to long term was shut down the people smuggling trade. \n\n\"It's obviously a crisis right now on the borders of Europe and I think a lot of people right around the world are looking at what we've done and said, 'Well, if Australia can stop the people smuggling trade, if Australia can end the deaths at sea, perhaps we can learn from them'.\" \n\nAn editorial in the newspaper described Mr Abbott's policies as \"inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war\". \n\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale has written to Ms Bishop and \u00a0Mr\u00a0 Dutton requesting the increase. \"Four million people are fleeing war in Syria. Two million of those are children. To welcome 20,000 of them into our community would be such an honourable and dignified response from Australia,\" Senator Di Natale said. \n\n\"Australia has an opportunity to do something great here. We have the strength, the capacity and the generosity to support people who are seeking safety,\" said Greens immigration spokeswoman Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. \n\nAnoop Sukumaran, executive director of the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said a substantial increase in Australia's refugee intake would help rebuild the credibility lost as a result of this country's \"extreme\" and \"draconian\" refugee policies. \n\nOxfam Australia's Dr Helen Szoke backed the intake increase and called on governments to improve infrastructure and support local economic development, education and health programs in neighbouring countries, to ensure people living in crisis-affected communities and refugees can access basic services. \n\nMr Joyce was touched by the personal story of a man whose plastic bag of water bottles and a packet of biscuits were his only possessions in the world. \n\n\"As an accountant myself, when you see an accountant walking across the border into Hungary from Syria when his life has been destroyed I feel a sense of empathy for him,\" Mr Joyce told The West Australian . \n\nFollow us on Twitter \n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .", "source": "Cessnock Advertiser"}
