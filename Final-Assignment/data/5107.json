Everyone chipped in and helped,\u201d Ms Uebergang explained.\n\nThe bride's bouquet.

Picture: EDWINA ROBERTSON PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n\u201cI felt so touched she had obviously felt the importance of the community and how much joy a wedding had brought to our community when she was out there,\u201d Ms Uebergang said.\n\nOn Tuesday at 8pm, photographer Edwina Robertson posted on her Facebook page an offer to personally pledge $3 to the Tie Up the Black Dog (TUBD) organisation for every share of the picture within 24 hours.\n\nThe photo went viral, receiving 4974 shares and reaching 430,000 people on the social media network.\n\nMs Robertson has since confirmed she\u2019ll donate $15,000 to TUBD.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a fantastic cause. Everyone knows about the drought, but you just hear all the bad and this is a good thing that has come out of it,\u201d Ms Uebergang said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to take 160 guests to the Blackall community any they\u2019ve been able to be part and spend money in my community for a few days.\n\n\u201cNow, Eddie has been able to share it with everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe story first appeared on Queensland Country Life.", "source": "Lithgow Mercury"}
