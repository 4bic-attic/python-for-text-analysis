This one is a James Bond special edition to celebrate the new movie\u00a0SPECTRE,\u00a0offered exclusively from Vodafone UK. Anyone who buys the Bond Edition Z5 will have the chance to download some special edition\u00a0SPECTRE themes and\u00a0content. Not only that, but there are also prizes and special offers to make this deal even more exciting. The 007 edition Xperia Z5 will still feature all the same features that make it just as great as the normal one such as: 23 MP camera, 2-day battery life, world\u2019s fastest autofocus, and more. However, the exclusive content this Bond version will have\u00a0are: official Bond themes, wallpapers, and a behind the scene blog from Miss Moneypenny herself which can all be downloaded from the Xperia Lounge. Nice so far, but that is not the best part. Anyone who pre-orders will be entered into a draw to win\u00a0one of 50 Aston Martin experience days, that\u00a0allows you to drive a variety\u00a0of\u00a0Aston Martin cars. Plus,\u00a0Vodafone UK say if you pre-order or buy the Bond phone you can get a huge savings on a Sony Action Cam Mini so you can film your trip. But that\u2019s not all! If you pre-order or order the Xperia Z5 Bond phone on one of our \u00a349 Red 4GB Value 4G bundles, you\u2019ll be able to buy a Sony AZ1VR Action Cam Mini for just \u00a349, saving you a massive \u00a3200 on the RRP and letting you film your exploits in style. The Bond Xperia Z5 will be available for pre-order September 16th, at\u00a0Vodafone UK.
