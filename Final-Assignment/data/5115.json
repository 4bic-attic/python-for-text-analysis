Steven Gerrard A Liverpool supporter has denied a public order offence involving disabled fans during Steven Gerrard\u2019s last home game. Jonathan Luke Poulter, 20, of Chapel Road, Anfield, is alleged to have been involved in a disturbance in the Anfield stands as Liverpool faced Crystal Palace on May 16. The game was the last time Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard appeared for the club, before moving to LA Galaxy after an illustrious 17-year-career. Sefton Magistrates\u2019 Court heard the incident occurred after a complaint by disabled fans that a Gerrard banner waved by Poulter was blocking their view. Poulter pleaded not guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress under Section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986. District Judge Richard Clancy set a trial date for November 3 at Sefton Magistrates\u2019 Court. This week, it emerged that Liverpool FC are in discussion with supporters group Spion Kop to discuss potential improvements to the match day process for flagbearers. theliverpoolecho Related : Courts, Steven Gerrard, Liverpool FC, Sefton, Anfield, Get Liverpool FC news by email Invalid e-mail Subscribe Thanks for subscribing!
