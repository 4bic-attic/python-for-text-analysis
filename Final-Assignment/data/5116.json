First up \u2013 the Tracy Dot Print Cross Back Knit Top.\u00a0 That\u2019s a mouth full of a description.\u00a0 I thought the dots were cute and the crisscross in the back (which you can\u2019t see \u2013 sorry) gave this top a little something extra. Next \u2013 the Kathy Striped Fit and Flare Dress.\u00a0 This was super flattering.\u00a0 It made my waist really tiny \u2013 after 2 babies (including one 10 pounder), anything that makes my waist look tiny is a keeper!\u00a0 I think this would be really cute with a jean jacket for fall.\u00a0 I think I got rid of my jean jackets so hoping to find a cute cardigan to pair with it.\u00a0 I need to experiment. I then tried on the Fetra Scoop Neck Blouse and Dayna Skinny Jean.\u00a0 First of all the blouse is a Daniel Rainn blouse and anything from Daniel Rainn is an automatic keeper for me.\u00a0 I LOVED it.\u00a0 And the jeans were so fun.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any colored jeans.\u00a0 These fit like a glove and were super soft.\u00a0 Also, I thought I could get away with wearing them to work because they didn\u2019t scream denim.\u00a0 Love and love.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually wearing this outfit today. Finally, the Amari Jacket.\u00a0 This was a tad big on me, but I thought it was really cute and the striped sleeves added something unique.\u00a0 I\u2019m wearing it with the red jeans in the picture and I think it would look much better with dark denim, but you get the idea. So when I was done trying everything on, I asked my mom and A what they thought I should keep.\u00a0 It was unanimous \u2013 EVERYTHING.\u00a0 The awesome perk with Stitch Fix is that if you keep everything, you get 25% off.\u00a0 So I kept it all and I\u2019ve already worn three of the five items.\u00a0 Super impressed with this Stitch Fix!!
