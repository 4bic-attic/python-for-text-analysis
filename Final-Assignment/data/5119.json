His fight against the US government and studio bosses over freedom of speech is documented in the movie and Bryan found reliving history an eye-opener.\n\n\"Trumbo was a great guy to get involved in. Troubled, confusing, complex... just an interesting guy to get in his skin,\" he told ET Canada.\n\nThe film also stars Elle Fanning, Dame Helen Mirren and Diane Lane as Trumbo's wife Cleo, who passed away aged 93 in 2009. It's already garnered Oscar buzz after having its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival recently, apparently receiving a five-minute standing ovation.\n\nSince finding fame on the small screen, Bryan's star has quickly risen, with roles in big flicks such as Drive, Argo and the remake of Godzilla. But for the 59-year-old, playing dad Hal in TV show Malcolm in the Middle will always hold a special place in his heart.\n\n\"Right now, I think, I look back on Malcolm in the Middle. It's been ten years since we went off the air, and it'd be fun to pick up that guy's clothes again and be fun and sweet and adorable and hapless and clueless and afraid of everything,\" he smiled.\n\nHowever, those longing for him to return to the role of chemistry-teacher-turned-meth-cook Walter White in award-winning series Breaking Bad are setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\n\"I don't have a yearning to go back into [Walter's] world because we just covered it completely I think,\" he added.
