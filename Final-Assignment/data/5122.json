It is thought he has fled to NSW after swapping some property for cash. \n\nAs the crime is not an extraditable offence police now have to wait until Scott returns to WA. \n\nThrough tears and broken English building owners Adonna and Frank De Angelis said they had no idea how to move forward. \n\nThe couple were devastated to see their hard work laying in ruin. \n\n\u201cLook what they have done to this place,\u201d Mrs De Angelis said. \n\n\u201cWe worked hard to build this place, often working until the early hours of the morning. \n\n\u201cNow someone has destroyed it in a matter of weeks.\u201d \n\nTwo weeks after the police raid, the remnants of the set-up still remain. \n\nHose, aluminium, plant feed and empty pots litter the places where bookshelves should have been. \n\nThe De Angelis family came to Collie 54 years ago and owned the Forrest Street block for 30 years. \n\n\u201cThe animals involved need to be locked up,\u201d Mr De Angelis said. \n\n\u201cThey have lied and destroyed our little place.\u201d \n\nWhat happens next is unclear as the couple try to sort out insurance and the hefty utility bills left behind. \n\n\u201cCollie people have given us a beautiful life,\u201d Mr De Angelis said. \n\n\u201cBut we have never seen anything like this before. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do.\u201d The story first appeared on Collie Mail.", "source": "Esperance Express"}
