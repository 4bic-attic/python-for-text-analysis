He beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the Montreal final to break an eight-match losing streak to the Serb star over the past two years. \u201cI feel confident,\u201d Murray said. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m hitting the ball well. I\u2019ve played as lot of matches so my body is match tight, which is good, and I\u2019ve also played a couple long matches the last few weeks, which is physcially good preparation for here.\u201d \n \nMurray, who has a high-profile opener Tuesday against Nick Kyrgios after the Australian bad-boy was sanctioned for comments in a match at Montreal to rival Stan Wawrinka, is being guided by Swede Jonas Bjorkman while France\u2019s Mauresmo is recovering after giving birth. \u201cAmelie will probably be back, hopefully at Paris at the end of the year,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really discussed anything yet. It\u2019s just kind of wait and see whether she wants to continue. Things obviously changed for her and it\u2019s really her decision. We\u2019ll sit down and chat in a month or so and see where we are at.\u201d \n \n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her for the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve messaged. When I started working with Amelie we planned on it being a long-term thing and obviously I thought around the majors is where she could help the most, but life is a lot more important than tennis.", "source": "Asian Age"}
