It\u2019s more of a guiding set of ideas rather than a list of details, but factors such as investment, tax and accreditation will be included,\u201d he told reporters at his office on Friday. \n\nRudiantara argued that shoring up a solid roadmap was crucial to unleashing the potential of the rapidly growing sector \n\nIndonesian e-commerce transactions reached US$12 billion at the end of 2014, a significant surge from the $8 billion listed in 2013. Some venture capitalists have said that e-commerce start-ups top their list of desired investments for this year. The Indonesian E-Commerce Association (idEA) expects the market to be worth Rp 295 trillion ($24.6 billion) by 2016. \n\nThe government planned to unveil the roadmap last month, but the plan seemed to be hampered by complexity arising from discussions regarding taxation and funding issues. The roadmap involves eight ministries, namely the Ministry of Communication and Information, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, the Investment Coordinating Board and the Creative Economy Agency. \n\nRudiantara was reported by local media as saying that imposing a tax of 10 percent on e-commerce transactions would be too burdensome for e-commerce startups. He also admitted that regulating taxes on e-commerce would be more complicated than regulating offline businesses. \n\nReferring to the funding issue, Rudiantara said that e-commerce should be taken off the country\u2019s negative investment list in order to provide wider funding sources for start-ups willing to expand their businesses. \n\nAccording to Rudiantara, foreign investment in e-commerce was still necessary amid the limited domestic investment available for the sector at the moment. \n\nUnder Presidential Decree No. 39/2014, the government included e-commerce among the industries closed to foreign investment, requiring e-commerce businesses to be wholly owned by local players. \n\nRudiantara argued that Indonesian e-commerce currently lacked sufficient infrastructure for online transactions. \n\n\u201cAround 70 percent of online payments are made through ATMs and then the parties show the receipts to each other through instant messaging. With this roadmap, we can figure out how to develop the infrastructure to help that become easier,\u201d the minister said on Friday. \n\nRudiantara added that his ministry also planned to establish an accreditation institution to help set benchmarks for local e-commerce startups. \n\nSeparately, Alexander Rusli, the CEO of publicly listed telecommunications firm Indosat, said that he was optimistic about the sustainable development of e-commerce in Indonesia. \n\n\u201cThe journey toward a solid national e-commerce platform is a long one. Even Silicon Valley took years and years from the 1960s to become what it is today. It\u2019s a complex road filled with multiple setbacks, but with the burgeoning rise in e-commerce startups in Indonesia, I think we are ready to take that journey,\u201d Alexander said. \n\n------------------------- \n\nTo receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft's Windows Store.
