Photo: Supplied  \n  \nThe battle for\u00a0market share between Woolworths, Coles and independent supermarkets has been a boon for family-owned shopping\u00a0trolley supplier QHDC Australia. \n\nSupermarkets are spending\u00a0millions of dollars a\u00a0year\u00a0upgrading their 1.5 million fleet of shopping trolleys to cater for changing\u00a0grocery shopping habits and\u00a0to\u00a0avoid\u00a0\"trolley rage\" triggered by wobbly wheels and misshapen\u00a0baskets. \n\n\"I don't think\u00a0the supermarket\u00a0chains saw the trolley as important \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0wasn't the top priority when capex had to be spent,\" said QHDC Australia director\u00a0and\u00a0co-owner Wayne Sully. \n\n\"Now they\u00a0recognise the fact that it's the first thing the customer touches when they go into a supermarket,\" he said. \n \nThe major supermarket chains and independent retailers are now upgrading trolleys\u00a0every three or four years instead of every five to seven years,\u00a0reducing the number 212-litre\u00a0trolleys and adding more 70- and 100-litre\u00a0models to cater to\u00a0more frequent\u00a0shopping trips,\u00a0the growing popularity of self-scanning checkouts and an ageing population. \n\nThe big weekly\u00a0food and grocery shop is becoming a\u00a0thing of the past \u2013\u00a0just\u00a034 per cent\u00a0of the average shopper's weekly food budget\u00a0is\u00a0spent on a\u00a0primary\u00a0shopping\u00a0day \u2013\u00a0and most consumers are shopping two to three times a week for fresh food. \n\n\"There are\u00a0more\u00a0of the shallow trolleys around now\u00a0because people are doing smaller and more frequent shops,\" a Coles spokesman said. \nBigger was better \nSmaller trolleys now account for between 40 and 50 per cent of the fleet\u00a0at major\u00a0chains such as Woolworths\u00a0and Coles, compared with just 20 per cent\u00a0previously. The average store has 300 to 400 trolleys. \n\n\"Five or six years ago bigger was\u00a0better \u2013\u00a0the chains went to 240 litre trolleys because they had feedback from the\u00a0market\u00a0the bigger the trolley the more groceries\u00a0people put in,\" Mr Sully said. \n\n\"But the trend in Australia at the moment is that people are\u00a0shopping once or twice\u00a0a week, they're\u00a0using a smaller trolley, and the major supermarket chains\u00a0are now recognising that fact,\" he said. \n\nThe Sullys \u2013\u00a0directors\u00a0Wayne and David and their sister\u00a0Carol\u00a0Schulze \u2013\u00a0were running the family's\u00a0powder-coating business at Burleigh Heads\u00a0about 18 years ago\u00a0when one\u00a0of the major supermarket chains asked them to recoat its fleet of 165-litre trolleys. \n\nFive years later, when\u00a0the retailer decided to upgrade its fleet to 212\u00a0litres,\u00a0the Sullys were invited to tender for the job, even though they had no source of supply. \n\n\"There was\u00a0no manufacturer in Australia and the cost\u00a0of setting up in Australia was far too prohibitive, so we had to go offshore,\" Mr Sully recalled. \n\nAfter sourcing trolleys from a\u00a0major supplier in Guangzhou\u00a0for many years, QHDC established its own manufacturing facility in Suzhou, west of Shanghai,\u00a0in August last year. \n\nThe company, Suzhou\u00a0QHDC Metal Products, now\u00a0produces between\u00a0120,000 and 150,000 trolleys a year, supplying the major grocery and discount\u00a0department store chains and\u00a0independent retailers\u00a0in Australia, as well as other local suppliers and\u00a0retailers in the United States, Thailand, and Malaysia. \n\nSuzhou\u00a0QHDC\u00a0is also working with retailers to improve\u00a0shopping trolley design, improving the shape of baskets and handles and adding features such as\u00a0coffee cup holders, branding, twin seats and specialised seats for parents with disabled children. \n\n\"We have\u00a0some new concepts we are\u00a0working\u00a0on\u00a0with\u00a0customers \u2013\u00a0they'll be easier\u00a0to push and more friendly to the eye,\" said\u00a0Mr Sully.", "source": "Brisbane Times"}
