Life is short and if you want to make a difference in life you got to do it then and now. Even the little smallest things can make a difference.\"\n\nMorrison said she feels blessed to have members in her community with that attitude. \"I feel like that's a blessing. For them to come out and help me, that shows that people have love for you and care,\" said Morrison.\n\nThat's the goal. Spreading paint on the house, and kindness in the community. Through Saturday, volunteers will work on three more homes in the city.", "source": "WFXG FOX 54"}
