Sheri has the blog: When the Kids Go to Bed . \n \nBetween soccer, fall ball, tutoring, swim practice and everything else, evenings can be pretty hectic, right? Planning is definitely key to balancing everything, but sometimes we just forget to plan. I know I can\u2019t be the only one. This weeknight dinner was concocted on one such evening where I just threw what I had into a saut\u00e9 pan and hoped for the best. Well, it was delicious and done in 20 minutes. \n \n\n \nIngredients: \n \n2 tbsp olive oil \n1lb Sweet Italian turkey sausage (removed from casing) \n\u00bd a yellow onion (diced) \n1 package of fresh baby kale (roughly 4 large handfuls) \n\u00bd lb cooked pasta of your choice \n1 tbsp butter \nSalt & pepper \n \nFirst, get that water going for your pasta. \n \nNow heat up the olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan. Toss in your onion and sausage. Check your pasta water, it should be about done. Get your pasta cooking! \n \nOnce the sausage is browned, the onions are translucent, and your pasta is near done, toss in the kale and add some salt and pepper. Cover and turn down the heat. \n \nAdd the cooked pasta and tablespoon of butter to the sausage and kale, toss and serve. So delicious and filling! Hope you enjoy! \n \nABOUT SHERI MCSHANE: \n \n Hello All. My name is Sheri. I am a working mother of 3 pretty darn fabulous little boys.
