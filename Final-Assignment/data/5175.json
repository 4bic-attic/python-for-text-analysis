It is extremely troubling that there are another 500,000 veterans who have also applied for their health care benefits and are languishing in a bureaucratic black hole awaiting their care. \n \n\u201cVA Secretary Bob McDonald was brought on board over a year ago to fix these problems. Despite Congress providing tens of billions of dollars to the VA in additional funding for more employees and information systems, it is clear that he has not done so. \n \n\u201cIt is astounding that the VA IG\u2019s report substantiated such horrific mismanagement at the VA on the determination of eligibility for benefits at a time when the VA recently claimed historic progress on its disability backlog. It is more disappointing that the IG only investigated this allegation at the direction of Congress. I commend House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller for demanding answers to this problem at the VA. \n \n\u201cIt is absolutely clear that the way ahead for reform of the VA must be to empower all veterans to immediately get the care they need where and when they need it \u2013 regardless of the location \u2013 and never allow bureaucrats to deny our nation\u2019s heroes the benefits they deserve.\u201d \n###", "source": "U.S. Senator John McCain"}
