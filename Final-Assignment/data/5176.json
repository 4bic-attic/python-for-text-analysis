Well, one company is taking a crack at making the art of keeping track of it all a whole lot easier. \n \nThe folks at Wilson have introduced a smart basketball, one that has the ability to connect with an app on your cell phone that will automatically calculate your shooting percentage. You don't have to attach anything to the rim, there is nothing external to deal with, and the technology of it all seems pretty impressive. \n \nInitial testing showed that the accuracy level was strong, but wasn't quite perfect just yet. Still, you can see the direction that all of this is going, and this doesn't appear to be bad at all for a first generation attempt. \n \n(h/t: The Verge )", "source": "FOXNews.com"}
