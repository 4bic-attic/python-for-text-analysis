Analysts estimated $15.6 billion. \n \nDollar Tree is\u00a0working to absorb the Family Dollar chain of stores, which it acquired in a $9.07 billion deal in July. The takeover created a a more formidable competitor to Dollar General Inc., the largest US dollar-store chain by revenue. \n \nDollar Tree declined to give a profit forecast in the statement, citing the integration and plans to divest some Family Dollar stores to satisfy antitrust regulators\u2019 concerns. \n \nThe shares slid as low as $71.16 before the start of regular trading in New York.
