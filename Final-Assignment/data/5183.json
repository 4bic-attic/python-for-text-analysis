The sea freight container has left, our air freight will leave next week. \n \n\u201cWe will be in Singapore,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cAs far as the rest of the races this season, we have a budget in place and we will operate to that budget and will be at all the races.\u201d \n \nDeputy boss Federico Gastaldi, meanwhile, told Speed Week he is confident good news about the Renault talks will soon be forthcoming. \n \n\u201cThis is no official statement,\u201d he said, \u201cbut my own gut feeling is that the parties could and should be able to announce something (soon). \n \n\u201cIf Renault has made the decision, then the official confirmation should not be long in the coming.  We need to work as quickly as possible on the new car,\u201d added Gastaldi.", "source": "Inautonews"}
