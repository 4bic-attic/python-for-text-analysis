We have been able to help some really good organisations who are doing some really good work.\n\n\u201cIt is always nice to see people from these organisations collecting their awards and enjoying good food and drink.\u201d\n\nThe grants given out ranged from \u00a3300 to \u00a31,500 with organisations pledging to spend the cash on anything from play equipment to chair trolleys for a village hall.\n\nOne of the largest awards went to Chichester Down Syndrome Support Group, which will be spending the money on speech therapy for some of the young people it supports.\n\nPresent on the night were Nick and Kath Lake, parents of a child with Down\u2019s Syndrome, one of 60 families across the Chichester, Bognor Regis and Midhurst areas to be supported by the group.\n\nMrs Lake said: \u201cWe are delighted to get such a big award as it will make a real difference for our children.\u201d\n\nSafe in Sussex, which runs two refuges in the Worthing area for victims of domestic violence and their children, was handed \u00a31,000 which will spent to buy new playroom equipment.\n\nJanet St Pierre, who collected the award with fellow child support worker Tara Gambling, said children were sometimes the forgotten victims of domestic abuse.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe women get an awful lot of support but sometimes the children just have to get on with it. They have been affected by it and what they have seen and have had to move from outside the area. They have been taken from friends, families and schools.\n\n\u201cWe give them one to one support.\n\n\u201cWe told the children where we coming tonight and and said we might get some money and we asked them what they would like to spend the money on.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the newest organisation to receive an award was Oaktree Farm Care in Copsale near Horsham, which received \u00a3500 just one month after being granted charitable status.\n\nAmanda and Andrew Churcher set it up as a social enterprise after being frustrated by the lack of support for young adults with special learning needs. Their centre in the middle of the West Sussex countryside allows those they support to learn new skills.\n\nAn emotional Mrs Churcher revealed it was the first grant they had received.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are so pleased, we just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nGary Shipton, editor-in-chief of Sussex Newspapers, said: \u201cWe have always supported what Mark Woodhouse and his team do with the community chest as it is such a wonderful initiative.\n\n\u201cI have met so many people tonight who are genuinely touched by the awards they have received for their organisations. It is us who should be thanking them.\u201d\n\nClubs and organisations which received awards this year are:\n\n1st Langley Green Scout Group \u00a3750; \n\n5th/10th Horsham Scouts \u00a3300; \n\nAdur Special Needs Project \u00a3750; \n\nThe Arundel Players \u00a3600; \n\nThe Base Skatepark CIC \u00a31,000; \n\nBell Tower Drop In \u00a3800; \n\nBlueprint 22 \u00a31,500; \n\nBognor Regis District Scout Council \u00a3700; \n\nBognor Regis Stroke Support Group \u00a3500; \n\nCancer United \u00a3750; \n\nChichester Down Syndrome Support Group \u00a31,500; \n\nChichester Stroke Club \u00a3500; \n\nContact the Elderly \u00a3400; \n\nDavison Worthing Youth Concert Band \u00a3500; \n\nElectric Storm Youth Ltd \u00a3400; \n\nEpilepsy Lifestyle \u00a3700; \n\nFriends of Wrenford \u00a3300; \n\nHorsham & District and Billingshurst Bar Billiards Leagues \u00a3500; \n\nChichester Information Shop for Young People \u00a3300; \n\nNASS Bognor Branch \u00a3500; \n\nOaktree Farm Care \u00a3500; \n\nThe Point, Scope West Sussex \u00a31,500; \n\nRedford Village Hall \u00a31,000; \n\nRipe and Chalvington Village Hall \u00a3500; \n\nRudgwick Friendly Club \u00a3400; \n\nSafe in Sussex \u00a31,000; \n\nSouthwater Village Hall \u00a3300; \n\nStorrington Area Help Scheme \u00a3500; \n\nSasbah \u00a31,000; \n\nYapton & Ford Village Hall \u00a3500; \n\nYoung At Heart Over 60s Club \u00a3500; \n\nYouth of Bognor \u00a3500\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.\n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on.\n\n1) Make our website your homepage \n\n2) Like our Facebook page \n\n3) Follow us on Twitter\n\n4) Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).
