He is a good player and works very hard. I hope to see our partnership helping the team in the tournament,\u201d Postiga said. \n\nPostiga said he was eager to emulate the deeds of Spanish World Cupper Luis Garcia, whose exploits last season earned him the award \u2018Most Exciting Player\u2019 of the tournament. Garcia, then aged 36, encountered some injury problems and missed a few matches which apparently prompted the defending champion ATK seek a younger marquee player. \n\nPostiga, who played for a prominent Spanish La Liga club Deportivo La Coruna in the previous season, said he felt fit and enjoyed the month-long pre-season training in the high altitude venue in Segovia in Spain. \n\n\u201c(Luis) Garcia had good season and helped the team to the championship last year. I look forward to do something better,\u201d Postiga said as the team prepared to start its training at the Mohun Bagan ground on Friday. \n\n\u201cI find my Indian colleagues quite good. I was surprised at the way they performed and the hard work they put in during the pre-season training,\u201d Postiga said. \n\nAttacking football \n\nHead coach Antonio Habas was categorical about his approach as the defending champion and said his team would play attacking football. \u201cWe will take each match at a time and progress accordingly. My immediate plan is to play against Chennaiyin FC (on October 3 in Chennai) where we look to start with a win,\u201d Habas said. \n\n\u201cMy team has shaped up well in the pre-season training where I found the Indian players showing fantastic attitude and fitness. This is a very good combination and I hope it will be carried well into the tournament,\u201d Habas said. \n\nKeywords: Indian Super League 2015, ISL 2015, Postiga, Atletico de Kolkata", "source": "The Hindu"}
