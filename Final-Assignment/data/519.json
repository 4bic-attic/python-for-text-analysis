F*** this.' \n\nThe stranger then responds: 'Wrong number but hell yeah. Paint that girl's room blue.' \n  \nThe recipient was happy to offer advice on decorating and encouraged the dad to paint the room blue \n\nAfter apologising to the recipient the dad then takes the opportunity to ask the benevolent stranger for some interior decorating tips. 'Hey can I ask a real quick? You think turquoise or that periwinkle for a 3yr old?' \n\nThey respond: 'I think more a toned down turquoise. Not too loud, because bedrooms are supposed to be chill, you know?' \n\nThe father then goes as far to send the receiver a colour swatch asking their opinion on the shade of blue.\u00a0 \n\nThey remark: 'That's pretty. It could be a little dark though, depending on the size of room and furniture.' \n\nTo which he responds: 'Room's okay size. There's a big window on one wall and just got her some white furniture. The kind that looks woven together.' \n   \nThe father seemed extremely grateful for the stranger's interior decorating advice\u00a0 \n\nThis is a red flag to the interiors-minded stranger who asks, 'wicker?' \n\nThe dad replies that it is and it's going to get dusty, but his anonymous correspondent replies, 'Probably but it's cute.'\u00a0 \n\nThe stranger suggests a certain colour way: 'I'd do the colour you picked on the wall across from the window and maybe a lighter colour on the other three walls?' \n\nThe father agrees with the suggestion adding: 'My baby girl's gonna have her blue room and it's gonna look tight as hell.\u00a0 \n\n'Yo thanks for your help. Sorry for keeping you up.' \n\nThe stranger finishes the conversation: 'No problem! I hope everything goes well. Night!' \n\nThe amusing exchange has since been shared across several social media platforms including Twitter and", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
