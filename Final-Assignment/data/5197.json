Both the extremists of Islamic State and militants of Yemen\u2019s Al Qaeda affiliate have sought to consolidate their strength as fighting between Houthis and pro-government forces has raged across the country. Officials called urgently for blood donations, as hospitals are desperately short of blood as well as vital medical supplies. A witness who was close by when the twin explosions occurred described a nightmarish episode, with injured and bloodied worshipers staggering out of the ruins of the mosque only to be caught up in the second blast.\n\u201cWhen the first explosion happened, people and ambulances rushed to the area,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd moments later we heard another explosion.\u201d At least two ambulances were destroyed by the car bomb, he said.\nEarlier Wednesday, several civilians were killed and injured in airstrikes not far from the site of the mosque bombing, apparently aimed at Houthi targets in the capital, including an air base, officials and witnesses said. Human rights groups have repeatedly denounced combatants for indiscriminate attacks in densely populated civilian areas.\nHeavy fighting also continued in the crossroads city of Taizz, south of the capital, while in the southern port city of Aden \u2013 seized by pro-government forces this summer \u2013 a military officer was assassinated, the fourth such killing in three days. The coalition led by Sunni Muslim-dominated Saudi Arabia is trying to restore exiled President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to power and shatter the Houthi rebel movement, which it considers a proxy of Shiite Iran. Hadi fled Yemen nearly six months ago as rebels closed in on Aden, where he had taken refuge after Sana fell to the Houthis.\nSpecial correspondent Al-Alayaa reported from Sana and Times staff writer King from Cairo.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times", "source": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times"}
