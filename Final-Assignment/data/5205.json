The Indians did that without a 100-yard rusher sharing the load between 12 rushers and backup quarterback Brian Schoenborn joined Pavek with a touchdown pass at the quarterback position. \n\nSchoenborn hit Lefebcvre on a 33-yard touchdown pass nine seconds into the second quarter. Lebebvre scored three times in the game when he scampered in from the 10 at 6:31 for a 33-0 lead. \n\n\u201cIt has to be tough on opposing defenses to try and stop us right now,\u201d said Clark. \n\nJake Worms scored on a 48-yard run for the final touchdown of the first half and found the end zone again early in the third quarter from 26 yards and a 46-0 lead. \n\nJon Starkey rushed 26 yards for Mahnomen\u2019s final score and 52-0 lead with three minutes remaining. \n\nThe Rebels negated a shutout on special teams when Charlie Coleman returned the ensuing kickoff 79 yards for the 52-6 final. \n\n\u201cDefensively, we were very good again,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI really like how our kids are starting to make adjustments as the game goes along.\u00a0We gave up some yardage in the first half, but our first group really shut them down in the second half.\u00a0 Again, we have several kids making plays on defense.\u00a0Nick Podlak, among others, had a tremendous game from his nose guard position.\u00a0He seemed to be in the backfield and around the ball all night.\u00a0This was a good test for our defense and they did a great job of playing team defense all night.\u00a0The young guys continue to get a lot of playing time and are showing big improvements as well.\u201d \n\nThose backup players will likely get plenty of more playing time as Mahnomen\u2019s next two opponents have combined for one victory. Badger/Greenbush-Middle River is 0-5 and New York Mills is 1-4. The Indians may get a game where their starting players can get a full four quarters of play in the season finale at Polk County West. The Thunder currently has a record of 5-0. \n\nIndians results \n\nMahnomen at Red Lake County Central, Friday, Sept. 18 \n\nMAH\u00a0 20 19 7 6 \u2014 52 \n\nRLC \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0 0 0 0 \u2014 \u00a06 \n\nScoring: \n\n1st quarter \n\nMAH \u2013 Pavek 23 run; Schoenborn kick \n\nMAH \u2013 Lefebvre 50 pass from Pavek; Schoenborn kick \n\nMAH \u2013 Foss 6 run; kick blocked \n\n2nd quarter \n\nMAH \u2013 Lefebvre 33 pass from Schoenborn; Schoenborn kick \n\nMAH \u2013 Lefebvre 10 run, kick failed \n\nMAH \u2013 Worms 48 run, PAT failed \n\n3rd quarter \n\nMAH \u2013 Worms 26 run, Schoenborn kick \n\n4th quarter \n\nMAH \u2013 Starkey 34 run, kick failed \n\nRLC \u2013 Coleman 79 kick return, PAT failed", "source": "DL-Online"}
