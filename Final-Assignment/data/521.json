Allegedly Zolciak did not know she was going to be cut from the show before her fate was revealed on live TV last night, but she was told to get on her Skype and update fans on her health status ( a blood clot led to her stroke). Kim really wanted to stay on the show, but according to the rules, if a celeb must miss a performance they must withdraw from the competition. She has not been cleared to fly yet, but she was practicing with her partner Tony Dovolani over the weekend.\u00a0\u201cI think the producers were fighting until the last minute to keep us in the competition,\u201d Dovolani told Us Magazine, adding the lawyers made the final decision. \u201cI want to continue so bad it\u2019s not even funny. That\u2019s why I put a tweet out there saying, \u2018Bring us back!\u2019 The producers want us back, I want to be back, Kim wants to be back \u2014 so the only people they needed to convince was the lawyers,\u201d he said.
