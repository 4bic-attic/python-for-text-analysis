In this post, TPG Senior Points & Miles Correspondent Jason Steele explains how to use your Alaska Airlines\u00a0Mileage Plan miles to book the flights you want. \n \nDon\u2019t let the name fool you \u2014 Alaska Airlines is no longer a small regional carrier focused on our 49th state. It\u2019s now a major domestic airline\u00a0for flights to and from the Pacific Northwest, and its importance is bolstered by numerous partnerships with larger international carriers. \n \nIn this post, I\u2019ll\u00a0explore how you can book award flights with Alaska\u2019s Mileage Plan frequent flyer program, continuing\u00a0my series on award flight booking from previous\u00a0guides for Delta , American , and United . \n Alaska\u2019s route network is pretty big, and these are just the nonstop flights from its Seattle hub.  \nEarning Miles with Alaska Mileage Plan \n \nOne of the strengths of Alaska\u2019s Mileage Plan is\u00a0that miles\u00a0aren\u2019t difficult to\u00a0acquire. First, you can\u00a0earn Mileage Plan\u00a0miles from\u00a0paid flights on Alaska and its many\u00a0partners. Unlike Delta and United, Alaska Airlines passengers still earn miles based on\u00a0100% of the actual miles flown, plus the following bonuses for elite status and higher fare classes: \n  M and B classes of service earn a 25% bonus.  Y and S classes of service earn a 50% bonus.  Mileage Plan MVP members earn a 50% elite bonus.  Mileage Plan MVP Gold members earn a 100% elite bonus.  Mileage Plan MVP Gold 75K members earn a 125% elite bonus.   \nTo earn the most miles, you can also take advantage of the program\u2019s\u00a0 many bonus mileage offers , like double miles for flights between Seattle and New York-JFK , as well as\u00a0between Los Angeles and Baltimore . Note that\u00a0you must typically register for these promotions in advance of any qualifying\u00a0flights. \n Alaska offers many routes with double miles promotions, but you have to remember to register first.  \nAlthough Alaska isn\u2019t part of a\u00a0major global airline alliance, it\u00a0does have 15 different airline partners you can earn miles on, depending on the fare class purchased: \n  AeroMexico  Air France  American (and US Airways starting October 18)  British Airways  Cathay Pacific  Delta  Emirates  Fiji Airways  Hainan Airlines  KLM  Korean Air  LAN  Qantas  PenAir  Ravn Alaska   \nIn addition, Alaska is known for frequently offering miles for sale at a discount. Currently, you can get\u00a0 up to a 40% bonus when you buy Mileage Plan miles \u00a0through October 6, 2015. If you maximize the promotion, you\u2019d end up paying\u00a0$1,182.50 for 56,000 miles, or approximately 2.1 cents per mile. Although this is just slightly more\u00a0than TPG\u2019s latest valuation \u00a0of 2.0 cents per mile, it\u2019s a quick and easy way to earn miles that\u00a0can easily be worth far more than two cents when you redeem for premium international partner awards. \n \nNote that payment for mileage purchases is made to\u00a0Points.com, so it\u00a0won\u2019t be\u00a0recognized as an airline purchase. That means\u00a0you won\u2019t\u00a0earn extra\u00a0miles for this purchase by using a co-branded Alaska Airlines card\u00a0(or another credit card that earns bonus rewards\u00a0for airfare or travel ). \n \nFinally, Alaska offer numerous rental car , hotel \u00a0and shopping partners that can help\u00a0you can earn miles. \n The\u00a0Alaska Airlines Visa Signature Card offers a lucrative\u00a0companion ticket.  \nCredit Cards, Transfers and Other Partners \n \nAlaska Airlines\u00a0is a transfer partner of the Starwood Preferred Guest program . If you signed up for the Starwood Preferred Guest credit card from American Express \u2014 with its current sign-up bonus of 30,000 points \u00a0when you spend $3,000 within three months of account opening \u2014 you could have a total of 38,000 Mileage Plan\u00a0miles after you meet the minimum spending requirement and earn\u00a0the 5,000-mile bonus for transferring 20,000 Starpoints. \n \nAlaska offers its own co-branded credit cards from Bank of America, including the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature Card , which\u00a0currently offers a sign-up bonus of 25,000 miles upon approval. You also get\u00a0perks like\u00a0a free checked bag, a $99 coach companion pass \u00a0and 3 miles per dollar spent\u00a0on Alaska Airlines purchases. There is a $75 annual fee for this card that\u2019s not waived for the first year. \n Emirates is just one of Alaska\u2019s valuable partner airlines.  \nAward Charts and Sweet Spots \n \nRather than offering a single award chart, Alaska publishes multiple charts\u00a0depending on the region you\u2019re traveling to and the airline partner you\u2019re flying with. Here are links to all the charts: \n  Continental US and Canada  Intra-State  Hawaii  Africa, Middle East, India  Asia  Australia, New Zealand, South Pacific  Central and South America  Caribbean  Mexico  Europe   \nTo determine how many\u00a0miles are required for a particular flight, you select the mileage chart for the region you\u2019re traveling to, and then select from the appropriate partner. \n \nHere are some of the top redemption opportunities in the Mileage Plan program: \n \nCathay Pacific is renowned for having one of the best first-class products\u00a0in the world , and you can use Alaska miles for flights to Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East for just 70,000 miles each way, with\u00a0Australia and New Zealand costing 80,000 miles each\u00a0way. If you can find award space (and don\u2019t mind the extra travel time), you can\u00a0stop in Cathay Pacific\u2019s Hong Kong hub before continuing on to destinations in Asia and Africa for no additional miles.\u00a0Even its business-class awards are\u00a0a good value, at 50,000 miles to Asia, 62,500 miles to Africa, India and the Middle East, and 60,000 miles to\u00a0Australia and New Zealand. \n \nEmirates \u00a0funnels enough traffic\u00a0through Alaska\u2019s\u00a0Seattle hub that it was able to justify\u00a0 adding a second daily flight to and from Dubai . As with\u00a0Cathay Pacific, using Alaska miles for premium flights on Emirates can be a fantastic deal. First-class awards to India and the Middle East are 90,000 miles each way, with business-class awards at 72,500 miles. You can reach Asian and European destinations for 100,000 miles in first and 75,000 miles in business, while\u00a0Africa is 100,000 miles in first and 77,500 in business. Once again,\u00a0you can\u00a0add flights to further destinations for little or no additional cost. \n Qantas offers another good redemption option for Alaska miles, even if first-class awards are nearly impossible to find.  \nQantas first-class awards would also be a great deal at 70,000 miles each way if they were ever released. You might find business-class award seats , which are also quite reasonable at 55,000 miles each way. Fiji Airways is another option for award flights to\u00a0Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific, with\u00a0business-class awards for 55,000 miles each way. \n \nLAN (soon to be rebranded LATAM) is a partner that lets you fly to South America in business class for 45,000 miles each way. LAN has a newly refurbished business class featured on its\u00a0787 fleet . \n \nAmerican Airlines  off-peak awards can be booked through Mileage Plan, with economy flights to\u00a0Europe for\u00a020,000 miles each way from October 15 to\u00a0May 15, and economy flights to South America from 15,000 \u2013 20,000 miles (depending on the destination) during various off-peak dates. Flights to Japan and Korea are 25,000 miles each way in coach from October 1 to April 30. \n \nFinally, you can get good value when you use\u00a0Mileage Plan miles to fly on Alaska Airlines itself. Deals include flights within Alaska (the largest state in the US), which start at just 7,500 miles each way. Alaska also offers extensive service to Hawaii starting at 20,000 miles each way. While that\u2019s not a spectacular deal, it\u2019s\u00a0reasonable considering how much service Alaska offers to Hawaii from its West Coast hubs. \n \nFor more\u00a0ideas on how to maximize Mileage Plan miles, check out\u00a0Nick Ewen\u2019s post on\u00a0 7 Great Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan Award Redemptions . \n Alaska\u2019s favorable routing rules\u00a0allow\u00a0stopovers and open jaws.  \nBooking Process \n \nAlaska has\u00a0a very good award search engine, which includes nearly all partners except Cathay Pacific and LAN. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll have to call to book awards on\u00a0those two partners. \n \nWhen putting together an award itinerary, consider Alaska\u2019s quirky routing rules. You\u2019re not allowed\u00a0to put together\u00a0an award flight that uses\u00a0multiple partners; however, you can use flights on Alaska to reach a domestic gateway, and then continue on with a single partner. \n \nAlaska is also unique in that it always allows a free stopover (a change of planes greater than 24 hours) in each direction, even on one-way awards. So you can use these miles to visit as many as three different destinations on a round-trip flight. You\u2019re also allowed to include a double open jaw, which gives you even more opportunities to travel flexibly.\u00a0For more comprehensive information, check out\u00a0TPG Special Contributor Eric Rosen\u2019s\u00a0 Overview of Alaska Airlines Award Routing Rules \n \nOther Tips \n \nAlaska won\u2019t\u00a0impose fuel surcharges on its awards with the exception of\u00a0those on\u00a0British Airways, which are in line with what American and other carriers charge. Unfortunately, Alaska\u00a0does charge a handful of other fees that you should be prepared for, including a \u201cPartner Award Booking Fee\u201d\u00a0of $12.50 each way for partner awards, and a $15 per ticket \u201ccall center ticketing fee.\u201d If you have to cancel or change a reservation \u00a0within 60 days of your flight, be ready for the steep\u00a0$125 fee, which is waived for Mileage Plan MVP Gold or 75k members. \n \nFor ticketing a lap child on an award reservation, Alaska charges the customary 10% of the paid fare, but that might be the least of your problems. One TPG reader had to spend about a dozen hours on the phone with Alaska and British Airways before he\u00a0could figure out a way to ticket his\u00a0infant for an upcoming award flight. Ultimately, he had to engage Alaska\u2019s Director of Customer Support to make it happen, so be prepared for a bit of an ordeal if you decide to travel with your little one. For more information about lap child ticketing, read my comprehensive guide on How to Plan Award Travel with an Infant or Lap Child . \n \nUse the British Airways website to\u00a0search for Cathay Pacific and LAN award space. Although Cathay doesn\u2019t release much first-class award space in advance, you can\u00a0often find seats within two weeks of departure. Cathay\u2019s\u00a0business-class award space is significantly more generous. \n \nBottom Line \n \nAlaska\u2019s Mileage Plan program offers a tremendous amount of value thanks to lucrative airline partners and flexible routing rules. It\u2019s no surprise that TPG has developed a crush on Alaska\u00a0Airlines , and that he\u00a0lists Alaska miles\u00a0near the top of his monthly valuations. \n \nIf you have\u00a0questions about how to book Mileage Plan awards, or want to share your own tips and strategies for maximizing Alaska miles, please post in the comments below! \n \nWhat\u2019s your favorite way to redeem Alaska miles?", "source": "The Points Guy"}
