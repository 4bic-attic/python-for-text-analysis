During this time, many refugees are in desperate need of a place to stay. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2013 Increasing efforts \u2013 \n \nThe JRS has already been working with refugees looking for a temporary home, and plans to expand its efforts. \n \nFive years ago the group launched a programme in the Paris area called \u201cWelcome\u201d, under which around a hundred families and religious communities house refugee families for five weeks. \n \nThe programme has been successful in helping migrants integrate and is now being rolled out to several other French cities, as well as to other countries, such as Spain. \n \nJRS says the five-week time limit is to encourage the refugees to be independent \u2014 without leaving any of the refugees on the street. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cAfter a while, you need the person to enter into the society\u201d of the host country, said Jean-Marie Carriere, regional director of the JRS. \n \nOther European communities have also already welcomed thousands of asylum seekers and are preparing for more. \n \nCardinal Angelo Bagnasco, chairman of the Italian bishops\u2019 conference, told the country\u2019s La Repubblica daily there was evidence \u201cof an important movement in all dioceses\u201d. \n \nItaly\u2019s Catholic organisations have already taken in between 15,000 and 20,000 asylum seekers. \n \nIn Austria too, dioceses have offered thousands of places for migrants to stay and several have announced plans to do more. \n \n \n \n \n \nPannonhalma Abbey in northwest Hungary, which is run by the Benedictine Order, has also opened its doors to Syrian families trekking across the country to western Europe, and said it is prepared to repeat the experience. \n \nCarlotta Sami, spokesperson in Italy for the UN refugee agency, said that the pope\u2019s calls to action supported the agency\u2019s goals. \n \n\u201cThe pope\u2019s voice has helped us for years to strongly support the welcome of those fleeing war and violence,\u201d she said. \n \n\u2013 Opportunity for interreligious dialogue \u2013 \n \nOne detail the pope didn\u2019t mention in his appeal is that the majority of the 336,000 migrants who arrived this year on Europe\u2019s shores are Muslim. \n \nFather Balleis saw it as a chance for foreign and local families to \u201cget to know and understand\u201d one another. \n \nThe Catholic Church isn\u2019t the only church appealing for greater solidarity. \n \nThe archbishop of the Finnish Lutheran Church, Kari M\u00e4kinen, called Saturday for the country\u2019s parishes to open up their centres for retreats and summer activities to refugees. \n \nThere has also been an outpouring of solidarity from groups with no religious affiliation, in Germany and elsewhere. \n \nIn France, the Singa foundation said it had received more than 1,000 offers of accommodation in just a few days, and in the UK more than 2,000 residents have said they are ready to welcome refugees as well. \n  Religion  Beliefs  Politics  Government  Catholic Church   \n\n \nArticle source: Article Source \n\nThe post appeared first on .", "source": "RocketNews"}
