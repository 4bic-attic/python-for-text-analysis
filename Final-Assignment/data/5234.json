Col. Yacouba Isaac Zida announced early Tuesday came as the National Armed Forces stepped up the pressure on the mutinous soldiers to stand down. \n\nOn Monday, the national army said it was sending soldiers from elsewhere around the country to Burkina Faso's capital in a show of force. The statement called on members of the presidential guard to lay down their weapons and return to their barracks. \n\nThe coup leader, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, later apologized to the nation through a communique and said he would hand over power to a civilian transitional government.", "source": "Miami Herald"}
