He was playing well before tearing his left ACL in December, ending his rookie season after 25 games. \n\nCoach Jason Kidd said at a team charity golf function on Tuesday that Parker looked good, but that the second-year forward wouldn't be rushed back. \n\nParker is a cornerstone on a team that made a surprise run to the playoffs last year.", "source": "Minneapolis Star Tribune"}
