If all goes according to the state\u2019s plan, Kelly Gissendaner will be the first woman the state has executed in 70 years. She was sentenced to death in 1998 for plotting the death of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with her boyfriend. \n \nGissendaner drove her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, to her house, gave him the murder weapons \u2014 a nightstick and a hunting knife \u2014 and then went to a nightclub with friends, according to court documents. Owen ambushed Douglas and forced him to drive his car to a remote location that Gissendaner chose beforehand. \n \nOnce they arrived, Owen beat Douglas and stabbed him. Owen took Douglas\u2019s wedding ring and watch to make it look like a robbery. Gissendaner later arrived at the scene and helped her boyfriend burn her husband\u2019s body and car. Law enforcement was unable to find Douglas\u2019s body for weeks. \n   \nOwen accepted a plea deal and testified against Gissendaner. In exchange, he received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Gissendaner refused to take a plea and lost when she went to trial. \n \nAs Gissendaner\u2019s execution date nears, two of her and Douglas\u2019s children are calling for her life to be spared. \n   \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our dad. We can\u2019t imagine losing our mom too,\u201d daughter Kayla Gissendaner said.  \n youtube.com \n   \nIn response, Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it was \u201cmanipulation.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe case began with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner and it appears it will end with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner,\u201d he said, adding that Douglas\u2019s parents have wanted the execution to go forward. \n \nOn Monday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it will meet on Tuesday to \u201creceive and consider supplemental information\u201d about the case. Previously, the board had denied clemency. The board has the option to allow the denial of clemency to stay, to grant a stay of up to 90 days, or to grant clemency. The board has the sole authority to grant clemency in Georgia. \n \nThis is the third time the state has set an execution date for Gissendaner. The first time, it was called off because of the weather. The second time, it was called off after the execution drugs were found to have particles floating in them. \n           \nView this image \u203a \n  \nGeorgia\u2019s pentobarbital on the date it was scheduled to be used.  Georgia Department of Corrections \n   \nGeorgia, like some other death penalty states, obtains its execution drugs from a compounding pharmacy that mixes the drug up in secret. \n \nThe state concluded that the likeliest cause was that the drugs were stored at too cold of a temperature, although its expert floated the possibility that there was a problem with how it was mixed, and the state attempted to withhold test results that disagreed with its narrative. \n \nGissendaner\u2019s attorneys argued that the hours she waited not knowing if the \u201ccloudy\u201d drugs would be used on her amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and that it showed the state was likely to use questionable drugs on her in the future. \n \nBut U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash disagreed, finding that the state \u201cdid not intentionally subject [her] to uncertainty for the sake of inflicting more pain upon her.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is not enough to show that the State may obtain defective lethal injection drugs,\u201d the judge wrote when he dismissed the case in August. Gissendaner \u201cmust show that there is a substantial risk that the defective drugs will be used on\u201d her in the future. \n \nHe added that \u201cif anything, the March 2 incident shows that the state is unlikely to use defective drugs on\u201d her. \n \nGissendaner asked him to reconsider his ruling, which the judge declined to do. On Monday, Gissendaner notified the court that she was appealing the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \nGeorgia intends to use compounded drugs again, but this time plans on storing the drugs in a new refrigeration unit to regulate its temperature. \n \nGissendaner also has a petition at the Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution based on her claim that prison officials violated her rights by having \u201cthwarted\u201d the clemency process. \n \nClaiming that officials \u201cactively frustrated the [clemency] procedures established by Georgia law,\u201d Gissendaner\u2019s lawyers write that such actions violated her constitutional due process rights. \n   \nCheck out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "source": "BuzzFeed"}
