The Springboks have made eight changes to the starting line-up and included two new players on the bench to meet the challenge of a talented Samoan team in their second match of the Rugby World Cup at Villa Park in Birmingham on Saturday.\n\nAdriaan Strauss, who will win his 50th cap, is the starting hooker, while Duane Vermeulen will make his first Test appearance of the year in the No 8 jersey as coach Heyneke Meyer reacted swiftly to the shock of defeat against Japan.\n\nWillie le Roux, JP Pietersen and Damian De Allende return in the backline \u2013 with skipper Jean de Villiers shifting to outside centre \u2013 while there are new halfbacks in Handr\u00e9 Pollard and Fourie du Preez. In the pack, Eben Etzebeth returns to the starting line-up with Vermeulen and Strauss. On the bench, Schalk Brits and Frans Malherbe make their first appearance on a Rugby World Cup teamsheet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very tough week after the massive disappointment of last weekend and we owe our supporters a winning performance on Saturday,\u201d said Meyer.\n\n\u201cThe last few days have been a time for retrospection and the team this week has been selected specifically with Samoa in mind, as we know we\u2019ll have to be at our very best to succeed.\n\n\u201cThey will pose a massive challenge and I think it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s the biggest game of the season for us. They have a very strong team with players plying their trade all over the world.\n\n\u201cFour years ago in the World Cup pool match in New Zealand, the Samoans pushed the Boks close and we\u2019re expecting more of the same this weekend. It will be brutally physical and we have to be 100% focused and ready.\u201d\n\nMeyer congratulated Strauss on his 50th cap: \u201cAdriaan is not only a great ambassador for South Africa and the Springboks, but also someone who isn\u2019t shy to put in the dirty work without saying too much.\n\n\u201cHe leads by example and has shown a lot of resilience in coming through trying times. It\u2019s well-deserved and a privilege only a very small percentage of Springboks have achieved. He is a true leader and was an inspirational vice-captain of this team in 2012 and 2013.\u201d\n\nMeyer said it\u2019s also very good to see Vermeulen back in the team. It will be the current South African Rugby Player of the Year\u2019s first Test of 2015 after he underwent neck surgery early in July.\n\n\u201cDuane has been one of the stalwarts of this team and it\u2019s great to have him back in the mix. He is one of the best loose forwards in the world and apart from being a superb ball-carrier and also a great line-out option, he is also good on the ground and brings leadership to the team\u201d, Meier said.\n\nHe also explained that they decided to also give Le Roux, De Allende, Malherbe and Schalk Brits, who was impressive in the second half against Argentina in Buenos Aires last month, a well-deserved run this week to bring some energy and unpredictability to the team. Jesse Kriel and Lood de Jager have proven themselves this season and according to Meier they will need them to also make a massive impact off the bench on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt means some players have dropped out of the squad altogether but this is a 31-man campaign and they will have other chances, but we needed to make changes after Saturday\u2019s performance\u201d, he concluded.\n\nWillem Alberts was the only player not considered because of injury \u2013 he picked up a calf strain during the captain\u2019s run in Brighton last Friday and will be reassessed early next week.\n\nThe team is: 15.
