Personality, Points of View, and Beliefs are also traits that we want to  learn about, and then reveal to you.\u00a0 Back in March when we decided to  ask for your submissions to become part of our\u00a0 Snapped & Caught Series,  we put the ball in our readers court. We were open for almost anything  that came our way, and we welcomed it with open arms. What we didn't  expect was a submission from New York native (and friend to FFM) John Stewart.\u00a0\nFor  those of you that were heavily involved in that downtown, meets lower  east side, meets antique boutique, meets diesel, meets robots, and sugar  babies era of the mid 90's in NYC, chances are you have met John. Once  a heavily pierced face lad, the John Stewart of the past may be gone,  but the underbelly of this intriguing man still lies within.\n\n\nSo how did the coming of \"John\" begin??? Our inductee recalls it all began with his father taking him to The Village. Surrounded by eccentrics, and the carefree, this trip into the city would be one that he would never forget. One can only imagine the feeling of excitement and dare we say a hint of fear the young J.S. was experiencing. \u00a0 \n\n\"The freedom that people displayed was crazy, the unbothered attitude, the fearlessness, struck a cord. I knew I was gonna dress village, work in the village, and BE the village. I never looked back from that mindset\" he shares.\n\nAs if his venture into town weren't enough, the final destination would be. His father was taking him to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the 8th Street Playhouse. \n\u00a0He was celebrating his 13th birthday...\nPivotal points arise in all of our lives,  and in most cases, they happen several times throughout. It can be  visiting a foreign place for the first time, experiencing a breakup, or  receiving a miraculous blessing. How we choose to receive and react to  these moments mold us into the beings that we are today. For John, it  just so happens that one of his life changing moments involving seeing a  man prance on stage in panties and garter belts.\u00a0\u00a0\nThough  the famous musical may have effected our latest Snapped and Caught  inductee to an extent, that doesn't mean that he chooses to mimic the  wardrobe choices of the show.\u00a0 As always, we ask the question, how do  you define your personal style?\u00a0\n\"Hmmmm. Kinda definitely bohemian,urban ,nomadic,future vintage,sporty spice realness, lol. I cant really define it other than to say \"I know what I like,\" he responds. As long as we have known John, his approach to fashion has been rather consistent. That doesn't mean that there hasn't been any mishaps along the way. Stewart shares a story of him being a little boy and wearing bell bottoms. As if to personalize his look, John explains that he would purposely sag the pants to give the illusion they wear drop crotch. But the primary purpose of doing this was to have the widest portion of the pant, completely cover his shoe. (Lets give that a moment...) Yes  John, we agree with you when you say that wasn't one of your better  looks. To pour salt onto the wound, John also shares that he used to  wear bulky sweaters, that he would tuck into his pants with a belt... Welp, we are happy that you left that behind too mister.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0We know that we are sounding a bit tough on John, but for those of you who doesn't actually know him, we should only be fair and inform you that he would have it no other way. John himself is very witty, humorous,sometimes dark, and most of the time very direct.\u00a0\nSlightly more evolved and more defined John recognized that he needed to tweak a little of his approaches to his personal style and how he wanted to be seen.\u00a0\u00a0\n \"I completely know my body now. I know how something is gonna fall, sloach, drape, whatever...When I see something, I know immediately if thats my look. I know how something should fit to fit my temperment.... Its a FEELING!!! A bold POW WOW feeling,'' he laughs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is you current occupation/field of work?Freelance brand specialist\n\n\nHow would you define your personal style?HummmKinda definately bohemian,urban ,nomadic,future vintage,sportyspice realness\u00bf lollI cant really define it other than to say\"I know what i like\"\n\nLooking back at your past, is there a period you now regret fashion wise?LolllWhen  i was a lil boy i used to pull my bellbottoms down dropcrotch style cuz  i thought it was the shit to have the bottom of the pant cover your  shoesAnd wear my sweaters tucked in my pants with a beltWheretheydothatat????....\nHow would you say that your taste have evolved.
