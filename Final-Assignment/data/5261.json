They show up at Salesforce, ready to go, filled with a very deep PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), and our job is to kind of shake them down.\u201d \n \n    \nBusiness Insider \n \nSalesforce President Keith Block speaking at Dreamforce \n    \nBlock was a bit of a controversial figure when he joined Salesforce over two years ago. He had left Oracle the year before joining Salesforce, after court documents revealed him saying nasty things about \u00a0then Oracle\u2019s president and current co-CEO Mark Hurd, and Sun Microsystems, a company Oracle acquired for $7.3 billion under Hurd\u2019s watch. \n \nSince hiring Block in 2013, Benioff has been all praise about his president. Last year, at a press event, he went as far as to say , \u201c[Block's]\u00a0 probably the best sales executive the enterprise software industry has ever seen.\u201d \n \nIn fact, Salesforce has seen nothing but growth since Block\u2019s appointment. It\u2019s been consistently beating earnings guidance, while hitting record-high share prices. Coincidentally, Oracle\u00a0 has missed sales expectations in five of the past six quarters. \n \nThere\u2019s been some reports that Block\u2019s arrival and his\u00a0more rigorous sales culture has caused some long-time executives to leave Salesforce. But regardless, investors largely seem impressed with his results. \n \n\u201cThe kind of things that Salesforce is telgegraphing to the Wall Street community is that it\u2019s broadening out it\u2019s suite, it\u2019s increasing deal sizes, it\u2019s going after larger customers, and it\u2019s revamped its whole sales structure \u2014 and in large part, it\u2019s around the hiring of Keith Block of Oracle,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead told us in a previous interview. \n  NOW WATCH: New aerial footage shows aftermath of explosion in China      \n \n   \n   \nRead more stories on Business Insider , Malaysian edition of the world\u2019s fastest-growing business and technology news website.", "source": "Business Insider Malaysia"}
