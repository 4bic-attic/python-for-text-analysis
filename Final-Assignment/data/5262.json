He also enjoys almost any physical game, but his favorite is hide-and-seek, which he plays with his 8-year-old sister, Emily. \n\nOutgoing and friendly, James is becoming more expressive in communicating. He likes going to school, especially art class. \n\nEmily is carefree, with an easy laugh. Playing dress-up, painting her nails, and creating crafts are just a few of her favorite activities. Animals, particularly dogs, are important to her; she is very fond of Buddy, the poodle in her foster home. \n\nEmily is an excellent listener, a quick learner, and a compassionate child, always ready to give an encouraging hug to those around her. Like her brother, art class is the best part of her school day. \n\nJames and Emily are very close and need to be adopted together. They would thrive in a patient, loving family, either two-parent or single-parent. These appealing children would bring great joy to the family that welcomes them into its home. \n\nJames, Emily, and other children are available for adoption.
