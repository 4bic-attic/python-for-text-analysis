The thing that I really harp on is that, that in and of itself is a choice, it\u2019s a personal choice, because there are many people who don\u2019t do that. In buying those uniforms, you\u2019re saying something about yourself, and about how you feel about clothing and culture. There is no such thing as an unaffected fashion choice. Anti-fashion is fashion, because it\u2019s a reaction to the current visual culture, a negation of it.\u201d\n\n - Deirdre Clemente, cultural historian at University of Nevada Las Vegas", "source": "Put This On"}
