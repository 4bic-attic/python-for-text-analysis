Before him stood an audience of hundreds roaring with applause as a scrum of photographers snapped shutters like machine guns.\n\nIn blue cotton trousers, a button-up olive green shirt and rubber-soled shoes, Ai put his iPhone back in his shirt pocket, pleated his hands Angela Merkel-style and discussed China in a Berlin international literature festival talk alongside Chinese dissident poet Liao Yiwu, in what was called \u201ca conversation between friends.\u201d\n\nIt was Ai\u2019s first public appearance since his detainment in 2011. He arrived in Berlin soon after having had his passport returned without warning by Chinese authorities on 22 July. He had been arrested without charge and held in solitary confinement, and fined $2.4 million for tax evasion, but the artist sees the episode as retaliation for criticising the government. For the past two years, Ai protested his travel ban with a fresh batch of flowers in a bicycle basket outside his Beijing studio.\n\nThe 58-year-old artist spoke slowly through a German translator as Liao played devil\u2019s advocate with his line of questioning. It was such a monotone affair that an audience member interrupted, asking them to speak up.\n\nThe philosophical discussion ran from Confucius to censorship. Ai cleared the score when it came to hearsay. \u201cThis audience expects me to speak about this sentence that I allegedly said, the arrest of lawyers is not a big deal,\u201d said Ai. \u201cWhen I said the arrest of all lawyers is not a major topic, I did not want to insinuate this is to be seen in the context of today\u2019s laws. I meant it in the context of history. It has not been a major topic in our history. When you live in a centralised regime, people feel powerless. They feel they don't have the possibility to change things \u201cLawyers are defending law, but law in a country where the system is not a healthy one, the lawyer could be arrested,\u201d said Ai. \u201cThis will be the case until we have the rule of law.\u201d Ai\u2019s lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, who was arrested, still awaits trail.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a centralised regime, people feel powerless,\u201d the artist said. \u201cThey feel they don\u2019t have the possibility to change things; that is the intention of the regime.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ai Weiwei, left, and Chinese poet Liao Yiwu take part in a discussion at the Berlin international literature festival. Photograph: Adam Berry/ Liao asked about the feeling of guilt for political prisoners. \u201cThere is always a feeling of guilt,\u201d said Ai, who cited his own jail time, and works inspired by his time in detention. \n\n\u201cI never felt my freedom completely taken away from me.\u201d\n\nWhen asked the price he had paid to overcome censorship, Ai said: \u201cHe who does not play along is presented as enemy of the state.\u201d\n\nWatching artists talk politics is always a bit elliptical. Liao, who was jailed for his poetry, and has written books about Chinese Christianity, asked about fear as a motivator for art. Ai said: \u201cHe who lives in a dictatorship fears he cannot express his joy or happiness and fears he cannot prove himself. A nation can't think freely any more. Censorship means barriers are built so people can't move on; there is no hope \u201cA nation can\u2019t think freely any more, which is tragic,. Such a censorship system means barriers are built so people can\u2019t move on; there is no hope any more.\u201d\n\nSome questions were paradoxical, sounding a bit like haikus. \u201cA German journalist said you live in freedom but you\u2019re not free: I wonder what that means,\u201d said Liao. \u201cI feel you are free. Why do they say you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\nLiao may have been referring to Ai\u2019s recent kerfuffle with German newspaper Die Zeit on Instagram, in which Ai said the paper misquoted him and \u201cdramatically altered the character and context of the interview\u201d.\n\nAi said he found it difficult to talk about freedom after coming to Germany. \u201cI feel calm,\u201d he said, skirting the issue. \u201cI try to approach things in a rational way.\u201d\n\nOn the influx refugees to Germany, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s global policy, religion, ethnic groups, races and attitudes; everybody is responsible here for finding a solution.\u201d\n\nLiao suggested Ai\u2019s large Berlin studio could house refugees. \u201cMy studio should be a studio,\u201d Ai retorted. The audience applauded.\n\nThere were some comical moments. Liao quipped about Ai\u2019s online photos, some of which have him \u201cwith his drawers dropped.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no hero in the world born with his trousers on,\u201d said Ai. \u201cA person without trousers is not a dangerous person, but when the police consider him a criminal, he finds it difficult to get a passport in China later and a UK visa.\u201d\n\nFor the last question, Liao asked if Ai thinks he\u2019ll be able to leave China again. \u201cYou should not ask at all if I can re-leave China again,\u201d said Ai.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ai Weiwei signs books in Berlin. Photograph: Adam Berry/ After the talk, hundreds of fans queued through the theatre for a book signing, which became a selfie session. Mostly everyone who bought a collection of his banned blog posts wanted a photo with the artist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an autograph session! Not a selfie session!\u201d hollered German writer Wolfgang Herles, who introduced the talk.\n\nHe was right, but nobody listened. Cellphones waved through the air. Ai, a social media veteran, didn\u2019t refuse either. He became the selfie Santa Claus of the night as he scribbled through paperbacks and posed. Instead of buying books, people paid for selfies. Not a bad deal for \u20a47.35.", "source": "Guardian.co.uk"}
