Today, at last I found time to spend in my craft room! We do seem to have been out and about a lot recently so I have only been playing in my\u00a0journals(and I do mean playing!!)\nI came up with this\n\u00a0Stencilled leaves onto gessoed tag so that I could encourage some drips, then another leaf mask with Grunge Paste, rubbed over with Inca gold and Burnt Umber DecoArt Media fluid acrylics, then stems painted in with Burnt Sienna. The leaves\u00a0around the edge from a sunflower stamp and words printed out on the computer. I know that there are 10 leaves but the 9 is for September and the song I am sure you have guessed, is the old Frank Sinatra classic 'September in the Rain' - although I must say how lucky we are at the moment to have some sunny weather after the rain at the beginning\u00a0of the month!\nI may have mislead you into thinking I got a super shot of the moon last night - huh!! I need a new camera!!!!\nThe best I could do - but I really did enjoy seeing it, just as I had enjoyed seeing the moon the morning before at 6.00am(can't go all night without a loo trip!)By the time I had found my camera it had almost\u00a0disappeared\u00a0behind the hill at the caravan.\nIt was a red ball in the sky when I saw it!!\nThis evening - the clouds are a beautiful pink\u2026I love Autumn!! \u00a0\nFrom another Frank Sinatra classic - Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December But the days grow short when you reach September When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame \u00a0Thanks for\u00a0looking, Chris", "source": "pearshapedcrafting"}
