The media platform will also produce a video interview series called\u00a0Deflowered\u00a0that will profile innovators in the industry, cultural and lifestyle features and the latest news on cannabis policy, business and economics. Information on marijuana products and a location mapping service for dispensaries will also be published on the website. \n \nSpeaking at the launch Snoop Dogg said after watching how the cannabis industry had developed since legalisation in a number of states \u201cI wanted to create a platform that will take this movement further by creating a destination where people could find fresh content\u201d. He described Merry Jane as \u201ca game-changing platform for pop culture. It\u2019s a new frontier y\u2019all!\u201d \n \nThe 43 year-old rap and film star also said he hopes it will give people \u201can opportunity to come out of the closet and just admit they like to smoke\u201d. \n \nMarijuana is now a multibillion dollar industry and the Merry Jane brand will look to tap into the retail side of it too according to Chung who hopes the brand can become a leading destination for brands and retail businesses. \n \nThe platform is scheduled to launch in October and is currently sending invitations to a select number of beta testers; 420 according to Snoop. \n \nSnoop Dogg is not the only musician to attempt to build a brand around the bustling cannabis industry. Willie Nelson recently partnered with Tuatara Capital LP, a New York-based investment firm focused on the legal cannabis industry. The deal will help support and expand the launch of Nelson\u2019s marijuana brand, Willie\u2019s Reserve, which is due to launch this month. Willie\u2019s Reserve will be grown distributed and sold in Colorado and Washington, where marijuana has been legalised, with plans to expand to other states who legalise it for recreational use.", "source": "The Drum"}
