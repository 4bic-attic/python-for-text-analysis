However, his support for a carbon trading scheme, gay marriage and an Australian republic have made him unpopular with his party\u2019s right wing. \n \nTurnbull is widely expected to overhaul the cabinet, with current Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been battling a backlash against a deeply unpopular budget, likely to be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison. \n \nDefense Minister Kevin Andrews, who is overseeing a A$50 billion ($35.70 billion) submarine tender, is also expected to be replaced when Turnbull unveils his ministry later this week. \n \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop, who won the party room vote to retain her additional position as deputy prime minister, said she had spoken with international leaders overnight about the leadership change. \n \nThe opposition Labor Party was quick to label Turnbull a \u201cmulti-millionaire who lives in a pink mansion on Sydney Harbour\u201d who was out of touch with everyday Australians. \n \nThe change of leaders is the latest sign of political instability in Australia, which has in recent years been convulsed by backroom machinations and party coups that have shaken public and business confidence in government. \n \nLabor\u2019s Kevin Rudd, elected prime minister with a strong mandate in 2007, was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010 amid the same sort of poll numbers that Abbott faced. Gillard was in turn deposed by Rudd ahead of elections won by Abbott in 2013. \n \n($1 = 1.4006 Australian dollars) \n \n(Reporting by Jane Wardell; Editing by Dean Yates)", "source": "SRN News"}
