EH348). I received this kit as a Sinterklaas present last year.\nNext, this is RICO design kit 79909.54.00. I bought this kit during our summer vacation in Heidelberg and I've stitched it there as well.\nThis is 'Spakenburg' by Thea Gouverneur. This kit was a birthday present that Carolien gave me. I made some slight alterations, like I left out one of the boats and I did the eyes a little different.\nThe pattern for this squirrel came from the book Mollie Makes - Woodland Friends. I added an extra colour plus the acorn.\nAnd finally, this is 'Man's Best Friend' by Magie Hollingworth. I made this cushion cover as a present for my mom's 90th birthday. It was so much fun to make this cushion and to have all these dogs look at you while stitching. I bought this kit from The Tapestry Shop during a previous edition of the Handwerkbeurs.", "source": "Peppy"}
