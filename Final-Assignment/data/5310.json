The campaign slogan, 'It Can Wait,' promotes safe and focused driving. Last year this campaign placed in the top 10 at the National DECA Conference. \n  \nThis year's campaign will run from September 28 to October 2. In an effort to make drivers of all ages in the Valley aware of the dangers of texting and driving, CHS DECA hopes to reach beyond the high school and target the campaign to the entire community through the support of the public media. \n     Subscription Required  \n An online service is needed to view this article in its entirety.
