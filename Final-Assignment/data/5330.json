Surely it says somewhere: Don't joke about American politics in public \u2014 leave that\u00a0to the Yanks. \n\nSo she found herself apologizing Thursday for something she thought was a throwaway line but which sent some Twitter users and Fox News pundits into a patriotic fury. \n\n\"It was so not my\u00a0intention to hurt anybody or cause offense, and I really apologize\u00a0to those I caused offense,\" she told Savannah Guthrie on the Today show. \"It was\u00a0just an offhand joke.\u00a0I think I\u2019ll probably leave the political jokes to late night or something.\u201d \n\nProbably wise, at least for the time being. \n\nBlunt just took the naturalization\u00a0oath and became an American by virtue of her marriage to actor John Krasinski. \n\nIn the midst of promoting her forthcoming action-thriller, Sicario , in which she plays an FBI agent involved in the drug-war,\u00a0Blunt was asked about GOP frontrunner Donald\u00a0Trump by\u00a0 The Hollywood Reporter \u00a0during a session at the Toronto International Film Festival. She joked that she watched the\u00a0first Republican debate the night she was sworn in\u00a0\"and I thought, 'This was a terrible mistake. What have I done?' \" \n\nShe told a similar joke to People at a screening of the movie in New York on Tuesday. \n\nSome Americans were not amused. \n\nLater, on Jimmy Kimmel Live , \u00a0 she also\u00a0said she was a little sad about having to renounce allegiance to \"foreign princes,\" as the citizenship oath calls for, because she didn't want to renounce Queen Elizabeth II, who's the\u00a0great-great-granddaughter of the queen she played in Young Victoria . Besides, she said, \"I like being British.\" \n\n(For the record, Brits who become American citizens are dual citizens, because under British law anyone born British stays British no matter how many other citizenships they may take up.) \n\nBut on Fox &\u00a0Friends , the conservative network's morning show, her jokes were taken as a slam at Republicans and at citizenship. On Tuesday, co-host Anna Kooiman was blunt about Blunt: Get out, she said. \n\n\"Well you know what, then why don't you leave Hollywood,\u00a0California, and let some American\u00a0women take on the roles that you're\u00a0getting, because Americans are watching your\u00a0movies and lining your pockets,\" Kooiman said. \n\nAdded Steve Doocy: \"You know what Emily Blunt just did? She just Dixie Chicked herself.\u00a0She has alienated half the country, that now will think twice about going\u00a0to one of her movies.\" \n\nThere was some sympathy for Blunt on Twitter after that. \n\nStill, some repair work was necessary. Thus, the chat with Guthrie on\u00a0 Today . Besides apologizing, Blunt said her swearing-in ceremony was important to her. \n\n\"It was really meaningful \u2014\u00a0my two favorite people in the world are Americans, my husband and my daughter,\" she said. \n\nAnd, she added, having taken the citizenship test, she now knows more about American history than British history.", "source": "Kenly News"}
