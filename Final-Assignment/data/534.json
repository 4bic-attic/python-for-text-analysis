For the past three years, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and the Colombian government have been engaged in peace talks in Cuba, but an outcome has not yet been reached.  \u00a0  \u201cAt this time I feel bound to direct my thoughts to the beloved land of Colombia,\u201d he said, \u201cconscious of the crucial importance of the present moment when, with renewed effort and inspired by hope, its sons and daughters are seeking to build a peaceful society.\u201d  \u00a0  Although much innocent blood has been shed in the decades of armed conflict, he hopes that their sacrifice, united with Christ\u2019s, may \u201csustain all the efforts being made, including those on this beautiful island, to achieve definitive reconciliation.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cThus may the long night of pain and violence can, with the support of all Colombians, become an unending day of concord, justice, fraternity and love, in respect for institutions and for national and international law, so that there may be lasting peace,\u201d the Holy Father said.  \u00a0  Turning his attention to the example of the Blessed Mother, the pontiff urged those present to \u201cplace all our concerns and hopes before the heart of Christ.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cWe pray to her in a special way for those who have lost hope and find no reasons to keep fighting, and for those who suffer from injustice, abandonment and loneliness,\u201d he said.  \u00a0  Like Mary, we must learn to \u201ckeep our hearts awake and attentive to the needs of others\u201d and the \u201clittle details of life\u201d so that no one will lack \u201cthe joy which Jesus brings us.\u201d  \u00a0  Pope Francis then prayed for all those experiencing difficulty, especially the Cubans whom he called the \u201csons and daughters\u201d of Mary.", "source": "Angelus The Tidings Online"}
