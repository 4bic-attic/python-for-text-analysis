Right after my last post I discovered that Avery was having a harder time with the classroom transition than I understood, so that was stressful. I think the situation has gotten smoother, but we are definitely still working on it! Maddie has done beautifully so far and I am still shocked that she has not shown any signs of being more tired than usual... the energy level of that munchkin is astounding.\nLast weekend I took Maddie to her very first professional Mani/Pedi and the girl was an absolute natural! She got to sit right next to me in a chair that was exactly her size and a little DVD player all to herself. Baby Bub really enjoyed herself and I was pleasantly surprised that she didn't have any issues with the trimming/filing/buffing/tickling OR staying still. Miraculous!\nFeeling pampered Watching so closely The best part was when I looked over and saw this! I'm\u00a0still not sure if this was all on her own or if she saw me\u00a0doing something similar, but I don't care, it's hilarious. The girl has got. it. down. Wish I could take Avery to do fun stuff like this too. Lord knows that girl needs all the pampering she could get! She's not a big fan of us messing with her nails though... that's ok, Maddie Brynn will be my little spa girl :).", "source": "A Bub's Life"}
