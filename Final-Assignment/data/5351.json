Heights Dr., Mustang \n \nTV: KSBI-52 (Cox 7) \n \nRecords: Edmond Memorial 1-1; Mustang 2-0 \n \nLast week:\u00a0 Edmond Memorial 27, Edmond North 14 \u2014 Memorial quarterback Grant Decker was big with two touchdown runs and 127 rushing yards to go along with his one TD pass as Memorial dominated its city rival. \n \nMustang 41, Stillwater 14 \u2014 Mustang posted 447 yards of total offense \u2014 including 291 passing from Wyoming commitment Chandler Garrett \u2014 to avoid a second straight year of being upset by Stillwater \n \nPlayers to watch: Edmond Memorial \u2014 Zeke Mammen , LB. Mammen recently verbally committed to Emporia State. He\u2019ll be tasked with anchoring a solid Bulldogs defense that has its hands full trying to slow down Mustang\u2019s juggernaut offense. \n \nMustang \u2014 Blake Williams , TE. Williams is off to an incredible start to the season. Against Stillwater, he caught all three TD passes from Garrett and he caught a big one in the opener against rival Yukon. At this point, teams have to find a way to slow down Williams, perhaps with some extra coverage. \n \nStorylines: Edmond Memorial \u2014 The Bulldogs struggled in Week 1 to slow down Southmoore\u2019s potent offense. By all accounts, Mustang\u2019s offense is even more prolific. If they can pressure Garrett and force some mistakes, that could change things. \n \nMustang \u2014 Slow down Decker. He\u2019s elusive in the pocket and is capable of creating something from nothing. Southmoore had success by countering his elusiveness by blanketing his receivers while scrambling, which forced multiple mistakes. \n \nThe pick: Mustang 35, Edmond Memorial 21", "source": "NewsOK.com"}
