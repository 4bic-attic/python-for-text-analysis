He will make one time victory. Even with that, he will still set a record. I am confident of that,\u201d he stated in an interview with Radio Gold Tuesday.\nHe said Ghanaians will admit that the achievement of the Mahama-led administration is unprecedented if they begin to tell their story from one sector to the other.\nThe acting Presidential spokesperson also dismissed concerns over the decision by a youth organiser of the NDC George Boateng to contest the President in the upcoming presidential and parliamentary primaries of the party.\n\u201cI think to even discuss that may not be the best use of time. I believe strongly that whoever contests Mahama will lose abysmally,\u201d he noted.\rComments:\nThis article has 1 comments, leave your comment.", "source": "ModernGhana News"}
