Will McLaughlin: On Draft Duel I won over $62,000 dollars, is what I would've been saying if I had made some slightly different choice in players. NARRATOR: Draft Duel is easy. Just choose a league, pick a team, and throw your money into a cyber garbage bin of hope. Michael Cassady: Thanks to a loop whole in the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act, this isn't gambling. It's just wagering money on sports. Carlos Santos: There's dollar games, $2 dollar games. Will Hines: I spent $150 dollars on draft duel which I was going to use to take out my wife, but I didn't win. Then my wife left me, which means I have more to spend on next week. I got my friends at work to join, and I made 6 grand in one week, mostly off of them. NARRATOR: Leagues last one week so you can choose when you play. You can play during the day. You can play in the middle of the night when your wife screams, \"Seriously, Derek, get out of my life!\" NARRATOR: Over one million people have already won money on Draft Duel, and you get your money right away so you can bet it again, and lose it all the following week. Each player has a value. You just pick your team, and you make your bet. Week one, you may win 20 bucks. Week 2, doesn't go so hot. Week 3, you double down, and it also doesn't go so hot. I won $2000 dollars from a pawn shop where I sold my wedding ring. Jocelyn just needs to trust me more. I mean, that's what a wife does, ex-wife. Ex, that's the first time I said that out loud. My God. Does anybody want to buy my car? Week 5, you've thrown your phone into the river, because you're tired of your friends calling up and asking for their money back. NARRATOR: And with Draft Duels money back guarantee, you have nothing to lose. I have nothing left to lose. I have nothing left to lose. I have, nothing.
