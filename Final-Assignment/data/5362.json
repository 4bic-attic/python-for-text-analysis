With our increased financial flexibility, we are intensifying our efforts in R&D to enrich our pipeline of first-in-class proprietary antibodies. \n\n As important new clinical data on lirilumab is generated, Innate Pharma is on track to leverage its unique positioning in the very promising area of immuno-oncology.\" \n\n A conference call will be held today at 2:30pm (CET)  \n\nDial in numbers: France: + 01 70 77 09 37 / International: +1\u00a0855\u00a0402 77 61 \n\nA replay will be available on Innate Pharma's website after the conference call. \n\n Financial highlights of the first-half of 2015 : \n\nThe key elements are as follows: \nCash, cash equivalents and current financial instruments amounting to \u20ac279m (million euros) at June 30, 2015 (\u20ac69m at December 31, 2014), following the receipt on June\u00a030, 2015 of $250m (\u20ac223m) relating to the co-development and commercialization agreement signed on April 24, 2015 with AstraZeneca. At the same date, the financial liabilities amounted to \u20ac4.0m (\u20ac4.2m at December\u00a031, 2014).   Revenue and other income amounting to \u20ac6.4m (\u20ac4.1m for the first half of 2014). This amounts results from licensing revenue (\u20ac3.1m) and from research tax credit (\u20ac3.3m). Revenue related to the licensing agreements mainly results from spreading the initial payment received by Innate Pharma in the context of the agreement signed in April 2015 with AstraZeneca over the costs of the clinical trials the Company is in charge of.   Operating expenses amounting to \u20ac15.5m (\u20ac13.2m for the first half of 2014) of which 82% related to research and development. The increase of these expenses mainly results from the rise of the staff (110 employees on June 30, 2015 to be compared to 90 on June 30, 2014).  As a consequence of the items mentioned previously, the net loss for the first half of 2015 amounts to \u20ac7.0m (\u20ac9.0m for the first half of 2014).  \nThe table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, with a comparison to the same period in 2014: \n\u00a0   6-month period ended June 30   In thousands of euros (IFRS)   2015   2014  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  3,092  1,027  Government financing for research expenditures  3,344  3,110   Operating revenue   6,436   4,137  Research and development expenses  (12,754)  (10,890)  General and administrative expenses  (2,728)  (2,310)   Operating expenses   (15,482)   (13,200)   Operating income / (loss)   (9,046)   (9,063)  Financial income (expenses), net  2,072  195  Share of profit (loss) of associates and joint ventures  -  (170)   Net income / (loss)   (6,974)   (9,039)  \n Update on R&D portfolio: \n\n Lirilumab (anti-KIR antibody), partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb:  \nEffiKIR (double-blind placebo-controlled randomized Phase II trial of lirilumab as maintenance treatment in elderly patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in first complete remission - study IPH2102-201):  \nIn March 2015, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (\"DSMB\") completed its fourth assessment of the EffiKIR study and recommended to stop treatment in one arm and continue the trial with the remaining two arms as per protocol. There was no concern with tolerance. The DSMB considered that treatment in the stopped arm could not be superior to placebo. The trial remains blinded. \n\nIn September 2015, the DSMB completed its fifth assessment of the EffiKIR study and recommended continuation of the trial without modification. \n\nThe Company expects that analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint, Leukemia-free survival, will occur in Q2 2016.\u00a0 \nTwo new Phase II trials started with lirilumab in hematological malignancies in H1 2015:  \nIn the first semester of 2015, two new clinical trials were started by Bristol-Myers Squibb and are being performed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center: a trial testing lirilumab in combination with rituximab in relapsed/ refractory or high-risk untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and a trial of lirilumab in combination with Vidaza in relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia. \nMultiple combinations of lirilumab, including with nivolumab, are currently being explored in four trials in different \u00a0hematological malignancies; in addition, the combination of lirilumab and nivolumab is being investigated in various solid tumors.  \n IPH2201 (anti-NKG2A antibody), partnered with AstraZeneca/Medimmune:  \n\nOn April 24, 2015, Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca/Medimmune announced the signature of a co-development and commercialization agreement to accelerate and broaden the development of Innate Pharma's proprietary anti-NKG2A antibody, IPH2201, including in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736), an anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor developed by MedImmune. \n\nThe financial terms of the agreement include cash payments of up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma as well as double digit royalties on sales. The initial payment is $250 million to Innate Pharma. In addition, AstraZeneca will pay to Innate a further $100 million prior to initiation of Phase\u00a0III development, as well as regulatory and sales-related milestones of up to $925 million. AstraZeneca will book all sales and will pay double-digit royalties on net sales to Innate. The arrangement includes the right for Innate to co-promote in Europe for a 50% profit share in the territory. \n\nThe initial development plan includes: Phase II combination clinical trials with durvalumab in solid tumors; multiple Phase II trials planned by Innate to study IPH2201 both as monotherapy and in combination with currently approved treatments across a range of cancers; and the development of associated biomarkers. \n\nIn June 2015, the agreement received HSR clearance ** , allowing the companies to start working together. On June 30, 2015, Innate Pharma received the initial payment of $250m from AstraZeneca. \n\nAs part of Innate's initial development plan, IPH2201 is currently tested in a Phase II trial as a single agent in a pre-operative setting of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, a tumor type representative of the larger group of squamous cell cancer of the Head and Neck, performed in Germany. Innate Pharma expects to start three additional trials in 2015, testing IPH2201 as a single agent in Ovarian Cancer, in combination with ibrutinib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and in combination with cetuximab in Head and Neck Cancer. The trial testing IPH2201 in Ovarian cancer will be conducted by NCIC Clinical Trials Group in Canada. \n\n IPH4102 (anti-KIR3DL2 antibody):  \n \nIPH4102 is a first-in-class cytotoxic antibody in development by Innate Pharma for the treatment of some types of KIR3DL2-expressing cancers, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and in particular their aggressive forms Sezary Syndrome (\"SS\") and Transformed Mycosis Fungoides (\"TMF\"). \n\nIn 2015, Innate Pharma submitted a first clinical trial application for IPH4102 in Europe and the US for an international Phase I trial involving referral expert centers. First approvals have been received from French, UK and US regulatory authorities and enrolment is expected to start by the end of the year. \n\n Antibody-drug conjugate technology:  \n\nOn April 16, 2015, Innate Pharma announced that it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Sanofi to apply Innate Pharma's site-specific conjugation technology to the development of new Antibody Drug Conjugates. \n\n Corporate update: \n\n Translational research agreement with IPC:  \n\nIn July 2015, Innate Pharma and the Paoli Calmettes Institute (IPC), a private not-for-profit comprehensive cancer center in Marseille, France, signed a collaboration agreement to conduct translational research aimed at identifying specific populations of patients with hematological cancers who may benefit most from treatment with Innate Pharma's novel proprietary antibodies, and at identifying associated biomarkers. \n\n Unsponsored ADR program:  \n\nIn September 2015, Citi launched an unsponsored ADR of Innate Pharma.

This revenue is spread over the costs of the clinical trials the Company is in charge of. \n\nAt June 30, 2014, this line item only came from the licensing agreement signed with Bristol-Myers Squibb in July 2011 (\u20ac24.9m). This recognition is almost completed. \n\nGovernment funding for research costs is mainly composed of the research tax credit (\u20ac3.3m\u00a0for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to \u20ac3.1m for the same year-ago period). The 2014 research tax credit should be received by the end of the fiscal year (\u20ac6.5m). \n\n Operating expenses, by business function \n\nThe following table breaks down the net operating expenses by function for the periods under review: \n In thousands of euros   June 30, 2015   June 30, 2014  Research and development expenses  (12,754)  (10,890)  General and administrative expenses  (2,728)  (2,310)   Operating expenses   (15,482)   (13,200)  \nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses include the cost of employees assigned to research and development operations (including employees assigned to work under the collaboration and licensing agreements), product manufacturing costs, subcontracting costs as well as costs of materials (reagents and other consumables) and pharmaceutical products. \n\nThe variance in R&D expenses between the two periods under review (\u20ac12.8m at June 30, 2015 versus \u20ac10.9m at June 30, 2014, or +17%) mainly results from the staff costs (+\u20ac1.4m), consumables (+\u20ac0.4m) and intellectual property costs (+\u20ac0.3m). The reason of these variances is explained in the next page. \n\nR&D expenses accounted for 82% of operating expenses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 (2014: 83%). \n\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses mostly comprise costs of the \"support\" staff as well as external expenses for the management and development of our business. The rise of these costs mainly results from an increase in staff costs (\u20ac0.4m). \n\nG&A expenses accounted for 18% of operating expenses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 (2014: 17%). \n\n Operating expenses, by business nature \n\nThe following table breaks down the net operating expenses by nature of expense for the periods under review: \n In thousands of euros   June 30, 2015   June 30, 2014  Costs of supplies and consumable materials  (1,179)  (788)  Intellectual property expenses  (513)  (265)  Other purchases and external expenses  (7,214)  (7,358)  Employee benefits other than share-based compensation  (5,114)  (3,556)  Share-based payments  (272)  -  Depreciation and amortization  (977)  (1,082)  Other income and (expenses), net  (215)  (150)   Operating expenses   (15,482)   (13,200)  \nThe changes in the most significant line items can be analysed as follows: \nCosts of supplies and consumable materials: the rise in these expenses between the two periods (\u20ac1.2m at June 30, 2015 compared to \u20ac0.8m at June 30, 2014, or +50%) mainly results from the increase of the discovery activities;  Intellectual property costs: this increase mainly results from the costs in relation to IPH2201 bought in February 2014;  Other purchases and external expenses: the variance of the line item between the two periods results from the decrease of the subcontracting costs (-\u20ac0.4m) partly offset by legal costs in relation to the AstraZeneca agreement (\u20ac0.2m);  Employee benefits other than share-based compensation: the increase in these expenses between the two periods (\u20ac5.1m at June 30, 2015 compared to \u20ac3.2m at June 30, 2014, or +44%) mainly results from the recruitment of around 20 employees (\u20ac0.9m) and an increase of the collective bonus following the agreement with AstraZeneca.  \n Balance sheet items: \n\nCash, cash equivalents and financial instruments amounted to \u20ac278.9m at June 30, 2015, as compared to \u20ac69.2m at December 31, 2014.
