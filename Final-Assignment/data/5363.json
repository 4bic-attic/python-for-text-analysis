I was in college radio. No one was banking on me. \"You know what -- I did the most shocking thing in my career: I was on a family show,\" Stern later tells a man on the street. \"One of the nicest things that has happened is I'll go to a restaurant and parents will bring over their 10-year-olds to sit on my lap to take a picture,\" he continues. \"I'm like 'Oh, my God!' It's kind of funny to me because this never happened to me in my career.\" Watch the entire video below. Will you miss Stern?
