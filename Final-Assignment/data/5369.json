(Ben Schumin) Perhaps the introduction of the so-called healthier, more adult-focused Thin Oreos earlier this year was a sign that Mondelez, the maker behind the cookies and a plethora of other snacks, was on the fast track to being a health-conscious brand. The company vowed today to revamp its offering so that in five years 50% of its revenue comes from healthy snacks. Executive vice president and chief growth officer Mark Clouse says in the release that the company currently records just one-third of its sales from healthy snacks. \u201cWe intend to become the global leader in well-being snacks,\u201d he says in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to simplify and enhance the ingredient and nutritional profile of our base business while also focusing on breakthrough innovation to address consumers\u2019 well-being needs.\u201d To achieve the new health-focused goal, Clouse says the company will dedicate 70% of new product development efforts on \u201cwell-being platforms.\u201d Those efforts will likely include more individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors, Reuters reports. \u201cIf you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,\u201d Clouse said. In addition to turning toward more healthy fare, Mondelez reaffirmed on Thursday its commitment to increasing revenue of organic products by 3% this year.
