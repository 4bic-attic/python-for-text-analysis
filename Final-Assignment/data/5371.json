SM is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of mast cells. In patients with advanced forms of the disease, mast cells accumulate in organs, such as the bone marrow, intestines, spleen and liver, compromising organ function. There are no approved targeted therapies for SM patients with KIT D816V-driven disease.\n\nIn this Phase 1 trial, Blueprint Medicines plans to enroll approximately 60 patients with advanced SM, which includes aggressive SM with associated hematological non-mast cell disorders (SM-AHNMD) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and other relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies at multiple sites in Europe \n\nIn July, Blueprint Medicines also announced the acceptance of INDs to advance BLU-285 into a Phase 1 trial for unresectable, treatment-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and BLU-554 into a Phase 1 trial for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). \n\nAbout Blueprint Medicines Blueprint Medicines makes kinase drugs to treat patients with genomically defined diseases. Led by a team of industry innovators, Blueprint Medicines integrates a novel target discovery engine and a proprietary compound library to understand the blueprint of cancer and craft highly selective therapies.
