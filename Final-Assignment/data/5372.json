The decision for one-time payment of arrears to widows and disabled jawans is being appreciated. Only some politically motivated people, who retired as officers, have decided to continue the protest,\u201d a BJP leader said. \n\r \nThere are about 24 lakh ex-servicemen; the POBR make up the overwhelming majority. The number of widows is nearly six lakh. \n\r \nEarlier in the day, defence minister Manohar Parrikar briefed BJP spokespersons on the contours of the OROP decision, requesting them not only to defend the government\u2019s decision but also attack the Congress\u2019s failure to implement the decision. \n\r \nAfter the announcement, BJP chief Amit Shah thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the implementation. \n\r \n\u201cEvery year, Rs 9,000-10,000 crore more will go to the ex-servicemen. The Modi government has given economic security to them as well as the serving personnel who will retire later. The BJP hails the Prime Minister for this,\u201d Shah said. \n\r \nShah attacked the Congress for sitting over the demand and reducing their pension from 70% to 50% of the salary in 1973 (when it was in power). \u201cThe previous Congress government, in its last moments, made an allocation of Rs 500 crore for it and this was a joke with servicemen,\u201d Shah said. \n\r \nBJP secretary Shrikant Sharma accused the Congress of playing negative politics over the issue after having failed to resolve in the last 40 years, and appealed to it to act as \u201cconstructive\u201d opposition. \n\r \nIn tweets, Shah said the historic decision is a \u201cbig step for the welfare of soldiers, the real life heroes\u201d. \u201cThe decision will go a long way in boosting the morale of our soldiers and their families,\u201d he said.", "source": "Hindustan Times"}
