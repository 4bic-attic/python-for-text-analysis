Shortly before his death in February 2013 he had posted on Facebook about his excitement at moving to a flat and said he was waiting for a deposit to be organised. \n\nThere is no suggestion Wonga acted unlawfully or knew that it had left Mr Sparham-Price pennyless. \n\nMr Pollard, who found that the teenager took his own life, invoked a rule which requires coroners to demand action to be taken by organisations when they fear future similar deaths. The case was heard a year ago but has only come to light after it was reported by the Disability News Service. \n\nThe coroner was disturbed \u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
