General Assembly gathering in New York.\n\u00a0\u201cYou do always see it this time of year, a lot of heads of state coming in [because of the U.N.],\" said\u00a0Kal Raustiala, director of the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA.\u00a0 \"It makes sense for them to tack on something else.\u201d The General Assembly has created a cottage industry of sorts of international events happening alongside the U.N. meetings. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in New York because everybody\u2019s in New York,\u201d Raustiala said.\nXi, Modi and the pontiff will all be delivering speeches at a U.N. global development summit beginning Friday that is expected to attract a record 150 heads of state and government,\u00a0 U.N. spokeswoman Francyne Harrigan told the Los Angeles Times.\nOther notables expected in New York next week include Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Cuban President Raul Castro. cComments Got something to say?

At the same time, China\u2019s economy is 4.5 times as large as India\u2019s because it\u2019s grown much faster over the last 25 years,\" Anil Gupta, an expert on the U.S.-India-China triangle and chair in strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Times this week.\nIn the technology sector, \"Under Xi Jinping, China has become decidedly unfriendly to multinational companies while India has become more fundamentally open to multinationals, not just in technology but in sectors like autos and telecoms,\" Gupta said.\nState Department historians weren't sure whether this week's\u00a0simultaneous visits by world leaders were unusual, a spokeswoman said. The department tracks historical data on visits by foreign leaders here.\nAnother event that drew a large roster of foreign dignitaries to the U.S. was former President Ronald Reagan's funeral in 2004. Nearly 40 current and former world leaders attended the service\u00a0at the Washington National Cathedral.\nFollow @MattDPearce for national news\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times Privacy Policy", "source": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times"}
