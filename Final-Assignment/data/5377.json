In addition, if the digesters produce more electricity than the farm needs, the farmer sells that electricity to the electric company.\u00a0 This helps pay for the cost and maintenance of the digester. \n \nThe proposed state regulations deal with what happens when the farmer makes more electricity than is needed on the farm.\u00a0 Electric companies are not very eager to buy this electricity \u2013 which is a smaller amount, can be intermittent or unpredictable, and is more expensive than buying it from a big wind or solar farm.\u00a0 It also doesn\u2019t always \u201center the grid\u201d in the spot that electric companies would prefer.\u00a0 Because of these issues, electric companies would like to limit the amount of electricity that farmers can sell back.\u00a0 The proposed regulations would protect a farmer\u2019s ability to sell some of their extra electricity produced from these digesters. \n \nOne of our friends, John Williamson, an agriculture consultant with TeamAg in Ephrata is quoted in this article.\u00a0 TeamAg is a leader in the design and permitting of agricultural projects throughout the Northeastern United States. \n Aaron Marines \u00a0is an attorney at\u00a0 Russell, Krafft & Gruber, LLP , in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
