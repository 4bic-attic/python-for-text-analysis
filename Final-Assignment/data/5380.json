These are those we know about. We are blocking all the three directions \u2012 Kalanchak, Chaplynka and Chonhar (all in Kherson region, Ukraine) \u2012 as of noon sharp,\" he said at a meeting prior to the launch of the blockade, according to Ukrainian news agency RBC Ukraine. \n \nChubarov announced that the campaign would be held in three stages. \"A rally has begun. The rally is the first stage. There will be the second and third ones. As for duration and formats, we'll be in consultation with all those who have come here, with the headquarters and representatives of the Mejlis,\" he said. \n \nIn his words, the campaign will depend on many factors. \n \nChubarov also called on the Ukrainian Cabinet to address the issue of creating the so-called food hubs in Ukrainian territory close to the administrative border with occupied Crimea. In his words, this will allow entrepreneurs to work transparently, and money will remain in Ukraine, namely in Kherson region. \n \nAs was earlier reported, the blockade concerns only trucks with goods running between Ukraine and Crimea. Thus, all the four roads will be blocked not to let their movement. However, the campaign will not concern individuals and passenger cars, which will be able to move freely. \n \nThe leaders of the Crimean Tatars announced on September 8 that they would block the administrative border between mainland Ukraine and Crimea to prevent Ukrainian commodities from being delivered to the occupied peninsula. \n \n[embedded content]", "source": "UNIAN"}
