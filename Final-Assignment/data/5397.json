Most notably, it has continued to state its interest in Martinair, on either a partnership level or as a stakeholder, but had been rebuffed by Air France-KLM, which has said it wants to focus on internal issues at the moment. \n \n\u201cWe are looking at European carriers,\u201d said Mr Ilin. \u201cThere are some routes we are unable to operate, so we will ask Cargologicair if it will be able to instead.\u201d \n \nWhile the new airline is incorporated at Stansted, sources indicate that it is in talks to operate out of Manchester, from where it is expected to fly to the US, although this has not been confirmed. \n \nHowever, one air cargo executive questioned whether a transatlantic route would be financially viable. \n \n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t pay. I would expect to see flights to Africa perhaps. \n \n\u201cA UK AOC has good credibility and good traffic rights, but it\u2019s a bit pricey,\u201d he added. \n \nMr Ilin says that even once Cargologicair (CLA) is flying, it will take some time for it to develop a partnership with ABC, while ABC continues to be interested in another partnership. \n \n\u201cWe have a network from Amsterdam and we see mutual benefits with a Dutch national carrier which can fly to Africa and Latin America. Those routes are of interest, but the opportunities and traffic rights of ABC are limited.\u201d \n \nHe added, however, that even with limited rights, ABC \u201ccan\u2019t go everywhere. It\u2019s physically impossible.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut our existing network complements Martinair very well. It\u2019s a natural choice. If not Martinair, then CLA is a longer way to achieve this. But we need a partnership with a European-registered carrier.\u201d \n \nMr Ilin added: \u201cWe are open to partnerships with other airlines, and I\u2019ve said so publicly. But I can\u2019t get in touch with all of them. And it\u2019s not that urgent, it\u2019s just something we\u2019d like to look at.\u201d \n \nSee also, on People: Cargologicair recruitment drive under way as CEO and CCO join \n \nLater this week: more on ABC", "source": "Loadstar"}
