On top of her sporting achievements, she is also the public face of the campaign to speak out about depression and other mental illnesses. \n \nThe positive test came at the 1994 world cycling championships in Sicily where Hughes came in a disappointing fourth place in the time trial after finishing first in the event all year long. \n \nA few months after the world championships, Pierre Hutsebaut, Canada\u2019s national team director, called to break the news. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what ephedrine was,\u201d she said. \u201dI asked him what it was and he said, `it\u2019s a stimulant and it\u2019s found in cough medicine. Did you take any cough medicine or cold medication?\u2019 And I hadn\u2019t\u2026 \n \n\u201cYou can\u2019t take anything that\u2019s going to help you get over a cold or a lung infection or pain medication. You can\u2019t take that as an athlete.\u201d \n \nHughes said she has no idea how the ephedrine got in her sample, although she knows some scoff at that explanation. \n \nFor she once did the same when she heard athletes offer similar protests. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve also never been publicly outspoken about people who do test positive, because you never know,\u201d says Hughes, who now lives in Canmore, Alta. \n \nShe quietly served a three-month suspension during the off-season and said she was advised to keep her mouth shut. \n \nBehind her trademark smile, Hughes did just that until Sunday night, some 21 years after it all went down. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a big risk,\u201d she said, about going public. \u201cThis is not something I have to talk about. This could have been a secret to my grave, but I just felt that I couldn\u2019t not. \n \n\u201cPeople are going to judge me over this. There are people that are going to say that everything I did, I cheated. And I can\u2019t control that.\u201d \n \nOn Sunday night, Cycling Canada issued a statement saying Hughes contacting the organization in late August and warned of the revelation coming out in her book. \n \n\u201cCycling Canada cannot condone how this matter was handled at the time by any of those involved,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRegardless of the practices of the day, Cycling Canada believes in full, fair and open disclosure of all doping offences. We remain fully committed to the principles of fair play and rigid compliance with the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) code. \n \n\u201cCycling Canada is proud of its current role as a leader in the anti-doping movement and remains committed to learning from the mistakes of the past, so we don\u2019t make them again.\u201d \n \nHughes won two bronze in road cycling at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and captured four medals (one gold, one silver and two bronze) over the course of three Winter Olympics.", "source": "Cold Lake Sun"}
