It\u2019s not like, all of a sudden, hot. I mean, it was more on the warmer side, but it\u2019s not like impossible, to be quite honest. Really no excuse for that,\u201d said the 34-year-old. \n \n\u201cI think everybody should be well-prepared. I know we don\u2019t play many best-of-five-set matches all the time, so of course the body can react funny once you exceed the two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours of play. \n \n\u201cMaybe some guys already came in too tired, whatever it was. I think you have to analyze case by case. But I think other players should be so fit that heat really shouldn\u2019t matter at that point, the ones we\u2019ve been playing in.\u201d \n \nThe 22-year-old Sock was leading Belgium\u2019s Ruben Bemelmans 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 1-2 when he started cramping and was forced to retire. \n \nSock, the 28th seed, then collapsed on court, where he was treated with ice packs and cold towels by US Open medical staff before being carried off to the shade of the Grandstand Court. \n \nJust hours later, Istomin also called it quits on Court Seven against Austrian 20th seed Dominic Thiem, who was 6-4, 6-4, 1-0 up at the time. \n \nTwo women also retired in the first round, taking the total for this year\u2019s US Open to 14. \n \nThe carnage led again to suggestions that the men, who play the best of five sets, should be accorded the same protection as women players. \n \nThe WTA allows a 10-minute break between the second and third sets of women\u2019s matches when the mercury bursts through 30.1 degrees. \n \nThird seed Andy Murray, who battled through five sets to beat France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino on Thursday, believes there is scope for men to have a similar time-out. \n \n\u201cWhen it\u2019s extremely hot and humid, it helps to have that break,\u201d said Murray of the 10-minute rest that women players take between the second and third sets when the temperature goes above 30.1 degrees. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s for. But I guess you get the chance to sort of go off and change, get under a cold shower if you want to.\u201d \n \nThis entry passed through the Full-Text RSS service \u2013 if this is your content and you\u2019re reading it on someone else\u2019s site, please read the FAQ at fivefilters.org/content-only/faq.php#publishers. \n \nSource:: 24 sport", "source": "The World 247.com"}
