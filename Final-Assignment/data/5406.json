The desire to tell your own story, direct and write or star in it (or sometimes take on all of those roles) is a attractive lure, and can turn out very well. But as Ryan Gosling learned at Cannes earlier this year with \u201c Lost River ,\u201d ambition, if not matched by execution, can come at a steep critical cost. So credit to Chris Evans for keeping his goals modest with his directorial debut \u201c Before We Go ,\u201d but unfortunately he can\u2019t clear the low bar he sets for himself with this strained romantic drama that struggles desperately to be engaging, charming or relatable.  \n \nREAD MORE:\u00a0Chris Evans On His Directorial Debut \u2018Before We Go,\u2019 Filming In New York, & \u2018Avengers: Age Of Ultron\u2019 \n \n\n  \nThings kick off with a pretty decent meet cute: in a rush to grab the last train to Boston from Grand Central Station, Brooke ( Alice Eve ) drops and breaks her cell in front of busking jazz musician Nick (Chris Evans). She\u2019s already gone before he can flag her down, but he gets another shot to return her mobile when, having missed the train, she comes back to the main terminal. It\u2019s very late, and with the doors being closed for the night, both are forced outside. Sensing that she\u2019s a bit adrift, Nick\u00a0becomes the Captain America of chivalry, and upon learning her purse was stolen, which included her wallet and credit cards, he\u2019s determined to help her get home. And so follows one night in Manhattan, with Brooke and Nick becoming drawn to each other, while harboring secret pains from their past, that will start being healed over the next few hours together. \n \nEvans clearly aspires to make a breezy and relatable, Richard Linklater -esque walk-and-talk movie, but lacks the skills to make it feel natural. The script for the 89-minute film is somehow credited to four different writers ( Ron Bass, Jen Smolka, Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair ) which might explain why the film feels so clumsy and leaden as it\u00a0contrives to keep the more sensible solutions to get Brooke to Boston out of reach. Not only are her resources gone, but conveniently, Nick\u2019s cell phone has just run out of power, one credit card is overdrawn, the other is expired, and he\u2019s got a limited amount of cash in his wallet. But one thing he does have in spades is resourcefulness. \n \n\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d Nick says a handful of times in the film. Eager to avoid a wedding reception where he\u2019ll face an ex-girlfriend that\u2019s still the love of his life, and with Brooke on a ticking clock to get back to Boston by 7 AM before her husband returns from a business trip at 8 AM (for reasons revealed later), Nick openly says he wants to be a hero and does everything he can, within his meagre means, to make that happen. But it really leads to a series of not very amusing or appealing misadventures, designed to force Nick and Brooke to face the problems they are trying to put behind them or ignore, while also realizing the future may lie with each other. \n \n\u201c Before Sunrise \u201d is an obvious touchstone and influence on \u201cBefore We Go,\u201d right down to a running device involving pretend phone calls (except Nick and Brooke call their past selves), but it severely lacks that film\u2019s heart and soul. What made Linklater\u2019s film(s) work so well, and the characters feel so real, was that we learned everything about them. Celine and Jesse\u2019s journey through Vienna was partially about escaping their respective breakups, but their discussions centered on all the things people connect over\u2014love, life, religion, philosophy\u2014and made them complex, compelling people you wanted to spend time with and know more about. By contrast, Brooke and Nick are not even half as interesting. \u201cBefore We Go\u201d is like going on a date with someone who only talks about their ex; indeed, much of Brooke and Nick\u2019s time together is spent focused on people who have hurt them, so when we\u2019re supposed to believe during the third act that they are being drawn to each other, it\u2019s a bit mysterious why they find each other interesting, beyond having a mutual shoulder to cry on. Their passions, motivations, dreams and thoughts never surface to help suggest why there is something more to their brief nighttime odyssey. \n \n\n \nREAD MORE:\u00a0Berlin Interview: Richard Linklater Talks Making \u2018Before Midnight\u2019 & The 14-Minute-Long Shot \n \nBut one thing they do talk about a lot is love and fate, fighting for love and finding love. And it\u2019s here where the movie, without spoiling anything, is curiously old-fashioned. Brooke in particular comes to a conclusion about what she needs to do about her marriage that is not the empowering or romantic notion the screenwriters might think it is, but that may also be because the details of what\u2019s happening between her and her husband are also both clich\u00e9 and underdeveloped.\u00a0 \n \nMeanwhile, when the script isn\u2019t working, Evans turns towards the soundtrack and leans on indie rock when he can (and when the low-budget picture can afford it) to attempt to do some of the emotional lifting. But when those cuts includes overused or outdated choices like \u201cSong For Zula\u201d by Phosphorescent (see also \u201c The Amazing Spider-Man 2 \u201d and \u201c The Spectacular Now \u201c) and Bloc Party \u2018s \u201cSo Here We Are\u201d (used on \u201c One Tree Hill \u201d twice, Katherine Heigl \u2018s \u201c 27 Dresses \u201c), not to mention a closing credit song by omnipresent soundtrack emotional shorthand Bon Iver . And it\u2019s even more frustrating because the snatches of score by Chris Westlake , when used, are actually quite good and more effective than the safe indie rock selections. \n \n\n  \nThe final indignity committed by \u201cBefore We Go\u201d is setting a movie in Manhattan that looks like it could\u2019ve taken place anywhere. For a city that is alive late at night like no other, and offers endless possibilities for unique places for these characters to go, the screenwriters and Evans (perhaps due to budgetary reasons) keep most of the action on anonymous streets, and even less familiar bars (though hey, Cup And Saucer). We\u2019re not sure who was doing the second unit work, but someone should\u2019ve provided them with a tripod as the shots of the New York City skyline look mistakenly shaky, and we\u2019re pretty certain it had nothing to do with the digital projection. \n \nIf there is anything Chris Evans can take away from \u201cBefore We Go,\u201d it would be to treat the film as a tremendous learning experience. Making a good film requires more than simply aping the structure and superficial qualities of better movies, and that there is much to be learned by digging deeper into the technical and emotional mechanics of what makes them work. Otherwise, you end up with an effort like this: a movie so firmly convinced it has all the moving parts, it never investigates whether they work well together. While Nick and Brooke might walk away from the evening wondering if those few hours together stoked something that\u2019s real, for the audience, those 89 minutes will feel like an eternity that they\u2019ll be ready to be divorced from.
