This time around it comes in the form of Double Chocolate Chip Caramel Cookies!\nThomas and I are heading to Germany in a week! It will be his first time to Europe and I\u2019m pumped to bring him back to my kinda-sorta home! We spent a decent amount of time in Germany growing up because that\u2019s where my family is from. We\u2019ll be running around Southern Germany for 10 days but before we get there we have a loooooooong flight. In order to make it through without losing our minds, I\u2019ll be bringing Double Chocolate Chip Caramel Cookies. It\u2019s a take on my favorite trail mix which combines almonds, chocolate and little chocolate covered caramels \u2013 but I\u2019ve turned them into cookies because it\u2019s the right thing to do! Made with chocolate chips, chopped up caramels and Oven Roasted Sea Salt Blue Diamond Almonds and then dusted with Maldon sea salt for an extra punch of flavor \u2013 these really can\u2019t be beat!\nPrint\nDouble Chocolate Chip Caramel Cookies\nIngredients2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1/2 cup cocoa powder1 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup butter, softened1 cup packed brown sugar3/4 cup granulated sugar1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 large eggs1 \u00bd cup dark chocolate chocolate chips\u00bd cup caramel bites1/2 cup Oven Roasted Sea Salt Blue Diamond Almonds, choppedMaldon salt for dusting\nInstructionsPreheat oven to 375\u00b0 F.Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.
