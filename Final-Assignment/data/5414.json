Photo: Dilip Khatri \n \nKHOTANG: The number of patients suffering from scrub typhus, diarrhoea, pneumonia, typhoid and cold among others have rose to extremity in the Khotang District Hospital. \n \nThe number of patients heavily outnumbers the only 15 beds of the hospital. The newly arrived patients undergo treatment on floor without any other option in lack of beds in the hospital, informed Dr Madhav Prasad Lamsal. \n \nThe hospital was established in 1991. The lack of beds in the hospital has forced some patients to undergo treatment staying in nearby hotels. The growth of number of patients has also pressurised in the outpatient department. The patients have to wait for their turn until the previous patients return home after treatment, Lamsal added. \n \nThere is also scarcity of medicines since the East Regional Health Directorate, Biratnagar has been unable to supply the medicine due to the disturbance caused by ongoing protests in Tarai-Madhes. \n \nPatients undergoing treatment on floor in the shortage of beds in the District Hospital, Khotang on Monday, September 21, 2015.
