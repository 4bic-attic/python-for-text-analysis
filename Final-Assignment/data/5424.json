However at no time in her reply does she mention the computer software problem that causes many problems for those tenants that find themselves in arrears.\u00a0 \n \nAs this computer software problem has been going on for seven years I find it hard to understand why she does not admit this or deny this. If she is not aware of this problem then she should be; if she is aware of the problem and is refusing to comment on it, then I question her position as cabinet member.\u00a0 \n \nI am sure your readers would still like to hear her comments about the computer software problem ( Eviction not necessary, Letters , August 27 ) and what the council are doing about it. \n \nI have no doubt that housing officers offer benefits advice support and repayment plans once the arrears have been highlighted. However, the arrears on not being picked up within the two-week period as they should be and this is a serious issue for the tenants and the council alike. \n \nPlease come clean Cllr Callaghan and tell us if you knew or not about the computer software issue and the fact that housing officers do not contact tenants as quickly as they should about arrears. \n \nDF GOWERS, NW8", "source": "Camden New Journal"}
