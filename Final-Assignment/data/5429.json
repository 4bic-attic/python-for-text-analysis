'We are confident the 737-800BCF-with its more advanced avionics, better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs-will provide the airline with a competitive advantage in the marketplace.' \n \nThe 737-800 will be the first Next-Generation 737 that Boeing offers for conversion. Through its 737 freighter conversion program, Boeing will support customers in the narrow-body freighter market, a segment of the freighter market growing quickly around the world. \n \nYTO Airlines is a Hangzhou-based Chinese express cargo carrier backed by Shanghai YTO Express Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. The carrier currently operates a fleet of Boeing 737-300F airplanes, providing domestic and international air cargo services. \n \n### \n \n Contact: \nCynthia Reynaud \nCommercial Aviation Services Communications \n206-661-2632 \n \ncynthia.l.reynaud@boeing.com", "source": "4 Traders"}
