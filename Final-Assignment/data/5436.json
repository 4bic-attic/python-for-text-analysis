(Tao Te Ching) In life we feel often feel insecure and uncertain about how our day is going to unfold.\u00a0Every morning we wake up with a different mood, different thoughts, and worry about the challenges that we are about to face that day. But then, often\u00a0the issues that worry us in the morning disappear as the day goes on.\u00a0As we keep observing, we discover that the biggest trouble makers is really our mind, painting scary scenarios, and getting us worry about it. But if, on the other hand, we just let life happen as it does, things resolve by themselves. Emotions rise and the fall, thoughts come and the go;\u00a0we just observe them like an outsider while life happens.\nAs we watch this movie over and over again, we become centered and stable.\u00a0We allow and observe whatever life brings to us moment by moment.\u00a0We experience, observe, and accept every moment that comes with clarity and openness.\u00a0We are simply present as life unfolds.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes we are indifferent to what is happening; sometimes we get involved and run with it. Whatever we may end up doing,\u00a0it is all good as long as the observer in us is doing his job.\u00a0\nWe have a choice. We can be here with the mission\u00a0to achieve something and become someone. But that brings pressures, disappointments, and sometimes, renders us ineffective. We can also be here just to learn, to experience and to discover who we truly are. When we do that,\u00a0life becomes light, full of fun, and filled with possibilities! Will you join us?
