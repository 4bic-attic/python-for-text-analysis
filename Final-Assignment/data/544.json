So in this proposed ad for a brand of butter, a couple would be preparing food in their kitchen when one of them drops something on the floor, and the other one says: \u201cMargarine fingers.\u201d Then the person who dropped the thing looks back at their partner and makes a \u2018yuck\u2019 expression, indicating that \u201cmargarine fingers\u201d does not sound at all appetizing. Then they decide together to use butter in the dish they are preparing rather than margarine. Then the announcer says: \u201cThere\u2019s just no substitute for (whatever brand of) real butter.\u201d", "source": "unconditioned response"}
