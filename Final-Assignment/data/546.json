James Lewis, board chairman, said in explaining why he voted against the plan.\n\nBoard member Anthony Diina, the only vote in favor, said he supported the project, given the unusual shape of the lot and the failure of the existing zoning for the property. He referred to disparaging comments made by opponents of the store as \u201coutrageous\u201d and also was critical of those who criticized a community organization that supported the project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the Zoning Board of Appeals capitulated to community opposition of a vocal minority,\u201d said attorney Corey A. Auerbach, representing Family Dollar.\n\nThe board was being asked to approve zoning variances addressing issues including signage, parking, building size and front and side yard placement. Auerbach argued that any new construction on the irregularly shaped site would face similar zoning issues.\n\nOpposition to the Family Dollar plan, nonetheless, was strong and vocal.\n\nSome 18 people lined up in the boardroom Wednesday to speak against the plan. Among them were John A. Ciminelli, of LPCiminelli, whose company is in the process of redeveloping the nearby Central Park Plaza into a $70 million apartment complex.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit here,\u201d Ciminelli said of the store, arguing that it goes against the city\u2019s efforts to promote a Green Code and transit-friendly development. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to walk out of the subway station and see this,\u201d he said.\n\nAssemblywoman Crystal D. Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, also spoke against the proposal.\n\n\u201cI represent both sides of Main Street,\u201d the assemblywoman told the board. \u201cWhat is proposed is not something people want.\u201d\n\n\u201cMasten constituents do not want this,\u201d Common Council Member Ulysees O. Wingo of the Masten District.\n\nAmber Small, executive director of Parkside Community Association, also opposed the plan. The zoning changes requested are severe, she said.\n\nMelissa Brown, of FLARE Community Center on nearby Leroy Avenue, said that the group distributed surveys and that only 46 people opposed the project. About 3,000 residents live in the immediate area, she said. She didn\u2019t have the surveys with her, but offered to provide them in the future. Wednesday, however, was the last of several Zoning Board meetings on the issue.\n\nPreviously, FLARE had been accused of supporting the project only after the developer offered a $100,000 donation. FLARE denied the accusation.\n\nemail: sschulman@buffnews.com", "source": "Buffalo News"}
