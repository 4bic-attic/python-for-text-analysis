She was known for nearly three months as Baby Doe as investigators worked to learn her identity. \n\nHer mother, Rachelle Bond, 40, is charged with being an accessory after the fact to Bella's death. Bond's boyfriend, Michael McCarthy, 35, is charged with murder for allegedly punching the girl in the abdomen until she stopped breathing. \n\nBella's body was then kept in a refrigerator for some time before being placed on Deer Island. \n\nDCF said the agency had been involved with the girl twice when she was an infant - in 2012 and 2013 - providing neglect-related support. The cases were then closed.", "source": "WMTW"}
