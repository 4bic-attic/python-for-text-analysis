Competition in the current account market is hotting up with more banks like Halifax, TSB and Clydesdale bringing in switching incentives, and lots of accounts on the market still offering high interest on balances.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nWhile the increased fees mean that fewer customers will benefit from having a 123 product, they will still prove attractive to many - specifically those with a lot of savings. \n \nBy making use of the full \u00a320,000 allowance on the current account for example, customers would be able to earn \u00a3600 interest a year before tax.", "source": "This is Local London"}
