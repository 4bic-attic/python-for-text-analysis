We are planning a 6 day visit early Nov. DH and I have never been, and we are looking for any and all suggestions, to make for a memorable trip. We do have points for the Marriott, is it a good location, or are other hotels worth spending for? Day trips? Not to miss restaurants? TIA~", "source": "Community"}
