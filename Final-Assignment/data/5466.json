Whether someone performs comedy, magic, or does speaking engagements, Empower Sound provides a solution. The Empower Sound line includes, but is not limited to: all in one portable PA systems; wireless microphones; speakers; special music players with secret remote controls; and numerous accessories that are great for performers of all skill levels.\n\n\u201cAs a performer, I know a little about all that can go right, but even more about what can go wrong when you are standing in front of a crowd. I decided to make the Empower Sound line based on the experiences I have had and the need to control all aspects of the performance myself.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Happie Amp/Amazing Amp, Jr. Pro, and UHF Pro, Foshee will be releasing his newest product soon. The newest product is the cutting edge, Empower Sound Ultimate Control BT. It combines an Mp3 player with secret remote control and Bluetooth connectivity. This device will have techies raving because of its iPhone/iPad/Android app capability. It will also be battery powered for use anywhere.\n\nFoshee says, \u201cPerformers everywhere should know Empower Sound has their back. The MP3 player is just another example of me bringing control back to the performer so they do not have to worry as much about unexpected, technical difficulties. I am sure it will be magical, pardon the pun.\u201d\n\nThe Empower Sound products are equally as interesting and creative as their inventor.
