Kubrick\u2019s ubiquitous\u00a0adaptation has just about been done to death, but Hodge\u2019s solution is a solid one that manages on its own right to stand on its own, creating a simple-yet-effective maze that calls out one of the film\u2019s most popular elements and also the tension between its characters. \n \nThis is available for pre-order now, but quantities are extremely limited.
