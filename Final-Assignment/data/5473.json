He calls much of his rock balancing \u201cGravity Glue,\u201d but the only adhesive he uses is literally gravity with any three contact points found on any given rock. \n\u201cLuckily, every rock is covered in a variety of tiny to large indentations that can act as a natural tripod for the rock to stand upright, or in most orientations you can think of, with other rocks,\u201d he says. \n\nGrab \u2014 who is from Edmonton, Canada, but lives in Boulder, Colorado \u2014 began balancing in 2008 \u201con a whim,\u201d but it soon because a passion that he practices every day. \n\n\u201cI quickly noticed the unique effect that my creations had on myself and others, often inspiring a sense of magic and peace; a sense that anything is possible,\u201d Grab says. \n\nThe artist now travels around the world to give demonstrations of his perfectly balanced creations.
