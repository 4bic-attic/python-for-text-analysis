[ID:nL4N11G3IE] \n \nIndeed, one of the ECB's top measures of long-term inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year euro zone breakeven forward has fallen to below 1.7 percent, short of the ECB's inflation target of just under 2 percent. \n \nPointing to uncertainties, Constancio said much depended on  the United States and China. \n \n\"We need a strong recovery in the U.S.,\" Constancio said. \"China can still stabilise its situation and to keep growth above 6 percent is achievable in the short term.\" \n \nChina cranked up fiscal spending by 26 percent in August compared to a year earlier as recent data provided further evidence that world's second-largest economy continues to lose momentum. [ID:nL4N11L12I] \n \nConstancio also urged Europe to accept immigrants to keep its workforce from shrinking further, saying it needed more workers to boost economic growth. [ID:nL5N11L0UF] \n \nGREECE \n \nAlthough the Greek crisis shook confidence in the euro area, Constancio said ejecting Athens from the currency was \"never for real\" because it would not be legal and Europe now has to erase any lingering doubts about the bloc's viability. \n \nThe new Greek government, due to take office after elections this month, must commit to the 85 billion euro bailout deal and if the programme stays on course, the easing of capital controls may not be far off. \n \n\"The stage is set for a gradual dismantling of the capital controls,\" Constancio said. \"They will be eliminated as they were in Cyprus.\" \n \nHe added Greek debt should not be viewed in simple ratios and he expects views, including those of the International Monetary Fund, to converge when debt sustainability is discussed in the first review. \n \n\"A haircut has been refused by the member states and I certainly hope it will not be necessary in view of the numbers,\" Constancio added. \"The more one digs into the numbers, the more that sort of conclusion seems to emerge.\" \n \n(Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "source": "Yahoo!
