His fandom of a billion or so people evidently includes Madonna , who dedicated a performance of \"La Vie en Rose\" to the pontiff on Thursday night at a concert in Philadelphia. (The Pope will visit the City of Brotherly Love this weekend.) People posted a video of it. \"He seems very open-minded, right?\" she asked the crowd. It's not totally clear whether that admiration goes both ways: As she admitted, she's ticked off the Catholic Church on at least three separate occasions, leading a number of high-ranking Catholics to call for her ex-communication. Sean Penn sues Lee Daniels for $10 million for comparing him to Terrence Howard But it's NBD as far as she's concerned. \"It shows the Vatican cares. Deeply,\" she joked. \"Since the Pope -- Popey-Wopey -- is on his way over here, I will dedicate this song to him,\" she continued. \"Because it's a love song, and I firmly believe that love does make the world go 'round.\" Then: \"Honestly, I don't think there's that much difference between me and the Pope.\" Well. She also thinks there's not much difference between her and MLK , Nelson Mandela , and Kanye , so the Pope isn't too much of a reach. People also reported Madonna teased the Pope was \"stalking\" her, since he's been making the rounds to the same East Coast cities where she's been performing her Rebel Heart Tour. \"Either he's a copycat or he's secretly in love with me,\" she said.
