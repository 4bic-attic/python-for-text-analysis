India, government sources said, will now be looking to tie up the details with Wickremesinghe's \"national unity government\" and work towards finalising the agreement. \n \nWickremesinghe has also spoken in favour of a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar on Sri Lanka's western coast. More than the Sethusamudram project, which has now been almost given up, the idea of a land bridge has supporters in the Modi government. \n \nThe Sri Lankan PM is likely to have a lunch meeting with his counterpart Narendra Modi on September 15, aside from meetings with others in India's political leadership the same day. \n \nindianexpress.com\u00a0", "source": "Sri Lanka Daily News"}
