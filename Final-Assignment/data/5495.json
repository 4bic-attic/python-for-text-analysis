Bernstein, Anti-Defamation League New York Regional Director said in a statement Friday. \n\nThe Pace Chronicle is reporting that the photo in question was reportedly released to the media by a group of African-American students. The group of students said in an email to the Chronicle that they received the picture in real time via Snapchat this past week after there were rumors the photo was three years old. \n\nThe Chronicle is reporting that Owens' ex-girlfriend has denied leaking the photo. \n\n\"I would never do something like this to [Owens] or his team,\" she said to the Chronicle. \"I would never sabotage anyone's future or their team this way. I had nothing to do with it and from what the news is saying the picture was taken a couple of years ago, when I did not know Owens.\" \n\nAccording to the Chronicle, his ex-girlfriend did however decline to answer if Owens had displayed any racist or anti-Semitic tendencies during their relationship. \n\nCBS New York reports that Pace University removed Owens\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
