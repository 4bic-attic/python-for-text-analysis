INPHO \n\r\n\tPJ O'Mullan Jnr has put forward reasons why Antrim should make him their next hurling manager. \n \n\r\n\tO'Mullan has made no secret of his desire to take over the Saffrons. His decision to step down as Loughgiel Shamrocks manager in the wake of last Sunday's Antrim SHC semi-final re-fixture defeat to Cushendall means he's available and ready, though he could face competition for the job from Dunloy boss Gregory O'Kane and Westmeath coach Michael Walsh. \n \n\r\n\t\"I feel I know what it takes,\" O'Mullan is quoted in the Irish News. \n \n\r\n\t\"I would give it everything I had for a few years. I know what the financial implications are in taking teams down south. I know the players. I know every club team. I've seen every championship game. \n \n\r\n\t\"At the end of the day, I'm an Antrim man and I think Antrim people should be running Antrim hurling. But if the county board want to try someone else, I'll walk away from it.\" \n Tweet", "source": "Hoganstand.com"}
