He stressed the need for following the mandate of the constitution in letter and spirit as laid down by the apex court to overcome this problem. \n\nThe attorney general said the government had submitted a bill to parliament for reforming the civil justice system which also aimed at discouraging frivolous litigations. He regretted that despite stressing the importance of fundamental rights of access to justice, \u201cwe are still struggling to enforce it for the benefit of the common man\u201d. \n\nPakistan Bar Council\u2019s Vice Chairman Azam Nazeer Tarar said the Supreme Court was a seat of justice, but not a seat of power. The resolution of delicate political issues is not the domain of the apex court even if a constitutional garb allows it. \n\nThe judgments by the court, he said, must be based on strong legal foundations and address grievances or violations of rights, adding that a number of sound judgments might be unpopular but they were judged as upright, while others were sadly perceived to be populist and pandering to personal desires of judges. \n\nEthnic and linguistic rights are among the most delicate political issues in the country and cannot be resolved with the stroke of a pen but through a political consensus. \n\nReferring to the upholding of military courts set up under the 21st Amendment, Mr Tarar expressed scepticism over the logic that there were basic features of the constitution, including the fundamental rights, but at the same time these fundamental rights were not offended by the trials of civilians in the military courts. \n\nHe said the holding of courts till late evening would not end the backlog of cases and denying lawyers their legitimate need to take off during vacations would not add to efficiency. \n\nThe Supreme Court Bar Association president urged the chief justice to consider and rectify what he called horrible effects of the July 31, 2009, judgment whereby more than 100 judges had been removed against the norms of the constitution. \n\nPublished in Dawn, September 15th, 2015 \n\nOn a mobile phone?
