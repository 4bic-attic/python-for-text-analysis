[But] I'm gonna say I would pick Adam because he's married to a supermodel. Need I say more?'' \n\nThe country music star admitted Adam, 36, might be surprised by his choice, but jokingly told PEOPLE.com: ''I don't give a f**k. That's who I'm picking and it's because of his wife. Period.'' \n\nBlake has formed a close bond with Adam, who married Victoria's Secret beauty Behati in Mexico last year, since meeting on the NBC singing competition nine seasons ago and is impressed by his work ethic. \n\nThe 39-year-old star said: ''Adam and I, believe it or not, spent time together a lot, mostly just talking. As much as we work two seasons on this show, he's right in there working. As soon as there's a break, he's got a whole band waiting for him to get back on the road. The guy really doesn't get much of a break. \n\n''My favourite part of being on this show is those friendships that I've made.''", "source": "TVGuide.co.uk"}
