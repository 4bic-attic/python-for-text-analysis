Love it or hate it, an event as big as the RWC sends brands into a frenzy of activity - official and unofficial sponsors fighting for fans attention and more importantly, their dollars. But which ones are on track to lift the trophy once the final whistle has blown?\nTake your Heineken's of the world, your Emirates' and such; simply being an official sponsor is enough. They pay millions so they don't have to get dirty in the scrum - they pay millions to have their name associated with the tournament by default. Heineken in particular are reported to have invested nearly half of its master brands budget this year solely on their sponsorship deal. That's big money, and a decision that wouldn't have been made lightly.", "source": "Campaign Brief Asia"}
