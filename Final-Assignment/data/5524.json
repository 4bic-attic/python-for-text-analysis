Instead of describing the effect of repealing the law or letting it stand, the We Decide Coalition simply cut and pasted SB483\u2019s title.\n\nThe suit points out that Nevada law \u201crequires that an initiative petition set forth, in not more than 200 words, a \u2018description of the effect of the initiative or referendum if the initiative or referendum is approved by the voters.\u2019 The purpose of the description of effect is to help prevent voter confusion and promote informed decisions. The description of effect cannot be materially misleading, nor fail to identify the consequences of a referendum\u2019s passage, and it must be straightforward, succinct, and nonargumentative.\u201d\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"200\"] Chuck Muth[/caption]\n\nOne of the instigators of the petition, Chuck Muth, conceded the latter point and said the group plans to refile its petition with a new and improved description of effect.\n\nOnce that is done, the other coalition is expected to file suit against that petition and start the whole process over again.\n\nThere is a possibility somewhere along the line that someone might raise the issue of whether every state judge has a conflict of interest. Were the voters to get a chance to slash the state budget by nearly 17 percent, who knows where the cuts in spending might trickle down. To the courts, perhaps? But it is hard to see how federal courts could have jurisdiction in what are basically conflicts under state law and constitution.\n\nGov. Brian Sandoval has promised to fight the repeal effort tooth and nail, calling the petition \u201ca wrongheaded attack on the children and families of Nevada. Supported by more than seventy percent of legislators, the revenue the petition seeks to eliminate will go directly to the classroom and give teachers the resources to deliver a quality education.\u201d\n\nOf course, the governor fails to note that the state has increased education spending 80 percent per pupil, adjusted for inflation, over the past 40 years with no detectible effect on student test scores.\n\nMore than a few legal knots will have to be untangled before we find out whether the voters themselves will get a chance to say whether they agree or not with this massive increase in spending and taxation.\n\nA version of this column appears this week in the Battle Born Media newspapers \u2014\u00a0The Ely Times, the\u00a0Mesquite Local News, the\u00a0Mineral County Independent-News, the\u00a0Eureka Sentinel,\u00a0the\u00a0Lincoln County Record\u00a0and the Sparks Tribune \u2014 and the\u00a0Elko Daily Free Press.", "source": "4TH ST8"}
