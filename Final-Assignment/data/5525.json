DeAndra Yates\u2019s 13-year-old son was shot in the head by a stray bullet while attending a friend\u2019s birthday party in Indiana, left unable to speak or walk. The Rev. Sharon Risher lost her mother and two cousins in June\u2019s Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Most recently, Andy Parker\u2019s daughter, Alison, was one of two people fatally shot outside Roanoke, Virginia, during a live television newscast. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI come here in a state of raw and consuming grief,\u201d said Parker, who has become a prominent gun-control activist in the weeks since his 24-year-old daughter\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m not here because I want to be here; I am here because I have to be here.\u201d \n\u00a0 \u00a0 The hundreds of activists at Thursday\u2019s \u201cWhatever it Takes\u201d rally \u2014 named after Parker\u2019s mantra proclaiming that he will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to stop gun violence \u2014 did not call on Congress to pass sweeping gun reform laws, but narrowly lobbied for legislation that would mandate stricter background checks. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., unsuccessfully pushed for such legislation in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting. After high-profile shootings this past summer, there is renewed interest among gun-control advocates to revive that legislation. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Virginia Democratic Sens. Timothy Kaine and Mark Warner and Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe spoke at the rally, which was organized by Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization working to end gun violence formerly known as Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Most in attendance wore red shirts with the words \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d some donning ribbons honoring the victims of shootings at Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing contradictory between background checks and the Second Amendment,\u201d Warner said. \u201cWe can take the next step on background checks \u2014 not next year, but this year.\u201d \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Kaine, who was governor of Virginia when a gunman fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech, introduced legislation Tuesday that would hold gun dealers accountable for selling weapons to people who are barred from owning them. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cWe have got to act. The way you don\u2019t let grief turn into despair is to act.\u201d \n\u00a0 \u00a0 The gun-control movement might have Virginia\u2019s top Democrats on its side, but pushing gun-related legislation through Congress won\u2019t be easy. When the Manchin-Toomey legislation failed, Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans now have control of both chambers, making the odds of legislative success that much slimmer. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 On Thursday, activists called out Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., whose district includes the Roanoke area where Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot, for not giving more attention to gun-violence measures. Goodlatte chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which controls legislation pertaining to guns. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI will meet with anyone, anytime, any place,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo Rep. Goodlatte, I am waiting for your call. But I am here to say, if you are not in favor of background checks, we\u2019ll find someone who is.\u201d \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Goodlatte\u2019s office said Thursday afternoon that the two are scheduled to meet Friday. Goodlatte wouldn\u2019t say whether he is in favor of expanded background checks, adding that there are laws in place that aren\u2019t being enforced. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI look forward to speaking again tomorrow with Mr. Parker and looking for additional ways to reduce gun violence, while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens,\u201d Goodlatte wrote in an email. \u201cAt the same time, as I have previously pointed out to the administration, many of our nation\u2019s gun laws are not enforced, and the Obama administration should take immediate steps to fully enforce the gun laws already on the books.\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Colin Goddard, who survived four gunshot wounds at Virginia Tech and is now a senior policy advocate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said he wishes people like Richard Martinez and Andy Parker never had to bury their children to become spokesmen for the cause. He said he hopes a shift in popular opinion can lead to incremental changes in the law. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI wish none of these people were here. I wish I didn\u2019t know Andy Parker,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that I do, let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "source": "Reporters365"}
