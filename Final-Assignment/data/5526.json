Don\u2019t look around\nFor someone else to be found\u2026\nAnd birds sing their long song\nFor you, too, in sky so blue;\nYes, you! And none too few,\nAs flowers bloom in radiant plume\nOf flashing colors, dashing\nIn beauty for you, too; every hue\nTo say something new and true\u2026\nIn new-fallen snow, you should know\nEvery particle glistens and listens\nTo you; yes, you! And makes haste\nTo waste no moment to bring smile\nTo your face from across the miles,\nAnd ease your trials on earth,\nTo bring new birth and joyous mirth\nInto your days without any haze\nOf doom and gloom \u2026 Yes, for you!
