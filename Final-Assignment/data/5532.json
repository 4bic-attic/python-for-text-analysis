Duke said: \u201cI don\u2019t think our chances are looking too good at the minute. We\u2019ve definitely been handed the toughest draw in the competition. \n\n\u201cOur recent form is okay and we beat New Zealand during the Rugby Championship (which Australia won), but we don\u2019t have the best recent record against England.\u201d \n\nCheika made waves last month when he named his squad for the World Cup, leaving several big names at home. \n\nFormer captain James Horwill missed out on selection, as did Scott Higginbotham, Christian Lealiifano and Nick Cummins. \n\nAnd Duke believes Cheika has made a mistake in leaving such experienced players out as they look to win the sport\u2019s biggest prize. \u201cI\u2019m worried one or two of the less experienced players might be overawed by the occasion whereas those with experience wouldn\u2019t be\u201d added Duke. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time and place to be experimental with a line-up and the tournament itself is definitely not the right time to do it.\u201d \n\nDespite Duke\u2019s concerns about the team\u2019s experience, or rather their lack of it, Australia do appear to have arrived with one of the most exciting back divisions in the tournament. \n\nMercurial could be a term used to describe both Quade Cooper and Kurtley Beale, while Israel Folau is regarded as one of the best fullbacks currently playing the game. \n\nAnd Duke is hoping the trio can help fire the Wallabies to glory over the next six weeks. \n\n\u201cCooper is a gun. He\u2019s probably the most talented player we have got, but politics have played a role in his international career and he gets a tough time in the press back home,\u201d he added. \n\n\u201cBeale has also had a tough time over the years, but if he is ever going to fulfill his potential, then now is the time to do it. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some good backs and Folau is brilliant to watch. I just wish I had some tickets! I\u2019ll just have to go down the pub and watch it with mates there.\u201d \n\nDuke\u2019s UCS Old Boys team have a mix of nationalities, meaning it should be a fun time for all at the club throughout the tournament. \n\nAnd Duke hopes Australia do well, if only to help him avoid being the butt of the jokes. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll cop some flak, but I\u2019ll be sure to dish it back if we do well!\u201d he laughed.", "source": "Kilburn Times"}
