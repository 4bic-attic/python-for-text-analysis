Canberra golfer Matthew Millar says the \"kick up the backside\" of being forced to win back his tour card is behind his hot form after taking a share of second at the New Caledonia Open. Millar shot a six-under 65 in the first round on Wednesday to sit one shot behind Victorian Daniel Valente.\n\nThe Gold Creek professional has registered five top 10 finishes in six starts this year, including his maiden Australasian Tour victory at the New Zealand PGA.\n\nMillar kept his playing rights by negotiating qualifying school, and isn't taking his second chance for granted.\n\n\"I guess I had a couple of light bulb moments over the time off and having to go to Q-School was a good kick up the backside,\" he said.\n\n\"I have just come out and believed more in the way I play and not worried about the way other people play.\n\n\"I putted really well. I had been putting pretty ordinary the last few weeks which isn't usually my thing.\n\n\"This is a golf course where you need to putt well and I certainly bounced back well.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "source": "St Marys Star"}
