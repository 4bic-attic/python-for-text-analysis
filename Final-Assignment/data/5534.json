The parties are restricted by elections rules which only allow them to commit to space over a specific time frame, a few days after and before an election. \n\nDespite the limited timeframe of these transactions, the election leases do aid landlords\u2019 bottom line, at least temporarily. \n\n\u201cThe longer election did help in terms of locking someone in and in the meantime we can look for a more permanent tenant,\u201d said Philip Traikos, a senior vice-president at brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, adding these types of temporary deals are usually for only about 50 per cent of the going rate in a given area.\r \n\nAre you looking to invest in property?
