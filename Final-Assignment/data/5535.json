His wife Nagmeh, who lives in the U.S. with their two young children, is calling for Christians worldwide to join her in a prayer vigil at noon on September 26\u2014the third anniversary of his imprisonment. Pastor Saeed has been repeatedly beaten and denied medical care, yet he continues to be a beacon for the Gospel among his fellow prisoners. Please pray for his health and that he will be released soon. Please remember Pastor Saeed, his family, and persecuted believers around the globe. We can be assured that our God hears the prayers of His people: \u201cNow this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us\u201d (1 John 5:14).", "source": "Share Prayer Request & Praise Reports"}
