We are on a great track and can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u00a0I\u2019m proud of what the council has accomplished over the past four years,\u201d Price said. \u201cWith two young kids growing up in front of my eyes, I need to step back and give them as much of my time as I can.\u201d \n\nPrice is the second council member to announce he will not seek another term, with at-large representative Noreen Otto also leaving her seat open. \n\nCouncil Member Craig Trotter, who represents the third ward, said he intends to run again. \n\nThe first ward, third ward and an at-large seat are up for election in November along with the mayoral position. Mayor Mike Hansen has already turned in his candidacy forms and nomination, signaling his run for re-election. The Jasper County Auditor\u2019s Office also said a second mayoral candidate, Garfield Berndt III, has turned in papers, making it the only contested race so far. \n\nGoodwill Career Connection Center Coordinator Miranda Kulis announced last week her intentions to run for an at-large seat. \n\nForms, including an affidavit of candidacy and nomination petition, are now available through the auditor\u2019s office, as well as on the city\u2019s website.\u00a0 \n\nCandidates must get 25 signatures to move forward with the candidacy process. The deadline for filing is 5 p.m. Thursday. \n\nContact Jamee A. Pierson at 641-792-3121 ext. 6534 or jpierson@newtondailynews.com \nComments", "source": "Newton Daily News"}
