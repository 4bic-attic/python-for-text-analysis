NYCLASS\u2019 top priority is banning horse-drawn carriages from city streets, which is not popular citywide or in eastern Queens. Mayor Bill de Blasio also supports a ban.\n\nWhen pressed during a televised debate last month, Mr. Najmi said he hadn\u2019t yet made a decision on whether to vote for a ban. A City Council vote is not currently scheduled and it appears a bill to ban the carriages would not pass.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one of the big issues of the district and frankly I\u2019m more concerned about jobs, education, housing and seniors,\u201d Mr. Najmi said on NY1.\n\nSeveral Democrats, including Rebecca Lynch and Bob Friedrich, in the Queens City Council race said outright they would not vote to ban the carriages. Mr. Najmi did not tout the NYCLASS endorsement in any press release from his campaign, unlike endorsements from Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison and Zephyr Teachout, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Gov. Andrew Cuomo last year.\n\nNYCLASS boasts scores of volunteers and a war chest large enough to pay for television ads during a mayoral race, but it\u2019s not clear the well-heeled animal rights group will be able to provide any boost to Mr. Najmi with a day to go until Election Day. If Mr. Najmi eventually becomes a city councilman, he could eventually be a NYCLASS ally in their fight to ban the carriages.\n\nMr. Najmi did not immediately return a request for comment.", "source": "New York Observer"}
