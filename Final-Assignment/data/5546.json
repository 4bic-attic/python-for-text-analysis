That location is only a few hundred metres deeper than the continental shelf where the delicate ecosystem flourishes. \n \nUS co-author Dr James McClintock, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said: \" The only way to test the hypothesis that the crabs are expanding their depth-range is to track their movements through long-term monitoring.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "source": "Craven Herald"}
