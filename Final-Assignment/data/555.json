More rain but that was just tonight, the rest of the day was mint as weather sun shining and great for driving. Idiots were still out in force with a huge nose to tail in Whakatane crushing the back of a little hatch back which pushed the boot all the way to the back wheels in which a hilux surf rear ended it. Also had a Chorus van pass with oncoming traffic and nearly hitting the car it was passing. Also nearly Tboned a dickhead in Kawerau who pulled straight out in front of me, no seatbelt and arm hanging out the window so would of just popped straight out the door if I hit him. That could of been fun! So yeah, over today with the idiots so bring on the busy weekend.....", "source": "Life As A Courier"}
