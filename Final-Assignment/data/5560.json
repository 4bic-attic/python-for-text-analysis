Cost-benefit analyses must replace chants of \"the terrorists are coming\" and \"God [insert your favorite verb] America\".\n7. Of course if our government could govern transparently there would be no espionage prosecution and thus no need for a public interest defense.\n8. It can be useful to view government governance on a coercion-consent continuum with greater government coercion required to sustain greater societal imbalances.\nA decaying government will ignore destabilizing societal imbalances and cite these destabilizing societal imbalances as justification for utilizing greater government coercion, thereby accelerating its further decay and eventual destruction.", "source": "Exaphone"}
