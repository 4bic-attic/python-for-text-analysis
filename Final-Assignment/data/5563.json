This was compared to 31,000 in Manchester and 26,000 in Leeds. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe 11 cities looked at were London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield. \n \nMartin Abrams, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said the Government's plans did not pay enough attention to the predicament of those in the north. \n \nHe said: \"The overall Government strategy for rail improvement is paling quite badly \n \n\"We rarely hear about what is happening in the north of England where overcrowding is on the increase. \n \n\"There is no real strategy from the government about how to sort this out. Whilst there are many more commuters in the south east of England, the sheer disparity of infrastructure doesn't represent the increase in rail use in the north of England.\" \n \nThe DfT said that the overall level of crowding across the 11 cities has increased, with it being clear that much of the growth has taken place on routes that are already very busy. \n \nRail Minister Claire Perry said: \"We have seen record-breaking numbers use the railways in the past year, with 1.7 billion journeys completed in 2014, more than double the number recorded a decade ago. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"To meet this unprecedented demand we are investing \u00a338 billion in the railways for the five years until 2019, underpinned by flagship schemes like the Intercity Express and Thameslink programmes to provide more space and more seats on trains. \n \n\"I know how frustrated customers are with overcrowding, and I expect the rail industry, including operators, to continue to develop innovative proposals to meet the capacity challenge head on.\"", "source": "Yeovil Express"}
