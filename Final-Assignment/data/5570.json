Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton said the National Football League and Washington's football team \"should not be benefiting financially from federal antitrust exemptions while they continue to promote a disparaging moniker that has been found by legal authorities to be a racial slur.\" A federal judge in July upheld a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the name was \"disparaging to Native Americans\" and thus ineligible for federal trademark registration.", "source": "Daily sport news"}
