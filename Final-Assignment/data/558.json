In fact, Bo Sanchez, The Feast founder, intended it to be a place where the \u201cunchurched\u201d can experience God\u2019s love for them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s held in commercial places such as mall cinemas. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the testimonies that I, as managing editor of Kerygma magazine, have been receiving from Feast attendees, I can say that, truly, God is using it to extend His love to the people who are away from Him. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An example is Faye, a practicing lesbian then, who is now happily married to a man and is serving God through one of Bo\u2019s media ministries. The unconditional love she received from a caring group at The Feast made her see her true identity as a daughter of God. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jesus\u2019 style. Pope Francis\u2019s style. Bo\u2019s The Feast style. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They all seem to work in bringing people back to God. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u2019s your style? Tess V. Atienza (theresa.a@shepherdsvoice.com.ph) \u00a0 Reflection: Who brought you closer to God? Say a prayer for him or her now. \u00a0 Dear Jesus, thank You for showing us the way to love others, regardless of their past. Use me more to love and serve Your broken people. \u00a0 St. Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist, pray for us.", "source": "Daily Life Inspirations"}
