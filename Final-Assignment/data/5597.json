But others think Davis' position as a government official makes her exactly the wrong figure to rally around. \n\nProminent Christian commentators have suggested Davis' case could drive away support for religious liberty issues by stirring up anger at a public servant who refuses to do her job. \n\nDavis was released from jail Tuesday after a deputy clerk began issuing marriage licenses. Davis says she will return to her office Monday but has not said what she will do. \n \n\u00a9", "source": "Whistler Question"}
