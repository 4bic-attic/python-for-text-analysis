The Trojans could use a persuasive victory to move the focus past another eventful fall camp that was lowlighted by coach Steve Sarkisian's drunken speech at a pep rally and subsequent apologies.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nArkansas State WR J.D. McKissic vs. USC CBs Kevon Seymour and Adoree Jackson. McKissic already holds the Red Wolves' career records for receptions in a game, a season and a career, and he's catching passes from preseason all-conference QB Fredi Knighten. The Trojans' improved secondary will get an early test.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nArkansas State: DL Ja'Von Rolland-Jones. The sophomore was 14th in the nation last season with eight sacks, leading the Red Wolves' 37-sack production. He'll head their attempt to pressure Trojans QB Cody Kessler, who is historically accurate when given time to throw.\n\nUSC: RB Tre Madden. After missing two of the past three seasons with injuries, the power-running senior is expected to carry a heavy load for the Trojans this fall. Justin Davis is the only other scholarship veteran returnee at the position for Tailback U., but Madden finished a standout fall camp with complete health.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nArkansas State has never beaten a Pac-12 team, while USC is 8-0 against Idaho \u2014 the only current Sun Belt member that the Trojans have ever played. ...
