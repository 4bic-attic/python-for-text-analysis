Consider this: Nintendo is the sort of company that has specific ideas about the way Bowser would drink a cup of coffee in a movie. It is the sort of company that would develop a height graph, so game developers always know what size a character can be in relation to other creatures in the Mushroom Kingdom. Nintendo is very particular about how it wants the world to consume its games, and this attention to detail is part of what makes Nintendo great. Nintendo is the Disney of the gaming world; a controlling, creative titan that creates beloved characters with shocking regularity.\nEnter Super Mario Maker, a game about making Mario games. In it, people other than Nintendo are free to use official Mario iconography to create ridiculous levels, then cover those levels with dicks. Is Nintendo really just handing over their playbox and letting people loose with it? Can I seriously take Nintendo\u2019s most famous mascot and put him through a hellscape of my making\u2026with Nintendo\u2019s blessing?\nAdvertisement Well, OK then. Mario Maker has two major components. There\u2019s the creation suite, which allows players to make their own levels. Then there\u2019s the play hub, where you can simply enjoy Mario Maker levels made by other people. There, you will find the \u201c10 Mario Challenge,\u201d a mode where you have ten lives to beat eight random levels made by Nintendo designers. While it may be tempting to jump into stage creation right away, I found that playing through the 10 Mario Challenge was a better idea, at least to start out. Nintendo has made a point of creating short, punchy levels that defy the expectations they\u2019ve set over their years making Mario games. It\u2019s a provocative mode that plays with the Mario formula, at once evoking nostalgia while also telling you to forget what what you think you know about Mario. This, in turn, encourages you to experiment beyond what you might think is possible in your own levels. The 10 Mario Challenge is instructive in the most hands-on way possible. In one level, you might find an underground party when you go down a pipe. In a different level, you might find that the only thing that\u2019s standing between you and the flagpole is a stack of giant enemies crowned by Bowser, and you have to figure out a way to defeat them all without getting hit by a projectile. In another level, you might turn into a spring after ingesting a mushroom. Its the sort of thing that makes me wonder just what was stopping Nintendo from making levels that felt this fresh in the first place. This is Nintendo, letting its hair down\u2014and the result is a game that feels exciting and new, even though yes, we\u2019ve been stomping Goombas with our favorite plumber for over thirty (!) years now. This sense of vitality is everywhere in Mario Maker, from the weird levels down to the vibrant menus. Mario Maker looks less like what you\u2019d expect an official Mario game to look like, and more like a remix that could have been made by a studio like Crossy Road and Pac-Man 256-maker Hipster Whale. Even the some of the original sprites have been updated\u2014they now have finer details that previously weren\u2019t there. What I\u2019m saying is: Mario Maker looks hot as hell. Let\u2019s talk about level creation. Ostensibly, this is the entire point of Mario Maker: to create stuff. This was somewhat of an awkward proposition for me, someone who struggles with open-ended creativity\u2014I was the kid that didn\u2019t know what to do with Lego. I thought I wouldn\u2019t find much to like in the level-creation process, and instead wanted to use Mario Maker as a means to play stuff others create. But Mario Maker is so welcoming that I found myself happily experimenting with Koopas and question-mark blocks right away, eventually graduating to full-on levels that I was proud of. Any element you might find in a 2D Mario game, you can just place on your level with a simple tap. Anything that can occupy a large space can be placed and dragged and made longer. You can change the style of your level based on the different eras of Mario games across the years, from the original up to New Super Mario Bros U. Eventually, you\u2019ll even unlock special sound and visual effects that can add an extra layer of liveliness to your levels (I\u2019m sure the community won\u2019t abuse this at all!) It\u2019s the most intuitive game creation tool I\u2019ve ever used; it does for games what the point-and-click did for photography\u2014only with way more spirit. When you place something down in a level, the level actually sings for you. Building an entire course sounds like harmony. In this sense, Mario Maker feels revolutionary. Even a kid could make a level with ease. Why aren\u2019t there more tools like this, but for other kinds of game?\nThe tools themselves hide wonderful secrets. Shake a green Koopa, and it\u2019ll turn into a red Koopa. Shake a Lakitu, and you\u2019ll be left with its cloud\u2014which you can actually ride. Add a mushroom to an enemy, and it\u2019ll grow larger. All of these components stay frozen them until you press \u201cPlay,\u201d at which point the level goes live and you can test out whatever you made. And if Mario dies during this testing phase, it simply reverts back to creation mode, which allows you to tweak as you see fit. I found myself swapping between the frozen and live mode frequently, as I felt out what made the most sense for that particular level. Part of the reason why Mario Maker feels so generous is that, by giving me this box of toys, Nintendo has given me a first-hand look at what makes Mario, well, Mario. It\u2019s given me a new appreciation for what they\u2019ve created in the past, especially when I felt stumped as to how to make a level of mine pop. Even the O.G. 1-1 has a quiet brilliance that may not be immediately obvious until you break it down, square by square, and see the subtle ways in which Nintendo has been gently guiding us all along. My biggest complaint about Mario Maker\u2019s tools is that you can\u2019t use them all from the outset. You only have access to a limited number of things at the start, and it takes nine days of actively creating levels for at least five minutes to unlock everything on offer. It\u2019s the most Nintendo thing ever, and they justify it by saying that this is their way of easing you into the tools. They want to make sure you understand every set of objects they have before actually letting you tinker with more advanced stuff. It makes a sort of sense, but it\u2019s still kind of annoying. This, in conjunction with the incredible number of costume unlocks, make Mario Maker feel like more than just a toolbox. It\u2019s game design, gamified. Level creation requires assets. You\u2019re going to need to work for those assets, if not purchase a few Amiibo. Once you build a level, you can save it to your system or upload it to the web. Before you can share it with others, you have to actually beat your course\u2014which means you can\u2019t make anything impossible, or beyond your own skills. I appreciate this reality check, because it means that online levels can\u2019t get too out of hand. From there, you wait. You\u2019ll be notified whenever someone plays your level, or leaves a comment on it. You can also get a sense of how difficult your course is based on completion percentages, or by taking a look at where on your course people have died. This information is also visible when you zoom in on other people\u2019s courses, too. [This level is way harder than I intended\u2014barely anyone can beat it!] Nintendo has basically built a mini social network just for Mario Maker called \u201cCourse World.\u201d Through it, you can check out a variety of different courses people have uploaded, all sorted into different categories. There\u2019s the \u201cFeatured\u201d tab, which is front and center. I\u2019m not 100% clear on how Nintendo picks these courses, or if they\u2019re automated, but either way, the courses that become featured are the most visible courses in Mario Maker. That is where you want your courses to end up, which also means you have to deal with creating something palatable to other people. You have to pick a good name, and have a good concept, to facilitate being noticed\u2014otherwise, nobody will play your stuff. This, I assume, will be a point of tension for some players who don\u2019t have some marketing savvy. My version of Mario Maker only connects with people who have the game early. There are a very limited number of people online right now, likely microscopic in comparison to what the actual community will be like. Still, it\u2019s obvious that Mario Maker, like all social media, will have its share of politics. There are already people who come up with cool ideas that gain traction, only to be aped by other hopefuls who then end up gaining more visibility\u2014the Fat Jewishes of Mario Maker, essentially. There are already people who create levels based on well-known franchises, and end up piggy-backing on that success even if their course isn\u2019t particularly good. There already are trends and fads, like courses that play themselves. I predict there will also be creators who become popular and known within the community, only to become scorned because they\u2019re too visible\u2014or at least, I found myself annoyed at times that certain names seemed to be everywhere on Mario Maker\u2019s social hub. I have a feeling the online Course World is going to be a fascinating place once Mario Maker actually releases. If you see a course that you like on your Course World feed, you can download it for future use/tweaking, or you can \u201cstar\u201d it. Stars function similarly to Likes on Facebook, in that the more stars a course has, the higher they\u2019ll show up on the \u201cStar Ranking\u201d tab on Course World. And the more people who play and like your levels, the more courses you can upload. You can also follow specific people through Course World, and the game will notify you whenever those people make new stuff. It\u2019s a system that rewards popularity, but I\u2019m hoping that the game still leaves room for less conventional Mario levels too. It\u2019s hard to say just yet.\nAs for what you\u2019ll find online, well, you get a little bit of everything. If you try the 100 Mario Challenge, you\u2019ll get a grab bag of levels, some of which are really creative, some of which are clearly just someone fucking around. Personally, I liked messing with easy and normal mode the best\u2014I found that these types of courses were more likely to try something creative or fun. Some of my favorites include... A Donkey Kong themed level: A level with Metroid-Like progression: [Source: Pixelkabinett] A shmup: [Source: GameXplain] Roller-coaster type levels: And this troll level: Then there\u2019s expert mode. I\u2019m sure that Mario connoisseurs will love this offering, and that there will be a variety of absurd Kaizo-Level courses in no time. My issue is that many of the expert courses I came across didn\u2019t really ramp up and ease you into the difficulty, nor do courses typically teach you how to play them at that level. Many of them kind of slap you in the face from the get go, or appear to be going for difficulty for the sake of difficulty. There is no palpable sense of design or purpose beyond stripped-down game-designer sadism. [An example of the sort of fucked-up stuff you can expect from asshole Mario Maker creators, courtesy of Jeffrey Grubb] It\u2019s here that the biggest \u201cflaw\u201d of Mario Maker comes through: lots of people simply do not have that je ne sais quoi, that classic Nintendo touch. Mario levels are so memorable because Nintendo puts effort into making sure levels can be enjoyed both by beginners and experts. Levels they create go through an intense iterative process that puts function and design above all else. Miyamoto has been known to playtest games by watching people\u2019s expressions while they play games, to get an honest reaction to a level. I don\u2019t know if this feeling can be taught, exactly\u2014there are interviews where Miyamoto says he bases design based on \u201cwhat feels good instinctively,\u201d and has even expressed that sometimes, this sixth sense is difficult to describe to the staff at Nintendo. It\u2019s just the sort of thing that he knows when he sees it. Sometimes, exceptional design simply cannot be captured in words; it can merely be observed and felt. Through years of experience, Nintendo has developed a good system that can eventually carve out the finest platformers around. Mario Maker tries to guide you via tips and sample levels, but there is only so much that it can pass on to its players. The only real thing you can do is make what you want, send it off into the void, and hope for the best. It\u2019s that rawness that separates Mario Maker from core Mario games\u2014and what makes Mario Maker so interesting in the first place. The \u201cflaw\u201d isn\u2019t really a flaw at all. Mario Maker is the embodiment of play, and play cannot always be wrangled or parceled for consumption. It can be messy, and weird, a and far too difficult, placing a tower of giant Bowsers in your path just because it can. I keep coming back to the idea that Mario Maker shouldn\u2019t exist. It gleefully flies in the face of Nintendo\u2019s controlling nature, and gives players the means with which to theoretically render every subsequent 2D Mario game obsolete. But Mario Maker is also a sign of Nintendo\u2019s confidence. The world will never stop wanting that special Nintendo magic, and Nintendo knows that. Nintendo just want to give us a chance to make our own fun for a change and, in the process, learn to understand what they do a little better. Mario Maker is Nintendo going, Hey kid. You\u2019ve seen what we can do. What about you?", "source": "io9"}
