It opens in a vertical panel on the right side of the workspace and enables you to conduct keyword searches of Google Search, Google Images, OpenClipart, and Twitter. Adding information to your map is a simple drag-and-drop operation. \n \nI conducted several searches using the Research Panel, and was satisfied with its responsiveness. Links and images opened quickly, and it was easy to drag and drop information to my mind map. I especially liked the Twitter mentions, which appear in their entirety in my mind map \u2013 along with a large, blue Twitter icon. This makes it easy to see the source of this information at a glance. \n \nThe one problem I ran into was attempting to drag and drop a larger image from Google image search into my mind map. As I approached the topic where I wanted to drop it, the floating image completely covered it, making it impossible to see if my destination topic was highlighted. As a result, two attempts at adding this image to my map resulted in it getting attached to the wrong topic the first time, and as a floating image the second time. \n Interactive HTML mind maps  \nInteractive mind maps in iMindQ 7 are saved in an HTML format that you can upload on any website, blog or document management system, share on social media networks or send it via e-mail. They can be opened with any browser and can be zoomed, navigated and presented as animated stories or edited within the browser itself. \n \nI exported a simple mind map with 8 first-level topics and 2 second-level topics, and then opened it in a web browser. It opens with a small, vertical toolbar with 6 controls in the upper left corner of the page that allow you to zoom in, zoom out, center the map, zoom it to fill the screen and play an animation of it. The last option draws each branch, one at a time; there doesn\u2019t appear to be a way to control the animation on a branch-by-branch basis. If you could do so, it would be more useful as a presentation tool. The top button takes you to the iMindQ web page. I think Seavus hopes that people who view your exported mind maps will be intrigued and will want to learn more about the program. \n \nIf you click on an information icon in the upper right corner of the screen, a pop-over window appears that explains what you can do with this mind map. I tried dragging and dropping topics as it instructed; this worked smoothly. Hypertext links open in a new tab. You can also add and remove topics to an interactive mind map, although it\u2019s not immediately obvious how to do so. By trial and error, I figured out that you can use the Insert key to do so (the de facto standard for adding topics to mind maps). It would be nice if this was called out in the instructions. \n \nI\u2019m not sold on the idea of giving people the ability to modify your mind maps, but the developer says any changes visitors make are not saved to the existing map. Topics can be removed by visitors so they can remove any extraneous topics that aren\u2019t relevant to them, giving them a clearer picture of the remaining topics. \n Enhanced note taking  \niMindQ 7\u2019s topic notes panel has been enhanced in this new version to enable you to do more complex formatting. You can now insert: \n  Images  Tables  Links to external web pages, mind map topics, files, folders and e-mails   \nThe toolbar looks much like Microsoft Word, with buttons logically grouped. One nice feature is a pair of buttons that enable you to move to the previous or next searches you\u2019ve conducted. If you do a lot of online research and find yourself going back to previous sources to double-check your information, you\u2019ll appreciate this feature. \n \nAnother plus: A \u201cremove formatting\u201d button that reverts any text you import to the program\u2019s default text style (Arial 8 pt.). Why is this important? Often, when you capture information from web pages, your notes inherit whatever formatting the web page designer used. This feature enables you to easily strip that out, giving your notes a neater, more uniform look. \n \nHypertext links were a pleasant surprise. Usually, mind mapping programs contain only one option for topic note links: To a web page address. Clicking on the links icon in notes view opens a dialog box that gives you 4 options: \n  Map topic (opens an outline view of your mind map so you can select the topic to which you want to link)  Web page  File or folder  Email (this doesn\u2019t link to specific e-mail messages; it simply lets you add a mailto: link to your notes, which opens a new mail form pre-addressed to the e-mail address you put in the link)   \nThis gives you a lot of flexibility to tie together your notes with other sources \u2013 nice! \n \nI do have several minor complaints with notes view, however: First, you can\u2019t drag an image to resize it. I randomly selected an image from my laptop\u2019s hard drive, without paying attention to its size, and added it to the notes view. It appeared quite large, so I tried to figure out how to resize it. With the developer\u2019s help, I learned that this can be accomplished via a right-click \u201csize\u201d command, which asks you to input new dimensions in pixels. \n \nNext, I added a table to my notes. This worked fine, except that I expected it to behave like tables do in Microsoft Word \u2013 but it didn\u2019t. For example, I\u2019m used to adding text to a table cell and then using the Tab key to move to the next cell. Apparently, iMindQ 7 doesn\u2019t support this. Also, it doesn\u2019t appear to be possible to adjust column widths. Once again, it\u2019s nice that the program supports this functionality, but it could be improved. \n Import and export OPML format  \nOPML is sort of like the Rosetta Stone of mind mapping software: It enables you to share maps with other programs. iMindQ 7 now has the ability to import and export mind maps in this file format. I exported my simple mind map to OPML and then opened it in a competing mind mapping program. All of the topics and links appeared properly, but topic notes were stripped out. This isn\u2019t iMindQ\u2019s fault; rather, it\u2019s a limitation of the OPML format. It\u2019s nice to see Seavus supporting such interactivity. \n New map parts save time  \niMindQ 7 now includes 53 map parts that are designed around the needs of typical business people. They are divided into groups: \n  Analysis  Brainstorming  General business  Meeting  Project  Quality assurance   \nI\u2019m a big fan of map parts, because they speed the production of mind maps. Why reinvent the wheel when you can simply drag and drop a map part into your existing mind map? \n \niMindQ\u2019s map parts appear in a vertical panel on the right side of the workspace. They are displayed as a set of thumbnail images and names. A drop-down list lets you filter the long list of map parts by group, making it easier to navigate. To add a map part to your mind map, you have two options: drag and drop it, or utilize a right-click command. \n \nYou can also convert branches of your mind maps into map parts. Simply select the topic you want to designate as the parent topic of your new map part, and click on the \u201cadd selected topic(s)\u201d link at the bottom of the map parts panel. I really like this capability, because it enables you to customize iMindQ 7 to your needs. If you frequently create the same types of maps, you\u2019ll love this time-saving feature. \n Presentation mode adds\u00a0advanced animations  \niMindQ 7 now enables you to automatically create a presentation from your mind map with a single click. It creates a series of \u201cscenes\u201d that appear in a vertical panel on the left side of the program\u2019s workspace. You can also add your own scenes manually. But the new version of iMindQ takes presentation mode one step farther by providing a set of sophisticated animation tools that are very similar to the ones in Microsoft PowerPoint. They give you options such as focus, fade in, fade out, blur and rotate; you can easily preview these effects using a button at the bottom of the preview panel. In addition, it contains controls that let you control when the effect occurs (on click, with previous, with next) and several timing controls. \n \nThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen such animation tools applied to a mind mapping program, and I must say, I like it a lot. It\u2019s a great way to add extra \u201csizzle\u201d to your presentations, and it\u2019s designed to encourage experimentation. \n \nWhen you play a presentation, you advance through the scenes you\u2019ve created using the space bar. I\u2019m pleased to see that iMindQ 7 zooms and pans you around your mind map, one topic at a time, instead of breaking it into \u201cslides\u201d that look disjointed and don\u2019t give you a sense of where the topic you\u2019re viewing resides within the overall mind map. \n Conclusion  \nSeavus continues to evolve iMindQ quickly, adding many new features while maintaining decent ease of use. I especially like the new research panel, which makes it easy to do online research without having to switch between this mind mapping program and a web browser. Map parts are also a valuable addition. Many of us tend to perform the same tasks in our work on a regular basis. The ability to create and store branch templates is a real time-saver for these repetitive tasks. \n \nOverall, with the exception of a few minor usability issues, iMindQ 7 is a very capable program that is well-suited to many business applications. iMindQ 7 continues to be an excellent value at $142 (\u20ac109.0) for a single license with a one-year software maintenance agreement. To experience this new version of iMindQ firsthand, you can download a 15-day trial version of it here . \n \nThe post iMindQ 7 offers expanded toolset for gathering, organizing and sharing information appeared first on Mind Mapping Software Blog .", "source": "Mind Mapping Software Blog"}
