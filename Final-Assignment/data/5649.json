The Economic Times reported that the Apple Watch will enter the Indian market next week. Just a few days ago, Apple had launched its new iPhones and iPads as well as an upgraded WatchOS 2 to the Apple Watch. \n \n\n \nWhile the new iPhones are scheduled to come out in mid-October, the Apple Watch will be here before the festive Navratri period which starts in October. The Apple Watch has been introduced in limited countries and the company is also set for the software upgrade. The upgrade will introduce Facebook Messenger and an app called iTranslate. \n \n \n \nApple has tied up with Hermes for brand new bands. But whether the gold and rose gold bands will make it to India next week is still not known, though Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has stated that the new options will be available in all the 24 markets where the watch is currently sold. \n \nThe Apple Watch is expected to be priced somewhere in between Rs 25,000-30,000. It will be interesting to see whether the watch will make it big in the Indian market as it has not seen much popularity in wearable technology, yet.", "source": "iGyaan.in"}
