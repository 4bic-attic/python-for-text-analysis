This extensive Chianti sub-zone covers some 675 hectares of vines and is home to\u00a086 producers, over 15 communes. The Colli Aretini wines have a unique character, which is typified by a bright violet hue due to the slightly acid soils of the area.\u00a0According to Carlo Ferrini, winemaker consultant to \"Tenuta Sette Ponti,\"\u00a0the wines have more length than width, with good body, yet not as full and round as other\u00a0classic Tuscan wine-making\u00a0areas. \u00a0 In recent years, the area has attracted big investors such as the Ferragamo fashion magnate, owner of \"Il Borro estate\" who favours a modern, polished bordolaise blend to the traditional Sangiovese. Antonio Moretti of Sette Ponti has recently channeled his dynamic energy from the world of fashion to producing some of the areas top 'crus' with his Crognolo 90% Sangiovese and Oreno a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot. Traditional quality wines can be found at the well-established estates of \"Tenuta San Fubiano\" with its classic Chianti Putto, \"Villa La Selva\" with its elegant Sangiovese, Felciaia and Petrolo's Sangiovese Il Torrione and fine bottling of Merlot, Galatrona. New emerging estate \"Mannucci Droandi,\"\u00a0producing a good organic Chianti Colli Aretini, Campolucci, has done extensive research into the conservation of old vine varieties of the area, setting up an experimental vineyard for micro-vinification.\n\u00a0 Piazza Grande in Arezzo (Anguskirk/flickr) \u00a0 Key players in the production of wine in the Colli Aretini areas are, certainly,\u00a0\"Tenuta Sette Ponti,\"\u00a0\"Fattoria di Petrolo,\" \"Villa La Selva,\" \"Fattoria di San Fabiano,\" \"Il Borro\" and \"Manucci Droandi.\" \u00a0 Wine in and around Arezzo come under the Chianti Colli Aretini DOC\u00a0and DOCG\u00a0and include the following denominations: Chianti DOCG, Chianti Colli Aretini DOCG, Colli d'Etruria Centrale DOC, Valdichiana DOC, Cortona DOC,Vinsanto del Chianti DOC e Vinsanto del Chianti dei Colli Aretini DOC. The charme and the beauty of the Colli Aretini (Ward Kadel-drXeNo/flickr) \u00a0 Arezzo's typical regional food products and recipes Tuscan food is a triumph of nature: it is simple\u00a0country cooking and it may lack a bit in imagination, but expresses an almost mystical symbiosis between a people and their land. The elaborations exported to France by the Medici are long gone and mostly forgotten. Also vanishing, sadly, are the inspired dishes that used to take cheerful Tuscan mamme\u00a0all morning to create. But the basics are still there: country bread baked in wood-fired ovens and the emerald-green extra-vergine olive oil that combines so well in bruschetta and pane unto; exquisite vegetables and greens that make a minestrone easy (Tuscans have always been more resourceful with hearty thick soups than pasta);\u00a0rosemary, garlic, onion, sage, basil, bay leaves, and tarragon that heighten flavour; and, of course, the bean, so adored that when detractors couldn't think of anything worse they called Tuscans mangiafagioli (bean eaters). \u00a0 Tuscans are big meat eaters and Tuscan food is greatly characterized by grilled or roasted meats: chicken, pork, duck, pigeon and Florence's legendary bistecca alla fiorentina (hefty slab of Chianina beef - a real one weighs about 1kg with bone and all). Boar and game birds are also prized in this most wooded Italian region. Some of Italy's tastiest Pecorino cheese comes from sheep grazed in the stark hills of Siena. \u00a0 Some of Tuscany's most famous dishes and produce \u00a0 Arezzo's food: ribollita (Jenn Vargas/flickr) Arista Pork loin: roasted pork, flavored\u00a0with rosemary and garlic.

It mixes together\u00a0onions, artichokes, fava beans, asparagus, and bacon.
