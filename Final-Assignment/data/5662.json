I hadn\u2019t read much of the book yet then, (Tom wasn\u2019t even at Rugby yet), but now that I\u2019ve finished it, the answer is yes. \n \nHarry Potter is the school story that I know best, and it\u2019s full of elements that appear inspired by Tom\u2019s days at Rugby: A long, & special, journey to get to school, a special attachment to the headmaster, and a new and novel sport are some examples. \n \nNovelists from more than 150 years ago seem to need an editor, though. There are parts where\u00a0the author drags on\u00a0\u2013 similar to what I found in The Last of the Mohicans , (although it\u2019s even older). \n \nI enjoyed the older production qualities of my particular edition of the book, from the \u201cBlackie\u2019s Library for Boys and Girls.\u201d I think this is from 1952, old enough that the letters are pressed into the pages, sometimes with a bit too much ink, and the pages\u00a0themselves are so thick that it\u2019s tough to push my book darts \u00a0onto the page. At 272 pages my copy is also shorter than many non-abridged editions, so it may be\u00a0abridged, in which case I would like to know and read what I missed.", "source": "John Beales"}
