While individual support by Goa Ministers such as\nSudin Dhavalikar and Deepak Dhavalikar is deplorable, but it\nis not entirely surprising due to their known narrow-minded\nand regressive opinions on various issues.\" \n\nThe AAP leader also alleged that Chief Minister Laxmikant\nParsekar remains oblivious, or pretends to be oblivious, of\nsimple facts when conveniently stating that an organisation\ncannot be banned due to the actions of one person, in\nreference to the recent arrest of Samir Gaikwad.", "source": "Sify"}
