It just shows the kind of guy Gordon is and all that he is about. He didn\u2019t have to do this but it shows he\u2019s actually in touch with Joe Public.\" \n \n\"We\u2019re just waiting on a call from one of his team about Aaron starting the job.\" \n \nThis is not the first time Ramsay has helped a junior chef on social media. \n \nIn April this year, a chef took the opportunity to use Ramsay's Ask Me Anything session to get some career advice. \n \nThe young chef told of how he was struggling to keep up his passion in the midst of a relentless work schedule and unhelpful bosses. \n \nRamsay not only gave some advice\u00a0\u2014 essentially that there is nothing wrong with taking a break or getting a change of scene to recharge the batteries\u00a0\u2014 he offered the put upon chef a job. \n \nRamsay went on to write: \"Listen\u00a0\u2014 if you send me your resume, I could look at putting you into one of the restaurants as a work experience, if you want to see something different, in order to make sure you don't come off the rails, to see something different, to create that level of interest.\" \n \nSource: Closer Online, Metro UK", "source": "Electric New Paper"}
