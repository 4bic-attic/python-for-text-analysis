Hearth \n\nI look into the small theatre of the fire\n\nWhere flames play something from a distant repertoire\n\nAnd shape my loss. Someone has left an impression\n\nFrom which a cast of words can nearly be taken;\n\nThough words, the truth, and understanding aren't enough,\n\nThey're not nothing \u2013 footprints, definite hints of stuff.\n\nThought softens at the edges like roofs in a drift.\n\nI hear these logs squealing, the lid on your rice lift.\n\nI see the point of distraction, far-starred effect\n\nWhose spark-propelled advice to get real I accept\n\nQuickly, and then forget. Help me, warmth, constellate\n\nThe night with glowing notices. Weren't we both great?\n\nWill Eaves", "source": "WA Today"}
