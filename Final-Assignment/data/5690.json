The second gave them a 25-24 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass to Ed Batties. \n \nStockstill threw for 330 yards and three touchdowns. Batties caught 13 passes for 175 yards and two of those touchdowns. \n\nWes Lunt led Illinois with 238 yards passing and a touchdown. \n\nThis story will be updated.", "source": "Pantagraph.com"}
