But it was coming.\u201d\n\nThe play in question was a simple sideline screen on a first-and-15 at the ECU 28. Fulwood took the pass from Treon Harris and was hit initially by Brunson. Fulwood lowered his shoulders and then pushed Brunson and Biggers several yards back to turn what looked like a gain of just a couple of yards into an 8-yard gain.\n\nAustin Hardin missed a field goal a few plays later but Fulwood\u2019s point had been made, both to himself and McElwain \u2014 who said a simple 8-yard gain spoke volumes to him.\n\n\u201cHe took that thing [the ball] and really said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be denied,\u2019 \u201d McElwain said. \u201cHe really took it to the defender. It was great. That was, to me, really good to see.\u201d\n\nFulwood\u2019s teammates also jumped to praise him.\n\n\u201cThat was big. \u2026 He ran somebody over and it says he\u2019s willing to do what it takes to get the yards,\u201d said cornerback Quincy Wilson.\n\nFulwood plans on giving his coaches more of that.\n\n\u201cI should play that way, every game, every time,\u201d he said. \u201cI should be the most aggressive person on the field.\u201d\n\nFulwood caught the first two passes of the season for a modest 15 yards against the Pirates, obviously not the start to the season he might have envisioned. Fulwood has so far fallen short of expectations with 29 receptions for 326 yards and two touchdowns in his first two years at UF.\n\nHowever, he still earned one of the three starting wide receiver jobs and has held onto it through the first two games.\n\nIt must have come as a bit of a surprise, then, to hear McElwain calling Fulwood out during his first game-week news conference before opening the season against New Mexico State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see that he plays 6-foot-3 rather than 5-foot-8 at times,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cGo up and get the ball. Be aggressive in the air. Don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nFulwood said he didn\u2019t take offense but \u201ctook it to heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have talked about it. \u2026 I know where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d Fulwood said. \u201cHe wants the best out of me and he wants every single weapon I have to offer.\u201d\n\nAt the time, many who heard McElwain\u2019s comments might have thought he meant Fulwood doing better on deep passes.\n\nHowever, he was referring to the total package and even though Fulwood did not have a reception in the 61-13 victory over New Mexico State (14 other Gator players did) McElwain said he saw some promising signs with his blocking and route-running.\n\n\u201cHe did some really good things that didn\u2019t necessarily show up in the box score,\u201d McElwain said.\n\nFulwood also said that McElwain demands more of his wide receivers than simply going deep.\n\n\u201cEvery receiver that comes here has that big-play ability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coaches know that. They\u2019re looking for the guy who can fight for those extra yards. We\u2019ve got those guys and I\u2019m proud to be one of them.\u201d\n\nGarry Smits: (904) 359-4362", "source": "Florida Times-Union"}
