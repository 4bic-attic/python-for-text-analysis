There\u2019s nothing wrong with being 20 and not having been kissed. There\u2019s nothing wrong with starting college never having had a boyfriend/girlfriend/romantic partner. You aren\u2019t weird or an outcast because you haven\u2019t been on a date by a socially constructed time frame.\n\n\nThis is so important", "source": "I dare you to love me"}
