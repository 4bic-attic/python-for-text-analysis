Instead of submitting to God:\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I believe that we are so enamored with warfare is because it is at the gut level, the extension of us declaring ourselves as God over other human beings.\u201d\n\u2013 Carl Teichrib on Caravan to Midnight, Ep. 363, 9/2/15\nTranscribed by Jeff Fenske\nRelated:\n\nRon Paul: Christian Just War Theory \u2014 \u201cEvidently, I have been reading a different Bible.

(2) Can we remember the innocent victims of war even as we remember those who died while fighting? (3) Can we remember without the \u201cus versus them\u201d factor? \u2014 Perhaps if all who died were\u00a0commemorated\u2026\nChuck Baldwin: Why Do Evangelicals Ignore Ron Paul? |\u00a0My Opinion\n\nChuck Baldwin: What Does John Hagee Really Want? \u2014 \u201cThese WARMONGERING EVANGELICALS beat the war drums; they encourage the young men from their churches to go off and fight these \u2018holy\u2019 wars; they WORK TIRELESSLY TO ELECT PRO-WAR POLITICIANS\u2026. Then, the politicians \u2026 send the US military to invade, bomb, and KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people, the vast majority of whom are innocent people. \u2026 ANIMOSITY against the United States is GROWING EXPONENTIALLY; in an effort to keep our country at war, our ECONOMY is being overburdened and overtaxed TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN; in the name of the \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d America is on the verge of becoming a giant POLICE STATE; we are INCITING CHINA AND RUSSIA INTO NUCLEAR WAR; and America\u2019s military VETERANS are KILLING THEMSELVES more frequently than are enemy\u00a0bullets\u201d\n\nRon Paul: \u201cI\u2019m supporting Chuck Baldwin\u201d & \u201cthe most difficult group to recruit has been the evangelicals who supported McCain and his pro-war positions\u201d\n\nThe Amazing Ron Paul: Bribe Money \u2014 \u201cWars should not be covert or casual. We absolutely should not be paying off leaders of a country while killing their civilians\u2026. This is not what America is supposed to be about.\u201d\n\nPat Buchanan: \u201cOn foreign policy \u2026 Ron Paul and Sarah Palin are on opposite sides completely.\u201d What would Jesus do?\n\nSarah Palin demonstrates why most evangelicals dissed Ron Paul, who wanted to bring the troops home. \u2018Christians\u2019 have two sets of books: one for US and one for THEM (\u201cwho don\u2019t deserve rights\u201d). THEY\u2019re not our \u2018neighbor\u2019 whom Jesus commanded US to love as much as ourselves. Maybe that\u2019s why most evangelicals refuse to investigate 9/11. If THEY didn\u2019t take down the towers\u2026???\n\nRon Paul on Evangelical Christians Expected to Be Pro-War All the Time\n\nRon Paul on what precedes LIBERTY: Life \u201cand I mean all LIFE!\u201d\n\nRon Paul: \u201cFascism Comes Wrapped In A Flag, Carrying A Cross\u201d\n\nRon Paul: Jesus is the Prince of PEACE, Not Preemptive War\n\nRon Paul\u2019s Christlike Attitude: Love, Peace & Hope \u2013 No *Initiation* of Aggression!\n\nRon Paul Speaks To The Right To Life Foundation\n\nRon Paul at the Faith & Freedom Coalition Conference: \u201cLife does begin at conception.\u201d \u2014 We would like to think all we have to do is elect the right politicians and everything is going to be okay. But the government is a reflection of the people. The people change before the laws change. Morality has a lot to do with legislation.\n\nLew Rockwell: The Enemy is in Washington. That\u2019s why RON PAUL runs NOT FOR GLORY, not for POWER, not for CONTROL. He runs to dismantle the aperatus in Washington. He wants to stop the war, stop the Fed\u2019s counterfeiting, stop the rip-offs for the big bank, the big corporation, and for Big Pharma.\u201d | CAN RON PAUL WIN? CAN THE \u2018CHRISTIANS\u2019 put their DESIRE FOR BLOOD below their desire to have some kind of standard of living\u2026?\n\n\u201cBlessed are the PEACEMAKERS\u201d Ron Paul: Well meaning church people are keeping the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d [the war against the CIA\u2019s competition] going, which helps finance the dark side of our government \u2014 our own demise!\n\nVote For Peace \u2013 Ron Paul 2012 \u2014 \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God\u201d \u2013 Jesus\n\n[Repentance from Power-OVER music video] Golden State: Bombs (End This War/The Ron Paul Song) \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that we can end this war / Just let your heart explode / It\u2019s not to late for a miracle! \u2014 No more lying; No more sighing; I\u2019m still trying, Arms wide open!\u201d | Lets\u2019 be real Christians \u2014 \u201cBlessed are the PEACEMAKERS, for they shall be called CHILDREN OF GOD\u201d \u2013 Jesus\n\n[Daily Paul comment] The real reason evangelical \u2018Christians\u2019 won\u2019t support Ron Paul \u2014 \u201cthe so called evangelical right wing\u2019s incredible and insatiable lust for war. War is not a family value. War is certainly not a Christian value. \u2026 Christ\u2019s views on love and peace and so forth are pretty clearly spelled out. \u2026 Many professing Christians will be numbered with the goats on judgement\u00a0day.\u201d\n\nSean Stone (Oliver Stone\u2019s son): Should the United States Bomb Iran?
