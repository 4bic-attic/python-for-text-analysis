Police and firefighters responded to an accident about 6:10 p.m. Friday on Chapel Street. A 16-year-old Canton High School student was reversing a Jeep Commander out of his family\u2019s driveway when he lost control, police said. The vehicle hit the fence in front of his family\u2019s home, then spun out of control, coming to a rest against a neighbor\u2019s house, police said. Two of the residents were home at the time, but were not injured. \u201cIt appears right now that the vehicle was in reverse and he was possibly trying to gain control of the vehicle and his door was still open,\u201d Canton Police Chief Ken Berkowitz said. The teenager, who police did not identify, was partially ejected from the Jeep, which then rolled over him. The boy ended up pinned on the ground between the car and the house. \u201cIt appears that he may have been run over by his own vehicle,\u201d Berkowitz said. Firefighters initially called for a medical helicopter, but decided to rush the teenager to Norwood Hospital because he suffered serious injuries, police said. On Chapel Street, as Canton police and state police investigators took photographs at the scene Friday evening, one of the teen\u2019s flip flops sat in the road. Canton police confirmed on Saturday morning that the teenager died. Grief counselors are available at Canton High School for students coping with the loss of a classmate.
