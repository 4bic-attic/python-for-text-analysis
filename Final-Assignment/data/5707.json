It allegedly proves that her grandmother was of Jewish origin and that the Nazis confiscated the noble family's property on racial grounds in 1942. \n \nA new hearing was then allowed by both the Rychnov and the Regional Court in Hradec Kralove. \n \nThe chateau became state property after 1945 when it went to the state based on president Edvard Benes' decrees. \n \nAccording to the decrees, the property of collaborators, traitors, ethnic Germans and Hungarians, except for those who themselves suffered under the Nazis, was confiscated. \n \nThe Mansfelds sought the return of their property after the war. When communists seized power in former Czechoslovakia in 1948, they emigrated to Austria. \n \nThe Colloredo-Mansfelds owned the Opocno chateau for three centuries and they had it rebuilt in baroque style at the beginning of the 18th century. \n \nCopyright 2015 by the Czech News Agency (\u010cTK).
