In the MIT report, Knight said he asked an Americanized Pepper if it\u2019s like Terminator, to which it responded: \u201cDo I really have to answer that?\u201d Pepper is a robot that\u2019s designed to recognize human emotions, and is supposed to read social situations so it can interact with you like a person can. And since people already ask Siri questions that get sassy comebacks, Pepper\u2019s gotta be ready. Advertisement \u201cIn the U.S., we have this kind of C-3PO idea, where he\u2019s kind of snarky and kind of smart,\u201d Alia Pyros, international communications manager of Aldebaran Robotics, told Knight. Aldebaran is the French robotics company that made Pepper, while Japanese telecom giant SoftBank bankrolled (and now owns) the robot. In Japan, \u201ckawaii\u201d (cute) culture is pervasive, from the menagerie of local government mascots to Pok\u00e9mon occasionally plastered on the jets of major Japanese airlines. Pepper\u2019s demeanor fits with that market: super polite and giggly, which might go over like a lead balloon with some Americans. Why is this important? Because it shows that robot \u201cpersonalities\u201d will be programmed to fit into whatever culture or market they\u2019re functioning in. Or maybe someday, a talking, interactive robot could code switch on the fly, tweaking its personality (and of course, language) to better coexist with its mammalian counterparts. So far, Pepper\u2019s making waves in the robotics scene. Earlier this month, a drunk dude in Yokohama apparently got pissed at a SoftBank shop employee and kicked a Pepper on the scene, damaging it. SoftBank also reminded customers that Peppers aren\u2019t to be used for you, uh, licentious needs. Pepper costs around $1,600, plus monthly subscription fees that cover software updates and regular maintenance. It\u2019ll make its wise-crackin\u2019 Western debut sometime next year.
