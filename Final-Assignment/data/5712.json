When Natasha was announced as the third-place housemate, not all the viewing public was happy to see Austin still there. \n  \nI'm panicking Austin might win #CBB \n \n\u2014 Nick Henderson (@NickHenderson6) September 24, 2015 \n  \nThe British public make the WORST decisions in my opinion. How could they seriously leave Austin in the final 2! #CBB \n \n\u2014 Foreverbbuk (@foreverbbuk) September 24, 2015 \n  \nIf Austin wins, I'll lose all hope in humanity. #CBB \n \n\u2014 Cami Li (@CamiLiModel) September 24, 2015 \n \nStill, the show was set up from the start as the UK v the USA \u2013 and that was how it remained to the very end. \n  \nSo it's UK v USA final 2 ! #CBB \n \n\u2014 laurab (@laurajbarr1981) September 24, 2015 \n \nIn the end though it was James, the bookies\u2019 favourite, who won. \n \nAnd a very popular winner he was too. With everyone\u2026 \n  \nGo on Jimbob  #CBB \n \n\u2014 Helen Wood (@Helen_Wood86) September 24, 2015 \n  \nGET IN THERE JAMES. #CBB \n \n\u2014 Ben (@bmass96) September 24, 2015 \n  \nVery happy for James. He deserved to win! #CBB \n \n\u2014 Gogglebox Josh (@tapperofficial) September 24, 2015 \n  \nYES!!! Well done James \n\nGreat name too  #CBB \n \n\u2014 James Jordan (@The_JamesJordan) September 24, 2015 \n  \nSO HAPPY JAMES WON OMG #cbbfinal \n \n\u2014 eden  (@edenjholmes) September 24, 2015 \n \n\u2026well, nearly everyone. \n  \nAustin to win. Judas Hill has been a game player. Game players shouldn't win #CBB \n \n\u2014 Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) September 24, 2015 \n \nBut while James seemed to be universally popular with the viewers (except Katie Hopkins), Austin was a lot more divisive. \n  \nSo glad Austin didn't win  #CBBUK \n \n\u2014 Bradley \u26c5\ufe0f (@Blossite) September 24, 2015 \n  \nThink Austin deserved it out of the him and James. Austin wasn't afraid to show his good and bad sides and put his heart and soul into it\u2026 \n \n\u2014 Sean Conlon (@SeanConlonMusic) September 24, 2015 \n  \nI really wanted Austin to win \n \n\u2014 Anerhi. (@whateverhiane) September 24, 2015 \n  \nI don't even know why Austin is getting cheered, let alone how he came second?!?! #CBB \n \n\u2014 Matteo Davies (@MatthewDavies__) September 24, 2015 \n  \nReally wanted Austin to win! #cbbfinal \n \n\u2014 Charley Dummer (@CharleyDummer) September 24, 2015 \n  \nAustin is so real and honest. He's been funny, entertaining and just a perfect housemate @austinarmacost  #CBB  #CBBfinal \n \n\u2014 Zacckkk (@BurgerManZack) September 24, 2015 \n \nUltimately, though, it wasn\u2019t about Austin \u2013 it was about James, the failed Apprentice contestant turned Celebrity Big Brother champion. \n \nJames was clearly overwhelmed as he exited the house to cheers, screams and pyrotechnics \u2013 he took it all in, saying: \u201cOh my god. Wow.\u201d \n \nHe charmed host Emma Willis from the start of his exit interview, telling her she looked great \u2013 and he charmed the audience all over again. And Philip Schofield. \n  \nCongratulations @JHill_Official my winner from pretty much the get go #CBB \n \n\u2014 Phillip Schofield (@Schofe) September 24, 2015 \n  \nJames the charmer  #CBBFinale  #CBBJames  #CBB \n \n\u2014 Berni (@berniiclarke) September 24, 2015 \n  \nSo happy james won CBB as he nice fella and means more photoshoots in his pants yay \n \n\u2014 gizmo (@gizmo_v3) September 24, 2015 \n \nAlthough some people thought he might have pushed it just a bit too far\u2026 \n  \n\u2018I\u2019ve tried to put people first\u2026 we\u2019ve all been on a journey in that house.\u2019 Dear God. #cbb  #cbbfinal \n \n\u2014 lightupvirginmary (@lightupvm) September 24, 2015 \n \nAnd of course, he had a message for Austin too. \n  \n\"He's my number one.\" Awwwwww, it's getting very soppy. #CBB \n \n\u2014 Big Brother UK (@bbuk) September 24, 2015 \n   \n Share article  \n    \nAhhhhh.
