Bella Bond's body was found June 25. \n \nA composite image of the girl, dubbed Baby Doe during the investigation, had been viewed by millions as authorities tried to identify her. After Boston police received a tip, a search warrant was executed Thursday at the apartment of her mother, Rachelle Bond. \n \nAmoroso says Bond told him her boyfriend, Michael McCarthy, fatally injured Bella, and that she died weeks before her body was found in a trash bag washed up on the beach. Amoroso said Bond told him that McCarthy kept reminding her afterward that Bella was a \"child of Satan.\" \n \nAmoroso says he believes Bond has told him the truth and he doesn't believe she would have harmed Bella. \n \nProsecutors and police announced Friday that McCarthy, 35, has been charged with murder, and Bond, 40, as an accessory after the fact. Both are to be arraigned Monday. \n \nMcCarthy's attorney, Jonathan Shapiro, declined to comment Sunday on the case except to say that he expects McCarthy, who has been hospitalized, to be in court Monday. \n \nBond's attorney, Janice Bassil, did not immediately return a message Sunday seeking comment. \n \nProsecutors have said they'll wait until the arraignment to release further details.", "source": "Sault Star Online"}
