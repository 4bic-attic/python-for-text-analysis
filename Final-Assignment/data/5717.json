And a handful of those banks \u2014 including HSBC, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BNP, and Standard Chartered \u2014 are expected to shrink in size and start focusing more on their most profitable parts. \n\nThat can only mean good things for the US banks, which are expected to step in to the gaps their rivals leave behind. \n\nHere's how that will look: \n\nUS firms are already gaining share in equities and investment banking this year. \n\nMorgan Stanley Global Insight \n\nUS banks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan are gaining market share in equity sales and trading at the expense of European rivals. \n\nMorgan Stanley Global Insight \n\nUS banks are taking over in traditional investment banking activities like mergers and acquisitions and equity and debt capital markets, too. They've seen a 3.5% jump in investment banking market share, while major European banks have seen a similarly sized drop. \n\nMorgan Stanley Global Insight", "source": "Connecticut Post"}
