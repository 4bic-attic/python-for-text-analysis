Her honeymoon may have been less than relaxing, but Skye Boyd n\u00e9e Denison is still high on marital bliss with her new husband, Wally. The fact that their family is about to get bigger is even more exciting, even if Skye is dealing with morning sickness\u2014and trying to hide the news from her ever-meddling mother, May. But Skye quickly comes crashing down from cloud nine when the body of one of her coworkers, science teacher and volleyball coach Blair Hucksford, is found in the school swimming pool. The troublesome trainer was on the bad side of almost everyone on staff and many of the girls on her team, leaving Skye to sort through a huge roster of suspects. Now she must figure out which wronged party was mad enough to kill, and quickly\u2014before someone else in town gets bumped off. . . . ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Denise Swanson has worked as a school psychologist for 17 years. She lives in Illinois with her husband, Dave, and their cool black cat, Boomerang.
