For the past couple of months, as I've walked the Crosscut Canal banks between 64th Street and 68th Street, I've noticed large snails (1-2 inches in diameter) on the canal sides. I've never noticed them in the past. Do you happen to know why they are in the canal? \n\nThere are all sorts of creatures living in the Salt River Project canals. Most of them aren\u2019t really supposed to be there, and some can be especially troublesome. \n\nThere are a number of snails and mussels in the canals and most are invasive species. They got into the canals mostly because people have dumped them from ponds or aquariums. There are island apple snails, which are about the size of a golf ball. \n\nMy favorite is the Chinese mystery snail because that\u2019s a cool name for a snail. I\u2019m not sure why it is a mystery, but there you have it. It also is about the size of a golf ball. It first appeared in the canals in 2005. \n\nAnd there are red-rim melania, a snail first found in the canals in 1995. The especially troublesome quagga mussel has been moving through the state\u2019s waterways, including the SRP and Central Arizona Project canals for several years. They are very small and can clog water intakes. \n\nAll this is why SRP periodically drains and dredges stretches of the canals, after wrangling the fish to safety. You know how some portions of the canals are covered with small shells? Those are clams \u2014 Asian clams, I think \u2014 that have been dredged from the canals and dumped on the banks. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1KAdPfB", "source": "AZCentral.com"}
