The last time they started a season with back-to-back losses was 2003, according to the Bears' official Twitter account . \n \nThe 2003 season was Dick Jauron's last as head coach of the Bears. Chicago didn't get its first win until Week 4 that year. The '03 Bears would go on to finish 7-9, and Jauron would be fired after the season. \n \nAfter losses to the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals in Weeks 1 and 2, the Bears' first season under new head coach John Fox is starting to look like a disaster. As low as they sunk, the team's two previous coaches -- Marc Trestman and Lovie Smith -- never experienced a two-game hole to start the season. \n \nFox has his work cut out for him, as his Bears try to salvage their season after a slow start. \n \n(h/t Chicago Bears )", "source": "FOXNews.com"}
