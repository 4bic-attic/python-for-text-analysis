The department is also directing its civil and criminal lawyers to work together in all corporate matters, and says corporate investigations will begin with a focus on individuals. \n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates is expected to discuss the changes in a speech in New York on Thursday. \n\nThe department in the last year and a half has reached multi-billion-dollar civil settlements against several banks and brought criminal charges against others. But it has faced criticism that it has not prosecuted enough Wall Street executives, including after the financial crisis.", "source": "Minneapolis Star Tribune"}
