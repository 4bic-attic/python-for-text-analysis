They are my gold mine. I have Anabelle Hydrangea and Gold Flame Spirea among many others. The Gold Flame Spirea is just a phenomenal plant. It is easy to propagate and it sells like crazy. You can grow it in a bed or in containers. \n \nAnnabelle Hydrangea \n \nContainer area with thousands of plants \n \nYou can see the difference in profit between growing several hundred plants in a bed or a thousand plants in containers in basically the same amount of space.\u00a0 Like I said, it is easier to sell 10 plants at $5.97 than one at $39.00 or more. \n \nOf all the plants I have, I am running very low on Gold Mound Spirea.\u00a0 The members in the Backyard Growers Business Center sold out of every Gold Mound Spirea plant and I couldn\u2019t buy any more.\u00a0 Good for them! \n \nWatch this movie me and Duston made explaining the math of growing plants.", "source": "Mike's Backyard Nursery"}
