But ANC legislature members vowed to \u201cvigorously\u201d oppose the high court motion. \n\r \n\u201cThis process has already begun and we will leave no stone unturned in defending the integrity of the institution as a component of the three arms of government with a distinct constitutional mandate,\u201d Limpopo legislature deputy speaker Lehlohonolo Masoga said. \n\r \nThe battle between Ramadwa and the ANC has been ongoing for months and Ramadwa has refused several requests made to her by ANC leaders to step down. \n\r \nThe disgruntled Ramadwa defied the party\u2019s senior leadership, including Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha\u2019s call, and remained defiant to the instruction to step down. \n\r \n\u201cThe court order is to the effect that the legislature is interdicted from proceeding to debate the motion whose notice was tabled during the sitting on August 27, 2015 and nullifying the decision of the House to adopt such a motion,\u201d said Masoga. \n\r \nMasoga said the fact that the court order sought to amend the ruling of the Presiding Officer and hinder the legislature from executing its constitutional mandate. \n\r \n\u201cWe therefore wish to indicate that we will vigorously oppose the matter in Court,\u201d said Masoga. \n\r \nIf the ANC wins, it will use its majority to pass the motion. \n\r \nEFF Limpopo Chairperson Mike Mathebe said they were not against Ramadwa\u2019s removal but against the violation of legislature rules and procedures. \n\r \nANA", "source": "IOL"}
