Head coach Pete Carroll acknowledged as much when addressing the media post practice on Wednesday: \"He's not here and he's not playing,\" Carroll said, via NFL.com. Without Chancellor, Dion Bailey will start at strong safety, and the coaching staff is optimistic he will play well after a strong training camp and preseason. \"Dion Bailey has had a great offseason,\" Carroll said, via NFL.com. \"We feel very comfortable. He's a playmaker and a very aggressive tackler. We're going to count on him to do the things he does well.\" No Chancellor certainly hurts the Seahawks secondary, but Carroll believes the team is well-prepared to succeed in his absence.
