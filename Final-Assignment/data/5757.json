Monday morning, Anthopoulous provided an update on Tulowitzki\u2019s status along with a realistic timeline. \n \n\u201c(Troy) is doing great,\u201d Anthopolous said on Sportsnet 590 The Fan. \u201cI talked to the doctor before our game and he was amazed how fast this guy is starting to progress. \n \n\u201cPeople have talked about Baltimore, but I think that would be real early. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s smart for us to let him get to that point, but we\u2019ll see here in the next few days,\u201d Anthopoulos said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that (he\u2019ll play) in Tampa at some point. Whether it\u2019s the last two games or the last three, that could be the case. He could be back at that time.\u201d \n \nhttp://pmd.fan590.com/audio_on_demand-3/Alex-Anthopoulos-with-Dean-Blundell-and-George-Rusic-db-20150928-Interview.mp3 \n \nTulowitzki, who batted .232/.314/.368 with five home runs in 39 games with Toronto, has not played since cracking his left shoulder blade on Sept. 12 in a collision with outfielder Kevin Pillar at Yankee Stadium. \n \nSorry, this video is not available in your country/region. \n \nWhile Tulowitzki\u2019s status has been a talking point around the Blue Jays organization, one issue that hasn\u2019t been discussed is the future of pending free-agent pitcher David Price . \n \n\u201cI think David (Price) and his agent know we\u2019d love to have him,\u201d the Blue Jays GM said. \u201cBut at the same time we told him when we acquired him that we\u2019re not here to start talking about your free agency and you\u2019re here to help us win so we\u2019re here to make it comfortable for you. That\u2019s been the goal. The more comfortable he is, the more he enjoys it and there\u2019s a likelihood he\u2019s going to perform a lot better. \n \n\u201cI can say this without having talked to anybody specifically, (but) I would have to think that David would strongly consider us but that\u2019s just me. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone and he hasn\u2019t told me that, but I would think he\u2019d consider us. You still need to be competitive from a contractual standpoint. I\u2019ve said it before, but we\u2019d love to have him.\u201d \n \nAnthopoulos said Price has been an excellent addition to the clubhouse and is beloved by everyone in the organization, but the Blue Jays GM believes his free-agent decision will ultimately come down to something former pitcher Roy Halladay once said: free agency is all about choosing where you want to play. \n \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a guy like Price or one of these really marquee free agents, you\u2019re going to get paid regardless, so it does come down to choosing where you want to play,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose have to be the separators. I think the fans, the support and the electricity of the atmosphere, the vibe, and all the support staff in the organization, plus being in a great clubhouse with great teammates \u2014 all those things bode really well for us.\u201d \n \nThe Blue Jays enter Monday\u2019s play with a 90-65 record and have a four-game lead over the New York Yankees in the AL East division.", "source": "Sportsnet.ca"}
