It happened Thursday morning in the city of Ghazni, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Kabul. \n\nEnsafi says authorities are investigating but believe the Taliban are behind the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility but the Taliban frequently use roadside bombs to attack government officials and security forces. \n\nAlso Thursday, Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said in a statement that fighting between Taliban and security forces in several provinces has left 94 Taliban dead in the past 48 hours. The statement says 12 Afghan army troops were killed by roadside bombs and other Taliban attacks.", "source": "LocalNews7.com"}
