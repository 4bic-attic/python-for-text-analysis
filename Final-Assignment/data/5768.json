Should residents of Weston have concessionary parking within a radius of the town centre and seafront?\u201d \n\nAnita B was a fan of the idea and said: \u201cThat would be a good idea. Just to take the dog for a walk on the beach costs \u00a35, (which is) a lot of money to do it everyday.\u201d \n\nRock Star also liked Caroline\u2019s suggestion, and said: \u201cAs a resident I liked to pop up to the seafront for a bit of exercise and a light refreshment, but North Somerset Council\u2019s parking charges are now until 10pm. \n\n\u201cMost other resorts stop their charges at 6pm.\u201d \n\nTrevor S suggested: \u201c(It is an) excellent idea, but it should be applied to all residents whose council charges go towards the upkeep of Weston town or seafront. That would be fairest.\u201d \n\nAnd Caroline D returned to the thread by saying: \u201cCouncil tax-paying residents should be considered for a discounted parking system. After all, we are here all year round so we can provide an income to the council for 12 months consecutively, unlike school holiday visitors.\u201d", "source": "Weston Mercury"}
