Can't Look Away is the story of Torrey, a 16 year old blogger who found fame on the Internet sharing her beauty tips. \u00a0What the public sees of Torrey is one side, but in her private life she is dealing with the death of her younger sister just a few months ago. \u00a0She feels a great deal of guilt and doesn't know how to cope with the changes in her family. \u00a0When her family packs her up and moves her across the country, Torrey hopes she can remain anonymous because strangers online are saying very cruel things about her. \u00a0As Torrey gets to know a local boy whose family owns the local funeral home, she starts learning more about death and the Mexican tradition of el Dia de los Muertos or The Day of the Dead. \u00a0Torrey starts to explore her own feelings about death and how she can mourn the death of her sister. I couldn't stop reading this book. \u00a0It was sad and hard to read at points, but I could see so many of my students in Torrey. \u00a0Even just dealing with the whole idea of being famous on the internet and the different ways people respond to complete strangers in the comment section makes this book an important one to read. Watching how Torrey and her family deal with the loss of her sister also makes this book quite compelling. \u00a0I really enjoyed it. \u00a0", "source": "whatchareading"}
