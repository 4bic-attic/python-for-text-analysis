At their core, EPTs are \"momentum-based beings,\" individuals physiologically and cognitively attuned to the sensation of moving forward, and negatively affected by constraint. Charfen and his organization have pioneered training and methodologies around the EPT to create and sustain positive momentum for businesses and individuals. \n\nAbout Thursday Night Boardroom \nThe Thursday Night Boardroom brings together entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to address unique challenges encountered in business and life. The goal is to leverage the collective wisdom of the group to help its members make significant level jumps in their progress to improve and better their current situations.
