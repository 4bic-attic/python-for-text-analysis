We went outside. \u00a0It was really good. \u00a0I didn\u2019t find it cold, but it was windy. \u00a0She was kind enough to follow me to VW and then drove me to the North Mansion so I could pick up an extra vehicle. \u00a0It was nice to have an extended visit with her as well as hitching a ride to the north end. \n \nMom made dinner for me while dad and I were outside cutting some wood. \u00a0I didn\u2019t do anything. \u00a0I reaped all the benefits. \u00a0I had a free dinner that I didn\u2019t help with (it was delicious!) and I got wood cut and I just stood outside. \u00a0I am thankful for both favors and for the use of their vehicle. \u00a0I get super stressed about getting to work on time and the shuttle does not guarantee that I will get any where fast in the morning. \n \nTerry texted me today that she is five years cancer free. \u00a0That is so great! \u00a0I am thankful for her good health. \n \nJudy, Brittany and I had flamenco tonight. We like the class, but the lady instructor is odd and doesn\u2019t really get how to teach the steps. \u00a0She knows her stuff, but isn\u2019t quite skilled in describing the steps to us. \u00a0Most every dance works on an eight count. \u00a0Flamenco is on a 12 count. \u00a0The counting starts on 12 and often ends on 10. \u00a0This is a little tricky and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the beat. I have to remind myself that I don\u2019t need to be an expert after only two classes. \n \nI was intrigued that The Muppets premiered on tv tonight. I tuned in and sadly was disappointed. It wasn\u2019t interesting or funny. I witnessed Kermit (who clearly has a new voice) and Miss Piggy break up :-(", "source": "Trish Dishes It Out"}
