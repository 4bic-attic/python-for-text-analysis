The British documentary marked the return of Asif Kapadia to the director\u2019s chair for his first feature film since the huge success of Senna back in 2010. Amy saw him return to the documentary genre to explore the life and the career of the iconic singer. Amy will be out on home release at the beginning of November and we have an unseen clip from the film for you to take a look at: Amy tells the incredible story of six-time Grammy-winner Amy Winehouse \u2013 in her own words. Featuring extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks, this strikingly modern, moving and vital film shines a light on the world we live in, in a way that very few can. A once-in-a-generation talent and a pure jazz artist in the most authentic sense, Amy wrote and sung from the heart using her musical gifts to analyse her own problems. The combination of her raw honesty and supreme talent resulted in some of the most original and adored songs of the modern era. Her huge success, however, resulted in relentless and invasive media attention which coupled with Amy\u2019s troubled relationships and precarious lifestyle saw her life tragically begin to unravel. Amy is released on DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital Download on Monday November 2nd.", "source": "Female First Blog"}
