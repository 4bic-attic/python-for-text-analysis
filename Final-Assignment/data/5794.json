The only way to solve this problem is by a united European response and that means sharing responsibility for appalling suffering,\" he said. \n \n\"This is a humanitarian crisis that Europe has not experienced in our time of a dimension which demands a common response. \n \n\"At the moment it is true to say that a number of countries are massively bearing the burden of this.\" \n \nWhile Mr Sutherland said Germany, Sweden, France and Italy were among those doing their bit, the Government spokesman insisted the UK was also playing its part. \n \n\"These photos are clearly shocking. This is why we continue to be at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria - including as the second biggest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid, having already pledged \u00a3900 million,\" the spokesman said. \n \n\"In addition to this financial support, we have granted protection to almost 5,000 Syrians since the crisis began and continue to tackle the organised trafficking gangs seeking to profit from this human misery.\" \n \nThe boy - seen lying face down on the shore - was reported to be one of a group of at least 12 people who drowned when their flimsy boats collapsed as they headed for the Greek island of Kos. \n \nHe was named in Turkish media reports as Aylan Kurdi who fled last year with his family from the besieged town of Kobane to escape the advance of Islamic State militants. \n \nHis five-year-old brother, Galip, and their mother, Rhian, were also reported to be among the dead. Their father, Abdullah Kurdi, was said to have survived. \n \nThey were reported to be among a group of 23 people who set off in two boats from the Bodrum peninsula in Turkey early on Wednesday in an attempt to make the hazardous crossing to Greek territory. \n \nOnly nine are thought to have survived, while two are believed to be still missing. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nJustin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said: \"This tragic image of a little boy who's lost his life fleeing Syria is shocking and is a reminder of the dangers children and families are taking in search of a better life. \n \n\"This child's plight should concentrate minds and force the EU to come together and agree to a plan to tackle the refugee crisis.\"", "source": "Thurrock Gazette"}
