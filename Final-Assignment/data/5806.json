That was part of as 12-hit, four-walk attack that allowed Chicago to gain on both the Cardinals and the Pirates in the division. Addison  Russell , batting ninth, drove in three runs with a homer.  So the two table setters provided the power today.  The Cubs are just two games out of the first wild card and home field advantage in that game.  With the Pirates loss today, they are just 35-34 on the road, so the Cubs would do well to pass Pittsburgh in the race.", "source": "baseballmusings.com"}
