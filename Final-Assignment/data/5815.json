This is only the first step on a very long march.\u201d \n \nMr Blowers said he would be writing to EDF Energy, the Chinese nuclear groups and the Government to reiterate concerns about the site, including the inability to cool water, the delicate nature of the estuary and the disposal of waste. \n \nHe has previously described the scheme as a vanity project for the Government and claimed the Blackwater Estuarywould be trashed if the Chinese were given the green light to run a nuclear power plant. \n \nThe site next to the old power station, which is being decommissioned, is owned by EDF Energy and is a \u201cplanned site\u201d for nuclear development. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nChancellor George Osborne said the Hinkley Point deal \u201copens the door to majority Chinese ownership of a subsequent nuclear project in Bradwell\u201d. \n \nHe brushed aside concerns about the safety of Chinese-designed reactors, insisting any facility built in the UK would have to be signed off by British safety experts.", "source": "Maldon & Burnham Standard"}
