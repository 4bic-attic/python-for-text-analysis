\u2013 \n \nClinton has been criticized for using a private server rather than an official government domain for all her emails during her time at the State Department. \n \nCritics allege that she used the so-called \u201chomebrew server\u201d \u2014 physically located at a private Internet provider \u2014 to avoid political scrutiny of her time as the top US diplomat. \n \nThey also charge that she put national security at risk by taking classified information out of supposedly secure government systems and putting it onto an unauthorized network that could be prey to hackers. \n \nClinton, for her part, insists none of the mails on the private server was formally marked \u201cclassified\u201d nor any higher designation such as \u201ctop secret.\u201d \n \nIf the probe reveals that classified or secret information was shared on un-secured networks or with individuals without a security clearance, Clinton or her staff could face legal consequences. \n \nToner confirmed that the review, being overseen by the Intelligence Community Inspector General, has so far found no mails directly marked \u201cclassified.\u201d \n \nBut while the material reviewed so far was not marked \u201cclassified,\u201d the number of mails containing sensitive information that are now in hindsight thought worthy of classification is on the rise. \n \n\u2013 \u2018Thorough scrub\u2019 \u2013 \n \nToner added that the latest declassification, added to previous such publications, brought the proportion of mails released or redacted as classified to more than 25 percent. \n \n\u201cThe goal is, we do a thorough scrub on whether these need to be redacted before they can be released publicly,\u201d he said. \n \nThe mails that were released \u2014 some of them banal, some cryptic, some heavily redacted and some potentially enlightening \u2014 did not immediately throw up any proof of wrongdoing as reporters began to scan them. \n \nBut the mails do show that Clinton\u2019s team was deeply interested in media coverage of the secretary and her work \u2014 regularly sharing articles both critical and favorable \u2014 and that they were in regular touch with outside friends and consultants. \n \nCritics will be keen to discover if the mails shed any light on suggestions that the secretary\u2019s government work was too entwined with that of the wealthy Clinton family foundation, set up by Clinton\u2019s husband, former president Bill Clinton. \n \nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that the latest release of emails was further proof of a \u201creckless attempt to skirt transparency laws.\u201d \n \n\u201cWith the FBI continuing to investigate, Hillary Clinton\u2019s growing email scandal shows she cannot be trusted with the White House,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nNumerous Republicans have pressed Clinton for more information about the email server, claiming she may have used the private account in order to keep it out of the public record. \n \nClinton sent or received a total of 62,320 emails during her term as secretary between 2009 and 2013. \n \nShe provided 30,490 official emails to the State Department for release to the public record, while declaring that her own office has deemed the remaining 31,830 to be personal records. \n \nAll of Clinton\u2019s official correspondence, minus information deemed secret and then redacted by the State Department or intelligence agencies, is scheduled to be released by January. \n \nIn late July, Clinton said she was \u201cconfident\u201d that she \u201cnever sent or received any information that was classified at the time.\u201d \n \nShe remains the frontrunner to be named the 2016 Democratic contender for the White House, but pollsters say the email scandal has dented public trust in her. \n \nThe post Thousands of Clinton emails released, scores retroactively classified appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria .", "source": "The Guardian Nigeria"}
