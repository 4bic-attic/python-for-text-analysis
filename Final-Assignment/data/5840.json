She loves Paul Newman, she\u2019s a fly swing dancer, and she has one of those special phones designed with XXL buttons. She\u2019s amazing, but I possibly wouldn\u2019t describe her as hip . \n \nBaddieWinkle, on the other hand, is a granny who is way, way cooler than I will ever be. Formerly known as\u00a0Helen Van\u00a0Winkle, Baddie\u2019s motto these days is \u201cStealing your man since 1928.\u201d \n \nSometime in her mid-80\u2019s, Winkle decided that she only had so much time left, and she should use it to have all of the irresponsible fun that \u2018Helen\u2019 never had. Thus, the alter-ego \u201cBaddie Winkle\u201d was born. \n \nThe now-87-year-old first became interested in the hipster look\u00a0when her great-granddaughter introduced her to an aesthetic best described as \u201craver chic,\u201d not unlike these trippy yin-yang nails . Kennedy Lewis, 19, left clothes lying around, and came home to discover that grandma had borrowed her cut-offs and tie-dye tee for some afternoon sunbathing. \n \nLewis thought the accidental ensemble was so cute that she began lending Winkle more of her clothes. Eventually, they set up an Instagram ( which LittleThings.com has covered in the past ) and Twitter feed, both of which feature Baddie rocking her favorite looks. She\u2019s gained a huge following, and these days, Baddie can even count celebs like Miley Cyrus among her fans. \n \nThese days, the octogenarian can often be found wearing her favorite HOMI\u00c9S beanie, or rocking a 90s-goth tattoo choker. She is a visible advocate for the legalization of marijuana, though she doesn\u2019t smoke it herself. She \u201cloves\u201d her Drake shirt. Check out her closet tour with Refinery29 to learn more about her impressive wardrobe! \n \nAnd if you\u2019re inspired by this stylish granny hipper than most kids, please SHARE with everyone who knows that age is just a number! \n \nThe post BaddieWinkle Is The 87-Year-Old Grandma Who Became An Instagram Style Star appeared first on LittleThings.com .", "source": "LittleThings.com"}
