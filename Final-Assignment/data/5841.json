I knew I wanted to eventually buy an office building here.\u201d \n \nThe Law Office of Patricia Garcia Billings remained in a rented property on First Street until finally a building on historic Main Street was put on the market. When the building became available, Billings took a chance and made the purchase. \n \n\u201cI wanted to renovate the building in the old style to go with the area,\u201d Billings said. \u201cI enjoy history, and I wanted the building to look older but be new. I really love this place. I live in Kingwood and have always wanted to practice in a small town. I like the idea of how the practice was back in the day, like in the 40s and 50s. I want my practice to be like that. I\u2019m kind of sentimental in that way.\u201d \n \nRenovations began in May 2015 and were scheduled to be completed in July. Unfortunately, the project was set back due to weather but still managed to come together in the first week of August. \n \nThroughout this process, Billings paid for the project out-of-pocket. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t seek financial help,\u201d Billings said. \u201cI feel like this building is my child. I\u2019ve been so excited, telling people \u2018Come and see my building,\u2019 and I\u2019m sure that my friends on Facebook are thinking, \u2018If she posts one more picture of that building\u2026\u2019\u201d \n \nHowever, no such attitude was evident at the building\u2019s open house Thursday, Sept. 10. Almost 100 people packed into Billings\u2019 new law office to celebrate with margaritas, food and live mariachi music. Friends and family showered Billings with gifts to show that they, too, shared her pride in the successful renovations. \n \n\u201cI make friends easily and stay friends,\u201d Billings said. \u201cI\u2019ve known a lot of the people here (at the grand opening) since my childhood. I\u2019m very grateful to all of the people who stand by me. I\u2019ve gotten to know so many people here.\u201d \n \nBillings practices family, probate and family-based immigration law. As an attorney, Billings takes pride in the integrity of the cases she takes on. She likes the fact that in a small town, attorneys are held to a standard of morality that is not always adhered to with larger urban firms. \n \n\u201cRelationships are very important to me,\u201d Billings said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I wanted to practice in a small town. I want people to know me and trust my reputation. It\u2019s about building that trust. You can\u2019t build those kinds of relationships practicing in a big city.\u201d \n \nThe Law Office of Patricia Garcia Billings location in Humble is located at 407 E Main Street. \n \nFor more information, visit http://www.lawofficeofpatriciabillings.com/ .", "source": "Lake Houston Observer"}
