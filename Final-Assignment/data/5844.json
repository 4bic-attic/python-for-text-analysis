That was one of the other issues cited in the story, with the two being \u201cprofessional\u201d but not all that close. Hoiberg also touched on the hotel room incident in his interview. \n   \nJamie Pollard on KXNO-AM in Des Moines now, said somebody's \"got an axe to grind\" and feels sorry for Travis HInes because \"he got misled.\" \n \n\u2014 Mike Hlas (@Hlas) September 30, 2015 \n \n   \nPollard said apparently someone is jealous someone (ones) they aren't on the ISU bkb staff anymore and other people are. \n \n\u2014 Mike Hlas (@Hlas) September 30, 2015 \n \n   \nHoiberg: \u201cI have absolutely zero issues with how he (Pollard) ran our basketball program.\" \n \n\u2014 Chris Williams (@ChrisMWilliams) September 30, 2015 \n \n   \nHoiberg: \u201cI saw something about rooms in Hawaii\u2026\u201d \"We had to find 5 hours of stuff to do in Hawaii. Big deal.\" \n \n\u2014 Chris Williams (@ChrisMWilliams) September 30, 2015 \n \n \nWhile that may not seem like a big deal,\u00a0being used as a reason for the increase in prices \u201cconcerned\u201d Hoiberg according to the story. And given the fact that he grew up in Ames, that\u2019s certainly an understandable concern to have. \n \nWith Hoiberg having moved on, the question now is how this will all impact Steve Prohm as he looks to pick up where \u201cThe Mayor\u201d left off. While on the court the talent is there for Prohm to have an immediate impact in his first season as head coach, financial support will factor into the efforts to make sure Iowa State basketball is successful for years to come. \n \nAnd if there are issues between the administration and the head coach, that task becomes far more difficult. \n      More Coaching Change Analysis     Coaches on the Hot\u00a0Seat      Key assistant coaching\u00a0hires      \nThe college basketball coaching carousel was in full effect last spring, as 40 head coaching positions changed hands. Of those 40 jobs, 12 major high major programs will enter this season with a new man in charge while six more teams that would be classified as mid-major plus had turnover in leadership. \n \nHere are the coaches in the best position to succeed immediately, and those that will likely need some time before they see the kind of success they\u2019re used to : \n \nCOACHES BEST SET UP FOR IMMEDIATE SUCCESS \n Steve Prohm, Iowa State : With Fred Hoiberg making the move to the NBA, someone was bound to land a job coaching a team with the talent needed to play deep into the NCAA tournament. Prohm was the pick for Iowa State after a successful run at Murray State, and with players such as Monte Morris, Georges Niang and Jameel McKay, his first season in Ames can be a special one.  Will Wade, VCU : Yes, Wade has some personnel losses to account as the former Shaka Smart assistant\u00a0returns to VCU; most notably, Briante Weber and Treveon Graham have graduated. The cupboard isn\u2019t bare either, however, as Melvin Johnson is back for his senior year, as are JeQuan Lewis and Mo-Alie Cox. Look for the Rams to once again be a factor in the Atlantic 10 race. (And yes, I know my opinion differs from some of my colleagues.)  Tim Duryea, Utah State : Duryea\u2019s definitely familiar with the USU roster, as he served as the now-retired Stew Morrill\u2019s assistant for 14 seasons. And he\u2019s got a good roster to work with, with all five starters returning led by forwards Jalen Moore and David Collette. Utah State exceeded expectations by finishing fourth in the Mountain West a season ago; they\u2019ll be expected to contend this time around and have the pieces to do just that.  Mike White, Florida : Like Prohm, White arrives at his new gig after experiencing a lot of success at his last stop.\u00a0But unlike Prohm he\u2019s taking over for a coach in Billy Donovan took Florida\u2019s program to heights never before reached in the history of the program. There\u2019s some talent to work with, especially if he can get Kasey Hill going, and White also managed to hold onto most of Florida\u2019s 2015 recruiting class.  Ben Howland, Mississippi State : While Howland\u2019s resume surpasses that of any other coach on this list, and he\u2019ll have Malik Newman at his disposal, that doesn\u2019t overtake the fact that there\u2019s a lot to be done with a program that struggled mightily in the three seasons prior. Howland put together a good recruiting class led by Newman, but if there\u2019s a concern it\u2019s the health of his front court (that wasn\u2019t all too deep to begin with).  Matt McCall, Chattanooga : McCall\u2019s first head coaching gig at the Division I level has the potential to be a very successful one, thanks to the talent due back on campus. Four starters, including guard Casey Jones and forward Justin Tuoyo, return from a team that won 22 games and finished 15-3 in SoCon play.  Eran Ganot, Hawai\u2019i : Last season began with tumult for Hawai\u2019i, but interim head coach Benjy Taylor was able to lead the Rainbow Warriors to 22 wins and a run to the Big West tournament final. Now former Saint Mary\u2019s assistant Eran Ganot takes over an experienced group that returns three starters (seven who started at least two games) led by Big West Defensive Player of the Year Roderick Bobbitt.  \nMORE : 2015-16 Season Preview Coverage | Conference Previews | Preview Schedule \n AP Photo \nNEW HEAD COACHES WHO\u00a0NEED SOME TIME \n Shaka Smart, Texas :\u00a0A key\u00a0question for some is how Smart\u2019s pressure system will mesh with bigs who are best equipped to play in the half court. However the biggest issue in Smart\u2019s first season at the helm in Austin is the strength of the Big 12, with perennial favorite Kansas leading what should be a deep race. There\u2019s still talent, enough to make the tournament, but contending in the Big 12 may take a little time.  Rick Barnes, Tennessee : Barnes has relocated to Knoxville, where he\u2019ll aim to rejuvenate a program that dealt with the Donnie Tyndall investigation (and ultimately, firing) for much of last season. Three starters return but the one true difference-maker, Josh Richardson, isn\u2019t among those players. Add in a lack of size in the post, and this could be a difficult season for Barnes in an SEC that will be improved.  Avery Johnson, Alabama : Johnson and his staff have made some waves recruiting-wise, most notably reeling in Terrance Ferguson, and that certainly bodes well for the future. However, when it comes to this season he inherits a roster that lost its top three scorers from a season ago. That could prove difficult to overcome in a league that\u2019s improved from last season.  Chris Mullin, St. John\u2019s : To say that Mullin and his staff were left with a bare cupboard would be an understatement. Two of the remaining players (Chris Obekpa and Rysheed Jordan) didn\u2019t exactly mesh with the new staff\u2019s plans, so they moved on. The work done by Mullin and assistants Barry Rohrssen and Matt Abdelmassih to fill out the roster will help St. John\u2019s in the long run, but this season could be a difficult one.  Brian Wardle, Bradley : Wardle\u2019s move from Green Bay to Peoria, Illinois is a big one for a Bradley program that struggled in a big way under Geno Ford. Given Wardle\u2019s accomplishments he\u2019s got a good chance of turning things around. But it\u2019s going to take some time to do so, especially with just one starter from last season\u2019s nin win team back on campus. There was a lot of turnover on the roster, so the Braves will take their lumps as a result.  Bobby Hurley, Arizona State : Hurley put together two successful seasons at Buffalo before making the move west, and he inherits a roster doesn\u2019t lack for\u00a0experience. In a similar situation at Buffalo in 2013-14, he led the Bulls to 19 wins and had the MAC Player of the Year in Javon McCrea. The two\u00a0issues this time around: while the Pac-12 may not have a dominant team as it did a season ago (Arizona) it is deeper, and the Sun Devils will have to navigate a tough non-conference slate as well.  Dave Leitao, DePaul : Since Leitao\u2019s first run at DePaul came to an end in 2005, the Blue Demons have struggled mightily. Now he returns to the Windy City, and while there is some talent (Billy Garrett Jr. being one option) there\u2019s a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0making a move up the Big East standings and being a true factor in the conference.       More on Coaching Changes     Coaching Changes: Who\u2019s set for success, failure      Key assistant coaching hires      \nAs we get closer to the start of the 2015-16 college basketball season, let\u2019s take a look at the head coaches who need to have a good season in order to feel safe. While the list of coaches on CBT\u2019s \u201chot seat\u201d have had poor seasons and lost their jobs before, keep in mind that the last two No. 1 selections for this list kept their jobs the following season, including Maryland coach Mark Turgeon, who is currently thriving in College Park.\u00a0 \n \n1. Tom Crean, Indiana : Indiana enters the 2015-16 season with top-25 talent and high expectations, but Crean finds himself atop the hot seat list for failing to meet expectations at Indiana. Crean\u2019s now entering his eighth season as the Indiana head coach, and only once in the previous seven seasons \u2014 the 2012-13 season \u2014 have the Hoosiers been good enough to be considered a true title contender. That\u2019s not enough, but not only is\u00a0Crean struggling to find the success the Hoosier fan base craves on the floor, but the dismissal of three more players this offseason hasn\u2019t made life any easier off the floor. Indiana\u2019s president isn\u2019t pleased with the off-the-court developments and many prominent Indiana alums have been vocal about the Hoosiers falling below expectations. A big season would go a long way towards quieting Crean\u2019s doubters. \n \n2. Josh Pastner, Memphis : \u00a0 Much like Crean at Indiana, Pastner has achieved success but faltered compared to a passionate\u00a0fan base\u2019s expectations. Memphis missed the postseason altogether for the first time in 15 years with last season\u2019s 18-14 record and the team\u2019s best returning player, Austin Nichols, transferred to Virginia, following Nick King and Pookie Powell out the door. Pastner is going to rely heavily on the freshman Lawson brothers to make a postseason appearance immediately, but in a city that became accustomed to the success of John Calipari\u2019s Tigers, will they be satisfied if we\u2019ve already seen Peak Pastner ? \n \n3. Brian Gregory, Georgia Tech : \u00a0 After a 12-19 season and 14th place finish, Gregory is back for his fifth season at Georgia Tech. He\u2019s never finished above ninth in the ACC. Gregory has coached one team to the NCAA tournament in his last 11 seasons and that came at Dayton in 2010. The local recruiting momentum is also limited for Georgia Tech under Gregory. The Yellow Jackets went 0-for-7 recruiting prospects from Georgia in the Rivals150 in the Class of 2015. In the Class of 2016, that number is 1-for-11. \n \n4. Kevin Willard, Seton Hall : \u00a0 Entering his sixth season at Seton Hall, Willard has finished above .500 twice and owns a 30-60 mark in the Big East. Having never made the NCAA tournament as a head coach, the pressure is on Willard to produce even though experienced guards Sterling Gibbs and Jaren Sina both transferred out of the program. \n \n5.\u00a0 John Groce, Illinois : Illinois missed the NCAA tournament in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1992 and that isn\u2019t sitting well with Illini fans. Groce has never finished above seventh in the Big Ten and he hasn\u2019t been able to reel in a lot of big-named recruits that Illinois finds itself a finalist for. Transfers like Darius Paul and Aaron Cosby haven\u2019t lasted and proved to be harmful as replacements for those missed recruits. Illinois fans expect results and Groce needs to make the NCAAs again. \n \nMORE : 2015-16 Season Preview Coverage | Conference Previews | Preview Schedule \n Illinois head coach John Groce () \n6.\u00a0 Barry Hinson, Southern Illinois : \u00a0 The once proud Southern Illinois program has had to endure Hinson\u2019s three-year tenure. He\u2019s thrown his own players under the bus during a postgame press conference and publicly remarked about his job security this spring . The Salukis own a 40-57 record and 19-35 mark\u00a0in conference play under Hinson and he lost five transfers this offseason, three of them freshmen. \n \n7.\u00a0 Donnie Jones, UCF : \u00a0 UCF was successful in Conference USA, but its been a rough back-to-back stretch for the program. Jones has never made the NCAA tournament and his 2010-11 wins were vacated for using ineligible players. Jones was also suspended three CUSA games and the program put on probation. Now he\u2019s 25-36 overall and 9-27 in the American the last two seasons. \n \n8. Travis Ford, Oklahoma State : \u00a0 It\u2019s never a good sign when the team\u2019s athletic director and biggest public booster, T. Boone Pickens, publicly have to back Travis Ford , which is precisely what happened in Stillwater this offseason. It\u2019s a far worse sign that Ford owns no NCAA tournament wins since 2009 despite recruiting McDonald\u2019s All-Americans like LeBryan Nash and Marcus Smart, who both played for multiple seasons. \n \n9. Dave Rice, UNLV :\u00a0Rice has proven to be a formidable force on the recruiting trail, but that success has yet to translate on the Thomas and Mack Center court, as the Rebs have missed the last two NCAA tournaments. Rice was feeling the heat a little bit this offseason when rumors of Ben Howland looking at UNLV began swirling, but Howland is now at Mississippi State and Rice landed hometown\u00a0McDonald\u2019s All-American Stephen Zimmerman. Rice still doesn\u2019t own any NCAA tournament wins, and with yet another talented recruiting class, he needs a strong season. \n \n10. Kim Anderson, Missouri : \u00a0 Anderson\u2019s first season at Mizzou was a disaster as the team went 9-23 and 3-15 in the SEC. It\u2019s not looking much better in the future as the Tigers lost some key pieces \u2014 namely Jonathan Williams III and Teki Gill-Cesear \u2014 to transfer.", "source": "NBC Sports"}
