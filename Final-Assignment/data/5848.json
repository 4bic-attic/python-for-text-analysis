Mass, two stages with music, contests, a raffle and more open up several options for fun this weekend.

Listen to a different side of the Lafayette Symphony Orchestra\u2019s personality \u2014 one that features small groups of musicians in a laid-back, nightclublike setting in an intimate venue downtown.

Ticket packages and more information at lafayettesymphony.org .) \n\n3. KISS TRIBUTE. A quick look at photos from KIST\u2019s past concerts reveals those silver and black costumes, platform boots and wild makeup. In other words, the tribute band prides itself on emulating the trendsetting hard rock band that first claimed fame in the late 1970s. Jon Lightning (lead guitar), Mikal Paul (rhythm guitar), Nash (drums) and The Demon (bass guitar) sing favorites largely from the make-up era. With 3 Point Zero.
