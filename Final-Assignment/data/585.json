Here in Northern California, we\u2019d had a stretch of triple digit temperatures, with no relief in sight. Last Saturday by late afternoon the air was hot, dry and charged with static, and a strange wild, wind kicked up out of nowhere. The fire energy was palpable. The next day we got the news: Lake County was burning and it was bad. As the reports come in of the enormous devastation, I\u2019ve felt completely helpless. Lost houses, lost lives, lost pets. Desperate pleas on Facebook posts with photos and telephone numbers, seeking word of loved ones, animals and any updates about homes and neighborhoods. Today I was finally able to help in some small way by delivering much needed supplies for horses and livestock to the Fairgrounds. What I witnessed stunned me. What you\u2019re not seeing in the media reports are the hundreds of tents that are currently set up outside the Napa Fairgrounds, housing families and animals of all kinds. Think mini-Katrina with livestock and assorted four-leggeds. As someone who\u00a0survived\u00a0a fire evacuation in 1994 in Colorado, the\u00a0Storm King Fire, one worst fires in history, the one that apparently, \u201cwrote the manual\u201d for firefighting going forward\u201414 firefighters lost their lives, trying to save our community\u2014I understand first hand what it feels like to wonder if you have seen the last of your home, your pets and your possessions. The words anxiety and grief don\u2019t cover it. I was living in a log cabin surrounded by BLM wilderness, when fire season started\u00a0that summer\u2014an annual and inevitable event. I made a list of things I would take with me in case a fire broke out. I don\u2019t know why I did that; I\u2019d never done it before. I set it on my desktop, so I wouldn\u2019t have to \u201cthink\u201d about it if the time came. When it came\u00a0down to it, there were only five\u00a0things on that list, all of them deeply personal and of enormous sentimental value. It\u2019s interesting when it comes right down to it what\u2019s important to us,\u00a0really. Shortly after writing the list, I left Colorado to attend my grandmother\u2019s funeral in Florida. It was literally during her ceremony when the phone started vibrating off the hook. My heart started to pound; I knew something was terribly wrong. The phone rang again, I looked down and saw my husband\u2019s number, I left the funeral parlor and walked outside, relieved to know he was alive, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry, I\u2019m fine and I have the dog, the fire has exploded, we\u2019ve been evacuated, I took what I could.\u201d The words hit me like a Mac truck. It started\u00a0from a lightening strike, initially burning only three\u00a0acres. When it touched down, it found exactly what it needed to grow and spread. By the time it overran the fire line jumping the highway and the riverbed, it had trapped and killed 14 courageous men and women and engulfed one side of our town. It was 4 days after that initial strike that the fire began climbing the hillside behind our home. As he sat in his truck out of harms way, on the other side of town, my husband described orange-red flames shooting 100 feet in the air licking the top of the ridgeline, above our home. That\u2019s the trouble with fire. It doesn\u2019t stay put. It\u2019s a moving target and the laws of nature will take it where it wants to go. I still have no idea how those men and women stopped that fire where they did. When I returned home to see the fires path and the charred remains of homes, trees and the land, it seemed nothing short of a miracle. There are really no words that can accurately describe the feelings of gratitude I have for those who put their lives on the line every day in this way. We were lucky that year, \u201cspared,\u201d we were told, but somehow, you don\u2019t feel that way, when you carry in your heart the weight\u00a0of 14 lives\u00a0and so many others\u2014friends and neighbors\u2014who weren\u2019t as \u201cfortunate.\u201d As I drove home after dropping off the donations, I had time to process what I witnessed at the Fairgrounds, Revisiting the tents, tarps and mountains of donated clothing, in my minds eye, it hit me again: life can change in an instant. And then last night the rains came. On any other day it would have been cause for huge celebration. The water so critically needed, yet under the circumstances so brutal and unfair. These folks have been through so much, they didn\u2019t need to spend a cold, wet night outside.\u00a0It\u2019s not a small thing to become homeless overnight and lose everything you\u2019ve treasured, your livelihood\u2026and your beloved pets. This is the definition of trauma.\nAs I head back to the fairgrounds to offer support, I am counting my blessings and grappling with the duality of life. Survivor\u2019s guilt is\u00a0a heavy burden. \u00a0 \u00a0 If you feel called to help in any way here are a few credible ways to do so: \u00a0 Local Donations Directly to the Cause Redwood Credit Union Emergency Evacuation Resources for Lake County Red Cross/Santa Rosa Chapter \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Author:\u00a0Sheri Gaynor Editor: Ren\u00e9e Picard Image: Wiki Commons\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Wake-Up Call Newsletter\rGet elephant's Daily Wake Up Call: a gap for inspiration & meaning in the inbox of your mind\rIncorrect source, offensive, or found a typo?
