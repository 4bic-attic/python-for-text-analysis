Adam Hine's 21-yard touchdown run cut the deficit to 17-14 with 4:32 remaining in the third quarter. \n \nBut the Broncos had an answer. \n \nThey quickly drove 86 yards on six plays, and regained control when McNichols took a screen pass 29 yards for a TD with 2:03 left in the third. \n \nBYU had to punt, but Nacua's second interception and return to the BSU 12 rescued the Cougars early in the fourth quarter. After a wild sequence of penalties on both teams erased a touchdown and then gave BYU life after a would-be sack, Mangum's 1-yard sneak cut Boise State's lead to 24-21. \n \nBYU's go-ahead drive started on its own 36 yard line with 3:33 remaining. Mangum was sacked on second down and then threw an incomplete pass to the end zone before the connection with Juergens. \n \nBYU's only offensive highlight in the first half came on the game's third play. \n \nMangum picked up where he left off against Nebraska, throwing the home to Juergens to give the Cougars a quick 7-0 lead on their first possession. The freshman rolled right on third-and-19 and found Juergens alone behind the coverage. \n \nIt was the fifth-longest pass play in BYU history. \n \nMangum went to the well again after the Cougars took over near midfield, but his bomb was picked off by Donte Deayon. \n \nThe Broncos got on the board with 4:13 remaining in the first quarter by driving 52 yards. Jeremy McNichols capped it off with a tackle-breaking 3-yard touchdown run.\r \n\r \r \");\r\n\t}", "source": "Salt Lake Tribune"}
