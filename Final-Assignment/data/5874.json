All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words \"expect\", \"will\", \"may\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the company or the other Offerors in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property, and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; and our ability to successfully complete transactions. Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements. \n\nThe Offerors disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. \n\nContacts: \n\nINVESTOR CONTACT: Susan Muir \n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations \n\n(416) 307-5107 \n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Andy Lloyd \n\nSenior Vice President, Communications \n\n(416) 307-7414 \n\n\u00a9 2015 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
