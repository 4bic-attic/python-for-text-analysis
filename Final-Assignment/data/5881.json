That seems to be all some humans can do at their zoo. Is that called denial or living in the past without a clue? Beats the heck out of me. But I'll show you the error of you ways at your sea.\nWhat if it went that way.\nWhat if that was on display.\nWhat if I did that.\nWhat if I were a cat.\nWhat ifs do flow.\nWhat ifs do show.\nWhat ifs in the know.\nWhat ifs you crow.\nWhat if I turned.\nWhat if I learned.\nWhat if I flew.\nWhat if that were true.\nWhat ifs high.\nWhat ifs don't die.\nWhat ifs aplenty.\nWhat ifs of 2020.\nWhat if I fell.\nWhat if there's hell.\nWhat if I walk.\nWhat if I talk.\nWhat ifs north.\nWhat ifs put forth.\nWhat ifs south.\nWhat ifs have growth.\nWhat if-ed out?\nWhat if I end my shout?\nWhat if I stop right now?\nWould you have a cow?\nWhat if that were true.\nThat would hurt you.\nOut pops a cow.\nThe world record book would wow.\nNow what if you are in plot A,\nWishing for plot B at your bay.\nNow what if you were in plot B,\nWould you be wishing for plot A at your sea?\nDid you grasp that?\nWhat if I'm not really a cat.\nWhat if I'm a dog.\nWhat if I say pffft to that final log.\nDo you get it now? All done what if-ing and having that cow? If you what if about situation B while in situation A, still following at my bay? Then you'd most likely, what if about situation A if you were in situation B. You humans are never satisfied at your sea. Now the deep thinking has come to pass from my what if-ing little rhyming ass.\nFill your rummer, get drunk all summer.", "source": "It's Rhyme Time"}
