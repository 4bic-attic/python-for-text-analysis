David Gilmour is looking pretty good for number 5 with projected sales of 68,000 to 73,000 followed by Shinedown (63,000 to 68,000), Ryan Adams (50,000 to 55,000), Andy Mineo (35,000 to 40,000), Keith Richards (28,000 to 32,000) and Alabama (25,000 to 30,000).\nThe real question here is Ryan Adams\u00a0who didn't even have an album in the running until the digital release of his Taylor Swift cover album 1989. \u00a0Snuck out on Monday, the Swift via the Smiths album seems to have struck a chord and is getting glowing reviews, so it could end up with even higher sales.\nChris Cornell's Higher Truth\u00a0is also projected just outside the top ten 15,000 to 19,000 in sales.\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook", "source": "VVN Music"}
