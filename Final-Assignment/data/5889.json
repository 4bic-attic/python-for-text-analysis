But the government has had difficulty applying it to company insiders who have permission to access a computer, but then abuse that right. \n \nThe concerns aren't new, but they've attracted attention this year after President Barack Obama suggested changes to the law as part of a broader cybersecurity package. \n \nThe Senate is expected to take up cybersecurity measures soon, but it's not clear if lawmakers will address the problem.", "source": "Chicago Daily Herald"}
