So it is still open whether it will go one way or the other,\" Vestager told a news conference. \n \n\"We looked into the case before we formally opened it and of course the reason why we put quite a lot of resources into it is because we have concerns if things are as they should be, if totally by the book.\" \n \n(Reporting by Gilbert Reilhac, writing by Philip Blenkinsop)", "source": "92.9 WLMI"}
