But dwelling on what you\u2019ve (or shouldn\u2019t have) done only makes things worse. Here\u2019s how you can get over your remorse and move on. \n\n \nIf you have ever felt guilty for having ruined your diet and health efforts from a weekend of get-togethers, \u201ccheat\u201d meals\u2014or essentially meals that focus on the pleasurable foods you enjoy\u2014and otherwise uncontrollable eating and/or drinking, congratulations, you are human and living life. \n \nWe often feel this way because we hold ourselves to an unfair standard of perfection (\u201cI\u2019m going to stick to this diet no matter what !\u201d) and then feel like we\u2019ve failed for not meeting this ideal ( and consequently, self-sabotage ). I know I\u2019ve been there plenty of times and used to beat myself up for my seemingly lack of self-control and discipline. \n  \n   \nhttp://vitals.lifehacker.com/reframe-cheat-... \n  \nThen I realized reprimanding myself probably only helped repeat the cycle of losing self-control and feeling depressed afterward. Other than being more compassionate towards yourself , a good way to ease the guilt and anxiety is to reframe the consequences of the cheat meal (or day) from the short-term to the long-term by asking: \u201cWill my overeating or drinking affect me a day or week from now? Or maybe even a month or year from now?\u201d \n \nChances are you\u2019ll realize the answer is no to most, because one night of terrible eating/drinking isn\u2019t likely going to affect your long-term health or weight loss goals, as long as you consistently practice good habits at other times. \n\n \nhttp://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-importance... \n  \nWhen you view these weekend binge-fests over a month, a year, or your entire life, you further realize these occasional (keyword: occasional) events are really small blips on life\u2019s radar but can offer liberating mental breaks from the day-to-day of healthier living. \n \nOn the flip side, if you\u2019re debating as to whether you should  partake in gluttonous or inebriated merriment, take the longview again and ask, \u201cHow will this make me feel tomorrow or all week?\u201d This question can give you a good reality check of knowing yourself and how much you should or shouldn\u2019t indulge. \n \nImage by Evil Erin .", "source": "Lifehacker"}
