CABS which is monitoring raptor migration and illegal hunting on Malta and Gozo since 11 September has so far observed and reported three incidents of shooting of protected birds to the police. The victims are a Short-toed Eagle, a Hoopoe and the Eurasian Spoonbill found near Salini last week. Apart from these cases the birdwatchers observed \u201ca significant decrease of incidents which involved shooting at or of protected birds as well as observations of birds with visible shotgun injuries.\u201d \u201cThe times of the big massacres are over. We now have to deal with the criminals who still think that they are above the law,\u201d CABS president Heinz Schwarze said. CABS has also posted a video of what its volunteers described as a \u201cbold attempt to hit and kill a highly protected species!\u201d \u201cThe two hunters appeared to be a pair of Peregrine Falcons. The Harrier was not hurt either!\u201d CABS Press Officer Axel Hirschfeld reports. It seemed that the Falcons acted jointly to defend their territory \u2013 a behaviour which would confirm reports of local Ornithologists stating that the \u00b4Maltese Falcon\u00b4 is on the comeback. To ensure the safety of the rare birds CABS decided not to publish the location of the site.
