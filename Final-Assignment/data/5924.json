Now, I have been asked to represent the UWI Vice Chancellor\u2019s Celebrity XI and I immediately agreed to participate in aid of such a worthy cause.\u201d \n\nProceeds from the match go directly to the Dominica Government to assist with recovery efforts in the island which suffered severe damage to property and loss of life from the passage of Tropical Storm Erika, and continued to be affected by heavy rainfall in the recent days. \n\nAmbrose retired from international cricket 15 years ago with 405 Test wickets and 225 in One-Day Internationals. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind sending down an over of two for such as worthy cause,\u201d said Sir Curtly, who celebrated his 52nd birthday on Monday. \n\n\u201cI was very touched when I heard the news and then saw what happened on television. \n\n\u201cI knew the storm had passed and then I heard they had a lot of rain, but initially I didn\u2019t realize the devastation. I saw the clippings and it was really a tragedy. We all have to play our part to help rebuild the country, hence the reason why I decided to be part of this fund raising event\u201d. Each side is expected to field half-dozen current players from the West Indies team currently preparing for next month\u2019s Tour of Sri Lanka and a number of celebrity players. \n\n\u201cGenerally, I am expecting a very good game and I want to urge all the fans in Barbados to fill the Oval on Saturday night,\u201d said Ambrose. \n\n\u201cI also want to encourage those not in Barbados to make donations through other means, so the people of Dominica can get back on their feet as quickly as possible.\u201d", "source": "Stabroek News"}
