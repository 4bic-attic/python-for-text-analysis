She had a little, soft trial on Tuesday and is bang on for this race.\n\n\u201cPrincefamous has won four of his five starts, he has got ability and is going great but this is his toughest task.\n\n\u201cBounding was very good first-up at Caulfield and this is a nice race for her, even though she has topweight.\n\n\u201cNancy was a bit stiff first-up at Canterbury, she had to go one pair back on settling than I would have liked and that was the difference between winning and losing.\u2019\u2019\n\nR1: RANVET HANDICAP (1800m)\n\nTrainer Kris Lees says Artibai is ready to win, Rio Perdido is a big improver and Slivovitz could be saved for Sundays\u2019 Dubbo Gold Cup. This was how Lees summed up his three acceptors and the bookies agree, rating Artibai the $5 favourite.\n\n\u201cArtibai hasn\u2019t had a great deal of luck in his previous two starts but he is racing in good form,\u2019\u2019 Lees said. \u201cIf he gets any luck from the wide gate, he is going to be in the finish. We have the \u2018Magic Man\u2019 (Joao Moreira) to help us.\n\n\u201cRio Perdido is starting to get there. He is improving with each run after having a couple of years off, his head is back in the game.\n\n\u201cSlivovitz ran well in the Taree Cup and the form has stood up from that race. I\u2019ll try and work out whether Rosehill or Dubbo suits him best but he\u2019s an honest horse, holding his form.\u2019\u2019 Source: News Corp Australia \n\nR2: KINGSTON TOWN STAKES (2000m)\n\nGodolphin\u2019s John O\u2019Shea revealed there were genuine excuses for former English stayer Havana Cooler\u2019s flop in the Wyong Gold Cup last Friday.\n\n\u201cHavana Cooler lost his action going around the bend early in the race,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Shea said. \u201cHe got a bit \u2018disconnected\u2019 and lost all his rhythm.\n\n\u201cI thought he should have been beaten 20 lengths but was only beaten about six and when he came back in, his heart rate was only about 80 so it was like he didn\u2019t even have a race.\u2019\u2019\n\nHavana Cooler created a big impression at his Australian debut prior to Wyong where he flashed home for sixth to Beyond Thankful at Rosehill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keen to back up with him because he hasn\u2019t turned a hair since Wyong,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Shea said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be going into The Metropolitan off that Wyong run.\u2019\u2019\n\nR3: TAB.COM.AU HCP (1500m)\n\nDanish Twist may never emulate the deeds of her half-brother, $3 million earner Happy Trails, but she has got her race career off to a good start.\n\nAs Happy Trails chases a fourth Group 1 success in the Makybe Diva Stakes at Flemington on Saturday, Danish Twist is aiming for her fourth win in seven starts at Rosehill.\n\n\u201cDanish Twist has plenty of upside and is improving every time she goes to the races,\u2019\u2019 Lees said. \u201cI thought her Wyong win was pretty soft (last Friday) and there is no reason not to back-up with her at Rosehill. She is ready to step up to metropolitan class now.\u2019\u2019\n\nR4: MACK TRUCKS HCP (1200m)\n\nFell Swoop\u2019s impressive win at stakes level at Moonee Valley last week has franked the Music Magnate form.\n\nMusic Magnate resumed with a game second to Fell Swoop at Randwick three weeks ago and trainer Bjorn Baker said the four-year-old will strip fitter on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a big opinion of him and his first-up run was good,\u2019\u2019 Baker said. \u201cHe handles all sorts of track conditions and he is a lot more adaptable these days than he was as a younger horse.\n\n\u201cHe only had one barrier trial going into Randwick so I decided to give him another trial last week and he went very well. I believe I have him right where I want him for this race.\u2019\u2019 Source: Supplied R5: SHERACO STAKES (1200m)\n\nSam Clipperton is sure of one thing \u2014 Peeping won\u2019t stop trying when she takes on glamour mares Bounding and Catkins.\n\n\u201cPeeping gives her all every start,\u2019\u2019 the jockey said. \u201cThis is a very tough race but she is very well, (trainer) Ron Quinton has this mare in great shape.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeeping showed her courage and determination to run down Howmuchdoyouloveme in an exciting first-up win at Rosehill a month ago.\n\n\u201cShe had to run down a tough sprinter first-up and it showed me she has come back very well,\u2019\u2019 Clipperton said. \u201cThis mare appreciates being on the fresh side, too.\u2019\u2019\n\nR6: GOLDEN ROSE (1400m)\n\nHall of Famer Ron Quinton doesn\u2019t believe Let\u2019s Make It Rain is deserving of rank outsider status in the first Group 1 race of the Sydney spring carnival.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying he will win but he\u2019s going to run a very good race,\u2019\u2019 Quinton said. \u201cHe is a lovely colt with the best attitude.\u2019\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s Make It Rain is $31 for the Golden Rose but, as Quinton pointed out, the three-year-old has good consistent form.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t beaten far in the Rosebud and then he ran a good second at Rosehill when he had to give the winner (Wudang Mountain) 3kg. If the barriers had been reversed that day, I feel he would have beaten the winner.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s racing well and I feel he is entitled to his chance in this race.\u2019\u2019\n\nR7: THEO MARKS STAKES (1300m)\n\nTye Angland has described his booking for Ninth Legion as a \u201csuper pick-up ride for Team Hawkes\u201d.\n\n\u201cNinth Legion has only had one trial and will improve but he is a good horse and usually sprints well fresh,\u2019\u2019 Angland said. \u201cHe has the \u2018soft\u2019 barrier and he is right in the mix.\u2019\u2019\n\nNinth Legion did win the Carrington Stakes before finishing second to Godolphin\u2019s boom galloper Contributer in the Apollo Stakes at his first two runs last autumn and if he runs up to that form, then the gelding is a good each-way chance. Source: News Limited \n\nThe Hawkes stable also has Messene and Nostradamus among the main chances, while Godolphin is relying on Vashka.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned about the level of speed in this race because Vashka likes to lead and roll along,\u2019\u2019 trainer John O\u2019Shea said. \u201cBut he has had four starts at Rosehill for four wins and he\u2019s done everything right going into this race.\u2019\u2019\n\nR8: TAB REWARDS HCP (1400m)\n\nNancy, a daughter of Kentucky Derby winner Big Brown, is a mare with considerable potential, according to trainer Peter Snowden.\n\n\u201cShe has had four starts and shown something a bit special in each,\u2019\u2019 Snowden said. \u201cHer sectionals are very good and she hits the line hard. She looks to be in a race to suit her and from the nice gate, I hope she is in first five or six and give herself every chance.\u2019\u2019", "source": "NEWS.com.au"}
