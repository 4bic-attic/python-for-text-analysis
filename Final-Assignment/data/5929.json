Nationally, while the actual number of students earning a composite score of 36 varies from year to year, on average, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of students who take the ACT earns the top score. Among test-takers in the high school graduating class of 2014, only 1,407 of nearly 1.85 million students earned a composite score of 36. \n  \nThe ACT consists of tests in English, mathematics, reading and science. Each test is scored on a scale of 1-36, and a student's composite score is the average of the four test scores. Some students also take ACT\u2019s optional Writing Test, but the score for that test is reported separately and is not included within the ACT composite score. \n \nIn a letter recognizing this exceptional achievement, ACT CEO Jon Whitmore said, \u201cWhile test scores are just one of the many criteria that most colleges consider when making admission decisions, your exceptional ACT composite score should prove helpful as you pursue your education and career goals.\u201d \n \nACT test scores are accepted by all major U.S. colleges. Exceptional scores of 36 provide colleges with evidence of student readiness for the academic rigors that lie ahead.", "source": "Allen American"}
