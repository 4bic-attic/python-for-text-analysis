Another fact about this is that economy, lies and false reports are being used to do our nations harm and it will not be strange that someone might, in the near or far future, change the proxy wars regionally going on into direct ones, and then all tricks will be exposed and masks will fall off so many faces. \n \nThis coming war, if it takes place, will contribute to remapping the whole region for good, creating sectarian and racial \u2018statelets\u2019 demarking their borders with blood, in addition to endless regional instability. In other words, it will lead into a state of hot permanent Middle East Balkanization, substituting European Balkanization that has, for centuries, been the source of continuous wars there. Preparations for a third Gulf war have already started with lies similar to that of Saddam\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, including accusing a GCC state (Saudi Arabia) of being behind OPEC\u2019s unanimous decision to maintain the current oil production rates as is, but those behind the lie forget that this particular state\u2019s share of OPEC production is no more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s entire oil production, and that OPEC decisions are made by the political leaderships of member states. \n \nSo, can KSA impose a decision on other OPEC members like Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Nigeria, Qatar, Ecuador\u2026etc?! Our Arab countries started this century as Middle East\u2019s \u2018Sick Men\u2019 while international and regional countries are competing to divide and share all its fortunes exactly the way they did with the Ottoman Empire that was dubbed as Europe\u2019s \u2018Sick Man\u2019 by the beginning of the 20th century. I would finally like to highlight that there will be no winners in a third Gulf war \u2013 everyone will lose! \n \n\u2014 Translated by Kuwait Times from Al-Anbaa \n \nBy Sami Al-Nisf", "source": "Kuwait Times"}
