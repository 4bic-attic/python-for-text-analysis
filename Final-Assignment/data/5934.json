The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.\n\nI\u2019d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.\n\nThere are even financial contracts that are antifragile: they are explicitly designed to benefit from market volatility.\n\nIt is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it. Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurableRead more at location 354\n\nwe can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.\n\nCrucially, if antifragility is the property of all those natural (and complex) systems that have survived, depriving these systems of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them. They will weaken, die, or blow up. We have been fragilizing the economy, our health, political life, education, almost everything \u2026 by suppressing randomness and volatility.", "source": "Lost Ferry"}
