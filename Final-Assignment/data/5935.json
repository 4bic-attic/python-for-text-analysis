The math test, for instance, only covers 8th grade-level material and can be passed if students answer 55 percent of questions correctly.\u00a0About\u00a080 percent\u00a0of California high schoolers take and pass it on their first try while in the 10th grade, and overall passage rates\u00a0for the class of 2014 were above 97 percent. \n \nBut now, a bill passed Thursday by the California legislature, which Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign, suspends the exam through 2018, while also retroactively\u00a0suspending it back to 2004. That means thousands of students who failed to ever pass the exam but otherwise completed all other requirements will now be able to receive diplomas. \n \nAccording to SFGate ,\u00a0about 40,000 people will benefit from the change by becoming newly eligible to graduate. The number could be higher, though, as\u00a0 249,000 students failed to pass\u00a0the test \u00a0by the end of senior year from 2006 to 2014. \n\nRead more from The Daily Caller", "source": "1360kmjm.com"}
