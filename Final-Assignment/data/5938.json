This enables laboratories to operate the MassARRAY System largely unattended for high-throughput, multiplex genetic analysis.\n\n\"Automation of the post-PCR workflow reduces labor and helps to improve the quality and consistency of genetic testing. Laboratories can focus resources on the most impactful work,\" said Peter Dansky, Agena Bioscience's CEO. \n\nThe Chip prep module is designed to minimize hands-on time and reduce the risk of cross contamination associated with manual sample handling. It automates several processing steps, including dispensing and desalting samples onto the SpectroCHIP Array, and subsequently loading these onto the MassARRAY Analyzer. \n\nHigh throughput laboratories can capitalize on the quick load-and-go process of the Chip prep module. \n\nSouth Bend Medical Foundation, an early access site, has realized many of the benefits of the MassARRAY System in their clinical laboratory. \"The flexibility to refine complicated testing methods quickly and easily has made the MassARRAY System an integral part of our molecular testing,\" said Bobbie Sutton, MD, pathologist and director of molecular pathology. \n\nThe Chip prep module can process eight 96-pad SpectroCHIP Arrays in less than a day and it includes on-board cooling and storage, which allow overnight processing and storage of two additional SpectroCHIP Arrays. The module is an add-on to the MassARRAY Analyzer.", "source": "Advance for Administrators of the Laboratory"}
