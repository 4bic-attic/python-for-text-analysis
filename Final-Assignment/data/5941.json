The summer of 2015 has found me taking a forced hiatus from riding due to a condition called Dupuytren\u2019s Contracture.\u00a0\u00a0 In older men of northern European extraction (I have to cop to at least two of these three characteristics), oft times the fascia which overlays and protects the tendons which allow the fingers to flex and/or straighten, shrinks up \u2013 contracts \u2013 disallowing the tendons to do their job.\u00a0 In my case, the crook in my right pinkie made it impossible to put on riding gloves.\u00a0 ATGATT: No Gloves = No Ride. Repair for this malady involves removal of a section of the uncooperative fascia. A very worthy surgeon at my local Kaiser undertook this operation.\u00a0 When I awoke from anesthesia, my throttle hand was casted and wrapped.\u00a0 It would remain so for two weeks.\u00a0 I guess I can go without riding for two weeks, I thought to myself. Those fourteen days dragged by and when the wraps came off, it turns out that my expectations had been a little vigorous.\u00a0 It would be at least another two (more than likely four) weeks until my palm fully knitted and I could competently and safely operate a motorcycle. To add a tiny bit of insult to this injury, it seems the incision necessary for removing the fascia has to be of a zigzag design so as to protect the route of the still working tendon.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been told to remove the dressing daily to inspect and clean the thing, which I do.\u00a0 On one of these routine inspections, it struck me:\u00a0 My surgeon had carved a map of that glorious Italian road right into the palm of my hand! Thanks Doc!\u00a0 When I do get over there, I\u2019ll not need GPS to find my way across Stelvio Pass.\u00a0 But I will have to slip off those gloves. \u00a9 2015 Church of the Open Road Press", "source": "The Church of the Open Road Press"}
