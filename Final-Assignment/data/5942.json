Do it yourself  \n  \n Image copyright \n \n \nImage caption \n\nFarmers are crying out for faster internet connectivity, says the National Farmers\u2019 Union \n\n\nRural communities, fed up with snail\u2019s pace internet connectivity and lacklustre progress by private telecoms companies, have been building their own broadband networks. \n \nOne such initiative, Northamptonshire-based Tove Valley Broadband (TVB), was set up by volunteer locals after they realised that faster internet speeds were not arriving any time soon. \n \nThe not-for-profit group engaged installation company Fibre Options to lay fibre optic cables in trenches dug by a local land drainage contractor. \n \n\u201cIn the last year I\u2019ve done a hell of a lot of walking across fields looking down holes,\u201d says Peter Watkins, TVB\u2019s technical director. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s kept me active.\u201d \n \nThe group \u2013 after much effort \u2013 has succeeded in bringing internet speeds of more than 30 megabits per second (Mbps) to 457 people so far, says Mr Watkins. \n  \n Image copyright \nTove Valley Broadband \n \nImage caption \n\nHuge trenching machines can dig and lay cable at the same time \n\n \n Image copyright \nTOVE VALLEY BROADBAND \n \nImage caption \n\nThe Tove Valley Broadband volunteers tidy up after another fibre optic cable has been buried \n\n\nDomestic scheme members pay \u00a3100 to join, a \u00a375 installation fee, then \u00a3120 a year. \n \nAnother project, Broadband for the Rural North , has been laying fibre optic cables right up to the backdoor of rural homes in Lancashire, given them blistering \u201chyperfast\u201d download speeds of up to 1,000Mbps. \n \nThe service costs \u00a330 a month for residential users after a \u00a3150 connection fee. \n \nHard-to-reach  \n\nBroadband Delivery UK, the body tasked by the government to roll out its \u00a3780m National Broadband Scheme, has been giving funding to a handful of such community projects, but the total currently stands at less than \u00a35m . \n \nThe Scheme aims to provide 90% of UK premises access to \u201csuperfast broadband\u201d of at least 24 megabits per second (Mbps) by 2016, and to reach 95% of premises by 2017. \n \nBut many people in rural and \u201chard-to-reach\u201d areas have been excluded from this first implementation phase and are still making do with a fraction of those speeds. \n \nAccording to UK telecoms regulator Ofcom, the average UK broadband speed was 22.8Mbps as of November 2014. \n \nWhile rural speeds averaged a third of that, some remote areas are making do with speeds as low as 1Mbps. \n \nIt\u2019s frustration at these glacial speeds that has prompted some local communities to take matters in to their own hands. \n \nFundamental right  \n\nRoger Carey is director of Village Networks , a community broadband initiative that was successful enough to become a self-supporting enterprise. \n \nHe believes that an adequate internet connection is a fundamental right. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to say to people: \u2018You\u2019ve chosen to live in a remote rural environment, satellite broadband is your only option \u2013 it\u2019s very expensive, it\u2019s technologically unsatisfactory, but you\u2019ve got to live with it\u2019. That\u2019s an inappropriate response. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why those people should suffer an unsatisfactory alternative to the internet people in cities and towns have,\u201d he says. \n  \n Image copyright \n \n \nImage caption \n\nSome farmers feel they\u2019re stuck in the past when it comes to communications technology \n\n\nFor farmers, connectivity is also becoming increasingly important to their business. \n \n\u201cThe response from our members is that they aren\u2019t getting access to the signal that they need and want,\u201d said Suzanne Clear, a senior adviser at the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU). \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s really important for their business, but it\u2019s also really important for their social life, their wellbeing, and for contacting doctors and schools. Everything now is sent out by email and they haven\u2019t got that access.\u201d \n \nThe NFU\u2019s other concern is that UK farmers may miss out on agricultural technology advances due to poor connectivity, which could damage the country\u2019s ability to compete globally. \n \nA tale of two fibres  \n\nCritics of the national broadband roll-out plan say the problem likes with the fact that BT mostly provides \u201cfibre to the cabinet\u201d (FTTC) rather than \u201cfibre to the home\u201d (FTTH). \n \nFTTC, as the name suggests, brings fibre optic cables \u2013 which are significantly faster at transferring data than copper cables \u2013 to the BT cabinet closest to you. \n \nThe final leg of the connection then relies on the copper between your home and the cabinet. \n \nBill Murphy, BT\u2019s managing director of Next Generation Access, explained that the company \u201cchose to deploy mainly FTTC technology because it allowed us to reach the most homes and businesses in the fastest possible time. \n  \n Image copyright \nThinkstock \n \nImage caption \n\nTelecoms companies argue that it\u2019s too expensive to install superfast broadband in rural areas \n\n\n\u201cFTTC currently delivers download speeds of up to 80Mbps \u2013 more than enough for today\u2019s consumers.\u201d \n \nIn rural areas, though, the copper connection can be several miles long, and signal strength weakens the further it has to travel \u2013 a process called attenuation. \n \n\u201cThe technology that\u2019s available through the incumbent [provider] is not suitable for rural areas, as has been proven over and over again in every single county,\u201d says Hugo Pickering, chief executive of Cotswolds Broadband . \n \n\u201cFTTC is not a viable technology for rural areas \u2026copper has an effective lifespan and likewise it has a reach which cannot be exceeded due to the laws of physics.\u201d \n \nBT has worked on some FTTH projects, but cost has proven to be a limiting factor. \n \n\u201cTo do this nationwide would have been enormously expensive,\u201d says Mr Murphy. \u201cSome estimates suggest around \u00a328bn.\u201d \n \nUp in the air  \n\nWhere FTTH is too expensive or difficult to put in place, some communities have set up wireless networks, using high gain directional antennae to provide line-of-sight connections over long distances. \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019re a commercial operator, that\u2019s incredibly expensive,\u201d says Professor Peter Buneman, one of the founders of Tegola , a research project helping to provide internet access to small, isolated communities across rural Scotland. \n \n\u201cYou have to put up great big masts, you have to have maintenance contracts, and you\u2019re talking about \u00a3100,000-\u00a3200,000 just to serve a community of 10 people. \n  \n Image copyright \nTegola \n \nImage caption \n\nThe Tegola project in rural Scotland is experimenting with wireless broadband \n\n\n\u201cNo organisation is going to do that. Communities can do it for a fraction of the cost,\u201d he says. \n \nProf Buneman started Tegola \u201cout of sheer frustration,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cIt was quite clear that the government was doing nothing, and BT just wanted to make money. Then people came round asking me how to do it.\u201d \n \nWireless networks are well suited to some areas, but not others. You need to have a fibre optic network nearby to connect to, he says, and the necessity for line-of-sight connection is a limiting factor. \n \nBut community broadband initiatives are perfectly achievable, says Prof Buneman, providing you\u2019re prepared \u201cto roll up your sleeves.\u201d", "source": "Before It's News"}
