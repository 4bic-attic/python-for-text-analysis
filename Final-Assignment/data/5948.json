Many people living with type 2 diabetes remain uncontrolled and it is crucial for these patients to gain control of their blood glucose levels to help prevent further complications from this disease.\u201d \n \nThe most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, which included nausea and diarrhea. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported. \n \nVictoza was launched in the European Union in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 80 countries with over 3 million patient years of use in people with type 2 diabetes globally, notching up sales 8.44 billion Danish kroner ($1.28 billion) in the first half of this year.", "source": "Pharma Letter"}
