Depape is being held in Skagit County Jail on $250,000 bail. \n\nShe is expected to appear in Skagit County Superior Court later this week to enter a plea to the charge. \n\nDepape was driving southbound on I-5 in a 2000 Honda Civic when her vehicle left the roadway near milepost 221, crossed a grass median, traveled underneath a cable barrier and entered northbound lanes, according to court documents. \n\nThe Honda Civic collided with a 1998 BMW 528 being driven northbound by 64-year-old Joseph Gibbons of Issaquah. Gibbons died at the scene. \n\nTwo other vehicles were also involved in the collision. Their drivers, a 42-year-old Oak Harbor man and a 23-year-old Tukwila woman, suffered minor injuries and were transported to Skagit Valley Hospital. \n\nDepape reportedly told a State Patrol trooper that she had her dog loose in the front seat of her car, and the dog crawled beneath her legs just before the collision, court documents state. \n\nDepape was transported to the hospital for treatment before she was booked into jail. \n\nA sample of her blood was taken for toxicology testing after State Patrol obtained a search warrant. Test results are pending. \n\n\u2014 Reporter Evan Marczynski: 360-416-2149, emarczynski@skagitpublishing.com , Twitter: @Evan_SVH,", "source": "GoSkagit.com"}
