Two other men were transported to Kings County Hospital in stable condition. \n\nThe dead worker\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t immediately released. \n\nFDNY Chief John Rozas said three adjoining buildings were in jeopardy of collapse. \n\n\"They were underpinning a foundation, it looks like, and they didn't have it supported properly and the bottom of the wall kicked out and the top tumbled down,\" Rozas said. \n\nChandler said permits were issued in July to build a new five-story residential structure on the site. \n\nThe city Buildings Department had issued a stop-work order on the building almost a year ago. When a permit was granted for the new work, the stop-work order was vacated. \n\n\u201cThe good thing is: People had taken out permits and done the right thing to repair the building,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cThat's what we like to see. Unfortunately, it appears they took more of a risk than they should have doing this excavation.\" \n\nOn Staten Island, a 37-year-old worker fell about 50 feet off a roof at 1111 Victory Blvd. just before 9 a.m. He was taken to Richmond University Medical Center in critical condition. His name wasn\u2019t immediately released. \n\nThe address where the fall took place belongs to Clove Lake Car Service, which operates out of a converted home. Work was being done on the building's siding and the man fell while mounting scaffolding, witnesses said. \n\n\"We didn't even know anything was going on until an ambulance came,\" said a car service dispatcher who declined to give his name. \"He was up on the side of the building when he fell. That's scary.\"\u00a0 \n\n ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE. \n\nWith Greg B. Smith", "source": "DailyNews724.com"}
