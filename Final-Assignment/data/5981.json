The rebels surrendered six pick-up trucks and some ammunition, or about one-quarter of their issued equipment, to a suspected Nusra intermediary on Sept 21-22 in exchange for safe passage, said Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for US Central Command, in a statement.\n\n\"If accurate, the report of NSF members providing equipment to al Nusra Front is very concerning and a violation of Syria train and equip program guidelines,\" Ryder said, using an acronym for the rebels, called the New Syrian Forces.\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, was told of the equipment surrender around 1 pm (1700 GMT) on Friday, Ryder said. Earlier on Friday, Ryder had said all weapons and equipment issued to the rebels remained under their control.\n\nThe news was the most recent sign of trouble in a fledgling military effort to train fighters to take on the Islamic State militant group in Syria, where civil war has killed about 250,000 people and caused nearly half of Syria's prewar population of 23 million to flee.\n\nA top US general told Congress last week that only a handful of the rebels are still fighting in Syria, though US military officials said this week that dozens more have since joined them.\n\nUS officials said a review is underway that could result in scaling back and re envisioning the program.", "source": "Irish Independent"}
