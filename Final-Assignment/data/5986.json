It is one of the largest annual gatherings of HR professionals in higher education; CUPA-HR is considered the voice of higher education human resources. \n \nThis year, PeopleAdmin is a Mary Ann Wersch Premier Partner, CUPA-HR\u2019s highest-level of partnership. \n\u201cWe have worked with PeopleAdmin for many years and are very pleased to acknowledge and celebrate this new level of partnership,\u201d said Andy Brantley, President and CEO, CUPA-HR. \u201cCUPA-HR\u2019s Mary Ann Wersch Premier Partners are industry thought leaders who fully engage with CUPA-HR to help provide essential knowledge and resources to higher education and the higher education human resources community.\u201d \n \n\u201cThis is our 13th year at this event, and we\u2019re excited to deepen our partnership with CUPA-HR and all its members, especially as PeopleAdmin continues to focus on growth to better serve our new and existing customers,\u201d said PeopleAdmin CEO Kermit Randa. \u201cWe welcome this opportunity to help higher education institutions tackle some of today\u2019s top talent management challenges with better technology strategies and solutions.\u201d \n \nAs evidence of its growth, PeopleAdmin in June was selected as a Tyton Growth50 company, placing it among \u201cthe most important growth-stage companies in education,\u201d according to Tyton Partners, a long-time provider of investment banking and strategy consulting for the global knowledge sector. \n \nRanda said that for HR to earn a seat at the executive table, it needs strategic insight and visibility into the entire talent management process, so institutions can use improved reporting and analytics to make better business decisions that support their academic missions. PeopleAdmin\u2019s cloud-based talent management solution, SelectSuite\u00ae, helps HR departments do that. \n \n\u201cWe appreciate the fact that PeopleAdmin is focused on higher education,\u201d said Corrie Mimms, employment consultant, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cWe've seen other products that weren't focused on higher ed, and the functionality we needed just wasn't available.\u201d \n \nAlso, for the third year, PeopleAdmin continues its sponsorship of the HR Innovation Award for developing new and innovative HR models that can be easily adapted by other campuses.
