In fact, the average number of sick days (legitimate and illegitimate) taken has generally been in decline for a number of years. \n\nThe gap is biggest in France, where the consensus is that 40% have pretended to be ill to get a day off work, compared to the 6% that say they actually have. \n\nIpsos Mori also found other types of undesirable behaviour that are not as prevalent as commonly thought include eating too much sugar, not exercising enough and, in Britain at least, people not saving enough for their retirement. \n\nThe average guess by Britons for the proportion of the population that eat more than the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) daily limit of sugar (50g) is 69%, while a separate survey by Public Health England shows it is actually 47%. Ipsos Mori calculated this figure from the report\u2019s data tables. \n\nAcross the six countries, the average guess was that 66% were eating more than 50g a day. However, only 40% thought they were exceeding the limit themselves. \n\nHowever, people in every country underestimated how much exercise the wider population and, by implication, they themselves were probably doing each week. \n\nFor example, in Germany just 39% of those surveyed thought they were reaching the exercise target of walking briskly for at least 30 minutes, five times a week, or doing more vigorous exercises for 20 minutes, three times a week. When asked how many people out of 100 in Germany were meeting this target, the average guess was 37%, but according to a 2", "source": "MyInforms"}
