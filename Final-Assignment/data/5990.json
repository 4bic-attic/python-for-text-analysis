Fortunately, Jackman has weighed in on the debate with his choice for who should don the adamantium claws in his stead in an interview with MTV News.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really given it a lot of thought,\u201d Jackman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked that question a lot, and I\u2019m always like, \u2018I don\u2019t wanna make it too easy on the studio to replace me,\u2019 you know? I\u2019ve still got one more to do. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already talking about it, and there\u2019s some actor [they\u2019ve told] \u2018shh, keep it quiet but we want you next.\u2018\u201d After a bit of thought on who could play a younger, re-imagined Wolverine, Jackman made his choice. \u201cHe\u2019s younger than me for sure,\u201d Jackman said. \u201cI think\u00a0Tom Hardy\u00a0would be a great Wolverine.\u201d Hardy, who is no stranger to the comic book genre thanks to his role as Bane in\u00a0The Dark Knight Rises\u00a0and an upcoming\u00a0adaptation of\u00a0100 Bullets,\u00a0seems to be Hollywood\u2019s choice for any big role with a potential vacancy looming. UK oddsmakers have Hardy as a frontrunner\u00a0to take over the James Bond franchise following Daniel Craig\u2019s eventual departure. Though\u00a0some actors believe others\u00a0could portray the suave spy, and the Internet still seems\u00a0pretty invested in Idris Elba\u00a0for the role. Jackman will star in an upcoming sequel to\u00a0The Wolverine. It\u2019s unknown whether he\u2019ll make cameos in the upcoming\u00a0X-Men: Apocalypse, or impending spinoffs\u00a0Deadpool\u00a0or\u00a0Gambit.", "source": "Welcome To On Point Naija Blog"}
