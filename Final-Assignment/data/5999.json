The six week rule has already been broken in Somerset and Gloucestershire during the first year of culling, when insufficient badgers to meet the 70% target were killed within the period. \n\nDefra reports: \u201cThis experience has shown that more flexibility in the duration of the culling period would provide a greater assurance of achieving the necessary reduction in the badger population.\u201d \n\nConsideration is also being given to reducing the minimum size of an area where badgers can be culled from 150 square kilometres down to 100 square kilometres. The original area was set on the basis of the Randomised Badger Culling Trials but, Defra says, further analysis of the RBCT shows similar results could be achieved across a smaller area. \n\nThe consultation document says: \u201cWhile Somerset, Gloucestershire and Dorset (the additional area licensed this year) are all significantly larger than this proposed minimum size, there may be concentrated areas of high cattle density and infected badger populations less than 150km squared where farmers wish control operations to be licensed in the future. \n\n\u201cBeing clear on the smallest area in which badger removal could take place with the same high confidence of a net beneficial result would be in important in these circumstances.\u201d \n\nThe consultation document also puts forward the suggestion that the requirement that 70% of the land inside any new cull zone should have to be accessible to those engaged in badger control while 90% should either be accessible or within 200m of accessible land. \n\nIt is calling for views on changing the wording to remove the requirement that 70% of the land should be accessible saying it would: \u201cRemove a rigid inflexibility which could prevent and otherwise strong application with marginally less than 70% access to the total land from being taken forward.\u201d \n\nAnd it suggests changing the rule that \u201cat least 90%\u201d of the land should be within 200m of accessible land to \u201capproximately 90%\u201d. The changes would, if agreed, open up a large number of new areas to become potential badger cull zones over the 25 year life of the bTB eradication plan. \n\nAny changes won\u2019t come into force until next year \u2013 when, the National Farmers Union hopes and believes \u2013 further areas, including Devon and Cornwall, will be included in the areas where badgers can be culled. \n\nMeurig Raymond, NFU president, said: \u201cAs this policy is rolled out to more areas in the years to come it is crucial that the model is looked at to ensure it is as simple and effective as possible and less vulnerable to disruption. We hope that the consultation that has been launched on the licensing criteria will begin the discussion about how this can be achieved.\u201d", "source": "Western Morning News"}
