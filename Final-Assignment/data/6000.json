(TSX:ER)  and Darnley Bay Resources Limited (TSX VENTURE:DBL) announced early-staged drilling results for the Lac Lessard project. Two of 10 VTEM targets drill-tested intersected nickel-sulphide mineralization over wide intervals within the Crete-du-Coq ultramafic intrusion. The drill program, funded by Darnley Bay Resources Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:DBL), as part of its first-year work commitment to an option agreement, whereby DBL can earn 50% of the project, consisted of 11 heli-supported\u00a0diamond drill holes for a total of 1,995 metres. \n\nEarly-staged drilling at Lac Lessard has confirmed anomalous nickel sulphide mineralization within the Crete-du-Coq ultramafic intrusion (Table 1). Both targets are open laterally and at depth. Drill hole LL15-02 intersected both disseminated and semi-massive nickel sulphide mineralization; however the basal contact of the ultramafic intrusion, where massive nickel sulphide often occurs in contact with the host country rock, has not been tested. The potential for massive nickel mineralization at Lac Lessard remains positive. \n \nDrill hole LL15-02 collared within the Crete-du-Coq ultramafic intrusion intersected disseminated sulphides over a 12.5-metre interval assaying 0.38% nickel and 0.13% copper. Semi-massive sulphides intersected at the bottom of this interval contain 1.08% nickel and 0.31% copper over a length of 2.5 metres. A five-metre interval of disseminated nickel sulphides containing 0.41% nickel and 0.09% copper was also intersected 126.0 metres down the hole. Drill hole LL15-02 did not reach the lower contact of the ultramafic intrusion, indicating additional potential at deeper levels of the Crete-du Coq. \n\nDrill hole LL15-10 was completed to test a strong airborne induced polarization (IP) anomaly corresponding with a strong magnetic feature. This hole intersected an average of 0.29% nickel across 198.4 metres within a fine-grained, magnetite-bearing ultramafic rock. As with the previous drill hole, LL15-10 did not reach the lower contact of the ultramafic intrusion. This target also remains open. \n \u00a0  Table 1.\u00a0Lac Lessard Assay Results \n \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  Drill Hole  From  To  Length  Ni%  Cu%  LL15-02  91.2  103.7  12.5  0.38  0.13  incl.  101.2  103.7  2.5  1.08  0.31  \u00a0  126.0  131.0  5.0  0.41  0.09  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  LL15-10  16.6  216.0  199.4  0.29  -  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0   \nDr. Donald J.
