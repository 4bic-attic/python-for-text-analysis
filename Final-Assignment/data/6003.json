Not that there is anything wrong about praying, but when you lose sight of your very reason that you went to Cuba it is a problem.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t    \r \nThe Cuban programme is part of national government\u2019s plan of increasing the pool of doctors and the primary beneficiaries are students from poor backgrounds. It is expected that once they complete their studies they will be dispatched to different parts of the country. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t        \t\t    \t\t  \t\t    \r \nEarly last month Dhlomo warned students who were leaving for Cuba from Durban\u2019s King Shaka International Airport to focus on their studies and refrain from excessive partying and praying. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t    \r \nHe was quoted by the Citizen newspaper as saying: \u201cI have received reports of students who have forgotten the real reason why they are in Cuba - reports of students who have formed religious groups and spend all their time praying. I want to warn you that we did not send you there to form churches and become pastors, but to become doctors.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t    \r \nANA", "source": "South Africa Post"}
