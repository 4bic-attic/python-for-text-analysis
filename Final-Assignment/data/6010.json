As part of the project, I am simultaneously preparing it for its annual PCI audit, responding to audits by other organizations for which the company is a key third party, and reviewing organizations that are its key third parties. It seems that with the focus on PCI compliance these days, everyone is auditing everyone else. Despite this, we don't seem to be reducing the number of credit card breaches, or actually making organizations more secure. \n\nAccording to the Verizon 2015 PCI Compliance Report, the number of security incidents is still growing, and at a significant rate \u2013- 66% per year. The same report demonstrates that despite all of the PCI audits happening, most companies are still missing the mark, with 80% failing their interim assessments. Verizon concludes from this that organizations \u201cfailed to sustain the security controls they put in place. \n\n\u201d \n\nI would characterize the interim assessment failures a bit more bluntly \u2013- organizations \"cram\" to pass their annual assessment, and return to business as usual the day after the audit ends. This is the point at which compliance and security diverge. Being compliant does not make one secure, despite passing an annual assessment. Many tier 1 companies, such as my customer mentioned above, get this, but many others, including some top card processors, don't seem to understand. \n\nThis \u201ccheck it off and forget it\u201d approach to compliance can be worse than never being compliant in the first place, because it can lead to a false sense of security. As the Verizon report puts it \u201cdata breaches are rarely \u2018smash and grab\u2019 affairs.\u201d Hackers going after a major company are usually in it for the long haul. So, the company passes its annual certification, at which point, company management, reassured by the audit results, moves on to other things. Procedures gets lax again, and the hackers are there waiting for an opening. \n\nSpeaking about real versus perceived security, the stakes are high, with card fraud losses closing in on $50 billion annually in 2013. In its research, Verizon found that of consumers who suffered data loss as a result of a breach, 69% were less likely to do additional transactions with the company losing their data. Also of concern to organizations subject to PCI is that court precedent on card breaches is shifting financial responsibility from the banks, where it has traditionally resided, to the company responsible for the breach. As an example, a recent federal court ruling on the Target card breach found that banks could seek to recover their losses from Target. \n\nSo how can you be secure and compliant without having to cram for your test? The following are some practical suggestions: \n\nBegin with achievable policies \n\nThe PCI standard allows for a good bit of discretion on how policies are formulated, as long as each objective is achieved. Resist the temptation to write an elaborate policy that you will never be able to follow. Instead, your policy should match the specific needs and abilities of your company. Find as simple an approach as you can come up with, and follow it. For example, I could write a 20-page, comprehensive incident response policy and procedure, or I could create one that was simple and effective at only two pages. The extra 18 pages do not necessarily make it better for you. \n\nKeep notes \n\nIf at any point you are subject to an outside audit, it will be critical for you to demonstrate that you are following your achievable policies (in the compliance world, we call this evidence). The best way to show this is to make\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
