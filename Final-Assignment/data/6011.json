It's always good to get over for your country. \n \n\"I'm just happy we won and we move on to the next game.\" \n \nThe build-up is over and England have just a week to improve on their display before Wales visit Twickenham. \n \nThere was relief and satisfaction among the ranks. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"I don't think you feel the nerves and tension until you step out on the field and all the expectation comes crashing back down on you,\" Vunipola added. \n \n\"It's a home World Cup, first game up against a team with nothing to lose.
