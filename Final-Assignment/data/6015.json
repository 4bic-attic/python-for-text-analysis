Turns out that\u2019s not true. Let\u2019s cut through the misinformation and clear up exactly how Konami is trying to get your money here. Anyone playing through the newest Metal Gear will eventually unlock a feature called Forward Operating Bases\u2014or FOBs. In short, constructing these FOBs will allow players to deploy extra units on combat missions, earning money and resources that can be used to upgrade weapons at Snake\u2019s headquarters, Mother Base. Players can also invade other FOBs, beef up their own bases\u2019 security, and do other things that I haven\u2019t had much chance to play around with because Metal Gear Solid V\u2019s PS4 servers have been failing all day. Last Monday, GameSpot sent a number of Metal Gear fans into a panic by declaring, based on a screenshot from an early copy of the game, that this entire FOB system would require real-money payments to use, but that\u2019s incorrect. You actually get your first FOB for free. When you unlock the feature, you\u2019ll be prompted to plant a base in one of three locations, all of which will cost you nothing:\nAdvertisement So, yes: You can build a FOB, expand it, develop security, and reap all the benefits without dropping any real money, despite all the misinformation that floated around last week. After the first base, though, things start getting hairy. See those \u201cMB Coins\u201d? That\u2019s MGSV\u2019s version of real money, and you\u2019ll need to spend a fair amount if you want to build more FOBs. Here\u2019s what it costs to rent out ocean space for your second base: So how do those numbers translate to real money? Konami server problems are preventing me from accessing the store to double-check this, but Metal-Gear.net grabbed a screenshot showing that these coins are expensive as hell: If these are final prices, it\u2019ll cost you around $16 just for a second FOB, which is nuts. We\u2019re not sure just how much it\u2019ll benefit players to have more than one FOB, and we can\u2019t test it out right now\u2014friggin\u2019 Konami server problems!\u2014but jeez, that\u2019s expensive. You\u2019ll also be able to earn MB Coins through daily rewards, which you\u2019ll get just for logging in\u2014kinda like a mobile game! Hmm. I see what you\u2019re doing here, Konami. Unfortunately, right now the numbers are tiny\u2014you\u2019ll only get a handful of coins as your daily bonus for the next few days: It\u2019s unclear whether you can also get MB Coins through regular play. I haven\u2019t gotten any over the ~50 hours I\u2019ve spent with the game so far, but Konami\u2019s servers have been offline. When you\u2019re playing offline, the whole system is disabled. It should be noted: you can play through the entire game without caring about any of this. That\u2019s what I did, and I think it\u2019s excellent. But of course, it\u2019s hard to get that sour, metallic, microtransactiony taste out of your mouth. Why do you have to ruin everything, Konami?
