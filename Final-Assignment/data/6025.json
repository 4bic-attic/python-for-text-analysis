Whereas, Tinubu was acquitted for non- compliance with section 3 (D), the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, is insisting on Dr. Abubakar Saraki standing trial for an issue that the former Lagos State governor was acquitted and the suit struck out.\u201d \n \nAlso to be discussed is the media war between Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State and the former governor of Bayelsa state, Timi Sylva.", "source": "Jimi Disu's Blog"}
