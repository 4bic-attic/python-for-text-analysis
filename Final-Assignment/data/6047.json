Nick Jones recently made the move to Brooklyn so hopefully we will be seeing a lot more stuff coming out of New York soon. First off here\u2019s an Instagram Slam featuring many of the city\u2019s finest young hittaz: \n \nFresh off the streets we hit up Canarsie skatepark with just enough daylight to catch a quick session and film an Instagram slam. With riders like Stephon Fung, Jake Layton,  Martin Ochoa (AKA TheShiftLife) and many more you know the session was lit. Sit back, hit play and enjoy some fine riding outta New York City. \n \nRiders: Stephon Fung, Jake Layton, Freddie Caramanico,  Tenzin Nyandak, Tyson Zhang, Martin Ochoa, Steven Ocasio, Joe Hanusiewicz, Steve Croteau, Billy Malkotsis \n \n\u201cFresh off the streets we hit up Canarsie skatepark with just enough daylight to catch a quick session and film an Instagram Slam.
