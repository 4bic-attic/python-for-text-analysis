And, yeah, there are now definite plans to record,\" Richards told a forum in New York organized by Internet radio station iHeartRadio.\n\nThe now septuagenarian rockers have toured actively in recent years, recently completing a summer swing through North America, but have not released a new album since \"A Bigger Bang\" in 2005.\n\nThat album, in turn, was the first by The Rolling Stones in eight years.\n\nThe Rolling Stones are widely regarded as one of rock's defining acts, producing classic albums such as \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main St.\" and feuding with The Beatles for the crown of Britain's top band.\n\nRichards, known for his hard-living and cantankerous public comments, on Friday releases \"Crosseyed Heart,\" his first solo album in 23 years.\n\nThe album -- featuring Richards, rather than Stones frontman Mick Jagger, on vocals -- brings in a range of collaborators including the jazz and blues singer Norah Jones.", "source": "Yahoo!
