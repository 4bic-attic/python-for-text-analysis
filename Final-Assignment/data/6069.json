Besides packing (we're moving up the street to a new place- with a yard), I'll be sweating my butt off at a new type of fitness class, trillfit.\nInspired by hip-hop and aimed at health-minded millennials, trillfit organizes compelling fitness activations and social gatherings (complete with premium gift bags) that celebrate the urban experience. Led by world-class instructors and set to the score of live DJ\u2019s spinning, trillfit fuses hip-hop and fitness into one party-like experience.\nI'm a little worried I'm going to get my butt kicked, but hey, it's worth a shot. Plus, I'll get to put my new apple watch (which Eric surprised me with yesterday, so sweet!)\u00a0to the test. I'm looking forward to testing the activity features and seeing how many calories I can burn. By the looks of this class, it seems like it's going to be a lot.\nWant to experience trillfit for yourself?\u00a0You can get tickets to the launch event here.\n*Thanks to the folks at trillfit for inviting me to this event.", "source": "The Good Girl Gone Blog"}
