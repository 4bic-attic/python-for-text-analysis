Now \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d the Croatian Interior Ministry said on its website, traffic is banned on roads leading to the seven border crossings. \n\nThings started out smoothly, with police coaxing frightened migrants across the border Wednesday. But by Thursday, chaos erupted as thousands of people broke through police barriers set up at the train station in the border town of Tovarnik. \n\nWomen were wailing and police tried to help children as masses of people pushed their way out of the holding area set up for processing. \n\nPolice did not use force against the migrants, as they tried to keep the barriers in place. They finally gave up and the migrants started running into Croatia. \n\nTerence Pike, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Croatia, told CNN that Croatian authorities had been prepared to handle only an influx of 500 migrants and refugees a day. \n\n\u201cI think that too many refugees entered in an uncontrolled way on the first day,\u201d said Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. \n\n\u201dYes, of course, Croatia showed a human face, but I stress that the safety of Croatian citizens and the stability of the state comes first,\u201d she said. \n\nCroatia can\u2019t care for and satisfy the needs of so many people, she said, calling for tougher surveillance across state borders. \n\nInterior Minister Ranko Ostojic said the capacity to take in migrants has been reached. \n\nBy nightfall, police set up a new perimeter in an attempt to stop more than 1,000 migrants from penetrating farther into Tovarnik, where bullet holes left over from the Balkan wars of the 1990s still scar some buildings. \n\nCroatia became the latest pressure point in the migrant crisis after Hungarian riot police used tear gas and water cannons Wednesday to turn back people at that country\u2019s border with Serbia. \n\nMigrants attempting to reach Western Europe were left with a difficult choice: Stay and contend with Hungary\u2019s tough new border defenses, or set out through Croatia on another uncertain path toward the European Union\u2019s wealthier nations. \n\nFrustrations boiled over after Hungary had sealed the final hole in its border with Serbia a day earlier, shutting off a popular route used by tens of thousands of people in Europe\u2019s vast migrant crisis. \n\nThe move left desperate men, women and children \u2014 most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East \u2014 blocked by a razor-wire fence from entering. \n\nBut the impasse at that entry point into the European Union won\u2019t stop the flow of migrants attempting their arduous journeys, said Eugenio Ambrosi, regional director of the International Organization for Migration. \n\n\u201cPeople will continue to try to reach Europe through Hungary, Croatia or any other route that might be available to them,\u201d he told CNN. \n\nAfter Croatia, migrants are expected to try to reach Germany by traveling up through Slovenia and then Austria. But it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll ultimately fare better on that route. \n\nSlovenia Prime Minister Miro Cerar tweeted Thursday that his country is committed to protecting the EU\u2019s external borders. \n\nThe Slovenian Interior Ministry said it hadn\u2019t discussed with Croatia the possibility of providing a safe corridor to migrants and that such a move would violate national and European laws. \n\nThe ministry said it would carry out its \u201cobligations to manage migration and control its borders\u201d and expected Croatia to do the same. \n\nCroatia is a member of the European Union, but unlike its northern neighbors, it isn\u2019t part of the Schengen Agreement that eliminated border controls between many EU nations. \n\nSome people gathered at the Serbian-Hungarian border said they were wary of taking the Croatian route if it meant they would only end up stuck at yet another closed crossing. \n\nThey say turning around and heading back to the troubled countries they fled \u2014 such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iraq \u2014 isn\u2019t an option. \n\nThe current crisis has prompted other EU nations to reintroduce security measures at borders with other member states. \n\nAustrian Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said his country had started border control measures on its southern border with Slovenia. \n\nGermany\u2019s minister for migration and refugees resigned \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d on Thursday. \n\nManfred Schmidt had been criticized for the slow process of dealing with asylum application and creating a backlog. \n\nAt the end of August, 276,617 applications still needed to be processed, according to a ministry spokesperson. \n\n\u201cDr. Schmidt has done an excellent job and the federal interior minister regrets losing him as head of this office,\u201d German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement. \n\nAid workers say Europe is facing its largest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. \n\nMore than 430,000 migrants have come to Europe by sea so far this year, double the number that arrived during all of 2014, the International Organization for Migration said. \n\nMigrants typically cross the Mediterranean and try to go through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria before finally reaching Germany or other European countries known to be welcoming to refugees. \n\nThe EU is still trying to figure out how to distribute 160,000 migrants \u2014 and whether to set quotas for member countries to absorb them. \n\n\u201cThe crisis is moving quite fast \u2014 and unfortunately is moving much faster than the response that was put in place by all the concerned governments,\u201d said Ambrosi of the IOM.", "source": "1490Wosh.com"}
