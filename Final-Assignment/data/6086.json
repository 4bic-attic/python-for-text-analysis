A Greek government spokesperson also said Tuesday that Russia would likely avoid using the Greece route, despite having an official permission to do so for the period from September 1 to September 24. \n\n\u00a0 \nRussia swiftly reacted to Bulgaria\u2019s denial of the airspace and Greece\u2019s announcement, saying it will definitely continue sending humanitarian aid to Syria using alternative routes. Iran and some central Asian states had been named as potential access routes to deliver the aid. \n\n\u00a0 \nTehran has yet to officially comment on the issue. \n\n\u00a0 \nBulgaria also issued a statement on Wednesday, saying it is ready to allow the Russian planes en route to Syria to cross the Bulgarian airspace only if Moscow permits an inspection of the cargo. The statement came following allegations by some Western governments that the state civil aviation planes may be carrying weapons and ammunition to Syria. \n\n\u00a0 \nRussia, however, has vehemently dismissed the claims, saying it is only supplying \u201chumanitarian cargo\u201d to Syria. \n \nStory Code: 485", "source": "Islam Times"}
