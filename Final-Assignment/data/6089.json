Where has the time gone?\u00a0\u00a0 Seems like only yesterday that we met our precious little Tizita getting off a plane in Appleton. She had just left the only home she had ever known in Ethiopia and was stepping into her new life as a part of our family. What a great day it was! We celebrate her Tiziversary every Sept.12 or thereabouts. We always have a special cake and give her a present or two. We also try to do a special activity. This year, for the second year, we walked in the\u00a0 Brigg's and Al Walk for Children's Hospital. The walk takes place in Milwaukee. There are so many people all walking for a great cause. It always humbles me to see all the T shirts in honor or memory of so many child champions. \u00a0It was a beautiful day for the three mile walk. After the walk, we enjoyed a lunch at the Ethiopian Village Restaurant. It was delicious as usual. John and I brought the girls home while Courtney, Paul, and Alissa stopped for a beer on the way home. We had yogurt at the new Cenex Yogurt place and then went over to St. John's to use Tizita's new volleyball which was a gift from us for the Tiziversary. We all had pizza and beers at On the Rock and then while the girls went out with Mallory, John, Soli, Tiz, and I watched TV. It was a perfectly wonderful celebration of a fantastic little lady! Here are some photos of the day: Today we all went to church and then after lunch everyone left to go home. John, mom, and I put fall decorations on the cemetery and now we wait for the Packers who play later tonight. \u00a0", "source": "Living the good life in Grandmaville"}
