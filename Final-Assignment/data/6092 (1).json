It has the latest information about who has US patents in Canada, where the US patent holders are, what they patented in the US market and the trends of their US patents.  \n\nIn 2009, when I was working for the Region of Peel government, Canada, I successfully used patent mapping to identify 20 US patent intensive companies as the potential employers for highly educated immigrants. Following this initiative, I created a Canadian patent competitive intelligence (CI) database to track the latest patent competence of over 5000 Canadian entities, in all sector throughout Canada, on a weekly basis. My work with Region of Peel from 2010 to 2012 showed that this database can provide the \"no-older-than-7-day\" intelligence for long-term strategic research/planning and short-term tactics. This is also the first attempt in Canada to use patent landscape as a regional economic strength indicator and a baseline for policy harmonization and policy performance evaluation.", "source": "Recently Uploaded Slideshows"}
