The posts are all written by me. The goal is to educate and entertain by sharing resources that can benefit artists. It takes talent and commitment to thrive as an indie artist. But it also takes balance and fitness. No one talks to artists about this truth: You have to be well enough.. physically.. mentally..emotionally...financially... to get your work done. At the same time, so many artists struggle with chronic conditions that impact their productivity. No wonder artists are stressed. Many posts on the blog here offer possible solutions.... and celebrate the traits all the best artists share: (button below from Alaska Robotics\u00a0http://alaskarobotics.com/) Scroll down this \"Your Guide\" post for \u00a0background on the blog and for these categories of highlighted posts:\nNew for 2015 \u00a0--- Yoga for Artists; Art and Anxiety - Dance Steps and Resources; Copyright Info for Artists; Cecil the Lion; Comic Con 2015; Claire Wendling in California.\nPosts of Note -- Maleficent; Martin \"Marty\" Mouse; Google Doodle Mystery Artists Revealed; Horse of Course; Posts from the Most Active Year\nOther Popular Topics; Humorous and Historical Posts\n______________________________________\nFor the origin of the SNB logo, see this post:\u00a0http://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/07/snb-logo-origin-story.html\nSNB and BTS BACKSTORY Stuart Ng Books is very small business in Torrance, CA. Our niche is books on illustration, animation and comic art. Our wonderful, loyal patrons are artists, students and collectors in these fields.\nWe started in the genteel era of old school hands-on bookselling, and we've weathered the transition to the Online arena. Our bookstore is mostly mail order. \u00a0In addition to our website, we sell books at conventions and book fairs.\nI say \"our\" because SNB started as a 2-person operation. We had a book room in the house for inventory. The dining room table was the packing station for mail orders. I was the voice on the phone, processed orders, and schlepped boxes to the post office. But it's called Stuart Ng Books for a reason. Once the books started earning their way and moved out of house and into their own office space, I'm was ready to segue into BTS (behind-the-scenes) mode.\nStuart is a man on a mission. He is always on the job: in constant search for great books and artists. He is known for discovering treasures during his annual trip to France to attend the festival in Angouleme, Europe's largest comic art convention. He doesn't speak or read French; he selects his inventory strictly for the art. He's the visual one. I'm more verbal. I took some French lessons... so now I can try to talk with people there (and order more than a ham and cheese sandwich at the cafes).\nWhen Stuart launched the business full-time in 1997, we had no idea we would become a world-wide resource for books in our field. When I married Stuart... a LONG time ago.. I had no idea I would also be marrying a small business (we didn't meet in business school.... but that's another story). We have exhibited at San Diego Comic Con for 18 years. Where we find ourselves now, all these years later, is a creative and engaging place to be.\nOur patrons seek out Stuart at conventions and online. They buy books from him because his \"eye\" and expertise are a bonus they value. Part of the fun of Stuart Ng Books is how we get to facilitate connections and inspiration. We get to see the artistic process in action. We steward the passing of cherished books from the reference libraries of artists who are masters in their field into the hands and creative spirit of a next generation. I try to remind us of all this on the days when our \"What is the Matrix\" question haunts us:\u00a0Can a little book business survive in the internet age?\u00a0Stay tuned .... The blog started in 2008 as a way to share (my) news and views on our booths at conventions ... and on exhibits and shows we attend that artists might find inspiring.\nReoccurring themes on the blog archive include\u00a0\"Get Inspired\"... \"Your Science Lesson\"... \"Your Business Lesson,\" \"Con,\" \"POV shot,\" \"Horse Show,\" \"Book Fair\"...\nSee \"FAQ,\" \"Stewardship\" and \"Legacy Books\" for posts about bringing YOU the benefits of a devoted rare bookseller in world where mom and pop bookstores are themselves becoming endangered!\nNEW FOR 2015\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0YOGA FOR ARTISTS Delighted to share stretches and restorative options for Artists and others whose work demands long hours of sitting.

The Stuart Ng Books - Claire Wendling connection dates back to 2005. That year, Claire was the featured artist at the annual \u00a0Angouleme Festival of Bande Dessinee, the largest comics festival in Europe.\nPrior to the 2005 festival, Stuart had discovered Wendling's work via her sketchbook of personal drawings \"Desk\" (first published in France; current edition published by Stuart Ng Books)....\n\u00a0http://stuartngbooks.com/wendling-desk.html\n....and her award-winning art for the Bande Dessinee (or BD) series \"Les Lumieres des Amalou\" (written by Christophe Gibelin).\nhttp://stuartngbooks.com/les-lumieres-de-lamalou-edition-integrale.html\nInspired to attend the 2005 festival for the chance to see a career retrospective of her work, and perhaps meet the artist, Stuart embarked on his first-ever trip to France. In fact, it was the first time he had ever traveled outside of the US. Stuart does not speak or read French. Fortunately for all of us, Claire and her charming husband and colleague Christian speak fluent \u00a0English.\nEven from those first meetings in the city cafes, Claire and Stuart spoke a common language of appreciation: for Claire's unique skills; and for Stuart's ability to bring her visionary talent to an ever-expanding US and worldwide community of peers and fans.\nIn the years that followed, Stuart's annual trips to Angouleme for the festival also included a visit with Claire and Christian... bringing them news and appreciation from her US fans ... and always talk of a hopeful visit by them to the US.\nIn 2015, on the 10th anniversary of the Claire Wendling-Stuart Ng connection, Claire was able to accept two long-offered invitations that Stuart had conveyed to her from mutual friends. Claire appeared as a special guest at the \u00a0Big Wow comics convention in early April. She accepted an honorary doctorate and speaking engagements at the Academy of Art Universtiy in San Francisco in April and May. Photo below shows Claire and Stuart at Claire's table at Big Wow.\nHere on the blog are a series of 6 posts with photos and behind the scenes highlights from this long-awaited return of Claire Wendling to her beloved California ... where she worked for Warner Bros Feature Animation in the 1990s.\nClaire Wendling at Big Wow Convention (background post)\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/04/claire-wendling-at-big-wow-convention.html\nClaire Wendling -- Highlights from Big Wow and speaking engagement at Academy of Art University\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/04/post-in-progress-claire-wendling.html\n\"animal\" art show at Gnomon School (Claire attended and met with several of the artists)\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/05/animal-benefit-art-exhibition-at-gnomon.html\nPaul Choy photos from Claire Wendling signing at SNB\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/05/paul-choy-photos-from-claire-wendling.html\nBehind the Scenes at Wendling signing and CA visit\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/05/behind-scenes-at-wendling-visit-to-snb.html\nClaire Wendling sketching at Big Wow, link to video by John Fleskes\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/05/claire-wendling-sketching-video-from.html\nPOSTS OF NOTE\nMALEFICENT Current favorites include the 4 posts I wrote in June 2014 for film \"Maleficent\" .. with 2 detailed posts on the QandA with director Robert Stromberg and Production Designer Dylan Cole that I attended at Gnomon school.\nHere are links for the four June posts on Maleficent --\n\u00a0http://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2014/06/making-of-maleficent-event-held-at.html\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2014/06/making-of-maleficent-talk-with-robert.html\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2014/06/he-art-of-maleficent-sleeping-beautys.html\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2014/06/many-messages-of-maleficent-updated-6814.html\nMore Maleficent posts in Sept and Oct for the \"Once Upon A Dream\" book signing including this re-cap of the event\u00a0http://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2014/10/once-upon-dream-maleficent-dream-event.html\n(LtoR, Dylan Cole, Robert Stromberg, Charles Solomon, Don Hahn at Center Stage Gallery for book signing co-hosted by Stuart Ng Books)\nMarch 3, 2015 post on \"Art of Motion Picture Costume Design\" exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising Museum. \u00a0http://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2015/03/maleficent-birdman-etc-at-fashion.html\nHere's link to LA Times story about the exhibit...\u00a0http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-fidm-exhibit-20150222-story.html\nThe featured costume for this exhibit was the Maleficent gown from the christening scene.\nMARTIN \"MARTY\" MOUSE tours the cons ... and the world!

Check their website for calendar of upcoming presentations: \u00a0http://www.printmuseum.org/ HORSE OF COURSE One of the many reasons Stuart Ng Books is located in Torrance is the proximity to HORSES!!\nNo, I don't have a horse -- but just a few miles from us is the rural enclave of \u00a0Palos Verdes (PV) \u00a0-- a thriving equestrian community -- with miles of trails -- lots of riding stables -- all located right on the coast with ideal weather. If you want to sketch horses and equestrian life in a mild, shaded climate there are a number of public parks in PV with rings that riders use to train their horses as well as the various public and private stables in the area. Here are links for two of the public parks:\nErnie Howlett Park (site for annual charity horse show)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/ernie-howlett-park-rolling-hills-estates\nDapplegray Park, Rolling Hills Estates\nhttp://www.ci.rolling-hills-estates.ca.us/index.aspx?page=116\nEvery September, a nationally ranked charity horse show, The Portuguese Bend National Horse Show, is held in PV.\nIt's a family friendly event with TONS of amenities. -- and an outstanding sketching opportunity for artists. There is a large, shaded, grassy knoll where you can sit for hours and sketch. You can also get quite close to the horses and riders if you want. While many equestrian events in PV are FREE to attend, there is a nominal admission charge for the charity horse show on Sat \u00a0& Sun -- because\u00a0all\u00a0proceeds for this event are a fundraiser. Admission to the charity show is free on Fridays. The show runs fri - sun on the 1st weekend in Sept.\n\"HORSE SHOW 2011 - PREVIEWS AND PICS FROM PREVIOUS SHOWS\" post from 9-6-11 has some of my favorite action shots of horses and gives you a flavor of this very special event.\nhttp://stuartngbooks.blogspot.com/2011/09/1-day-until-horse-show-sept-9-11.html\nThe show has been held for almost 60 years by the non-profit PCCH (Peninsula Committee Children's Hospital), an organization that raises money for Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
