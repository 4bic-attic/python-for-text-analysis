Sorry about that. Let's try this again.\u00a0\nHere are pics of Zack's first day of 2nd grade, along\u00a0with his teacher, Ms. Cipollina. He was very excited because he's in a portable classroom (apparently a very desirable commodity among the 2nd grade set). He loves his teacher (and having chatted\u00a0with her for a while today, I can see why) and so far loves 2nd grade.\u00a0\nHe's really been doing great and I can already see a big change in him. He has increased confidence. For example, Rob and I always drop him off on\u00a0the first day so that we can figure out who his teacher is. He wanted us to walk up to the 2nd grade line (they line up outside before going to their rooms) with him, then all of a sudden he was gone. He was off saying hello to some of his other friends. The times I've dropped him off at KAH in the morning, I've barely signed him in before he's off\u00a0finding friends to\u00a0play with, and forget getting a hug from him in the morning! That\u00a0said, when I pick him up, I get a really big hug and smile. \u00a0\nHe's been doing all his homework\u00a0while at KAH; they have some homework time before the fun starts and he's been taking advantage of it. He's been much more\u00a0responsible about the tasks he has to do before and after school, remembering to get his lunch, take care of his backpack, feed the dog, etc., without being prompted.\u00a0\nHis\u00a0philosophy seems to be that there's no good\u00a0reason why he can't be friends with\u00a0everyone. He talks\u00a0about\u00a0a lot of\u00a0different kids that he plays with at school. He's got a lot of friends in\u00a0the neighborhood, too, including Coby who is on the same block. On\u00a0the weekends they've been moving back and forth between their two houses, playing this, that, and the other thing for hours. They get a long so very well---it makes all of us\u00a0parents very happy!\u00a0\nHe's also developing more confidence in new social\u00a0situations. Last night he tried out taekwando at the Y. It was the first\u00a0class and he'd never met the instructor. A year ago he would have made a big fuss about me staying\u00a0with him in the room, but last night, while he was a\u00a0bit shy at first, he was perfectly fine when I said I'd be back to get him when it was over. You could also tell he was positively beaming when the instructor told him that he was impressed\u00a0with how quick Zack was.\u00a0\nWhich leads to my final story. When he got home last night, it was late, so I told him that he had to be quick in\u00a0the shower (not typically his forte). He took a shockingly quick shower, but one that\u00a0seemingly\u00a0involved\u00a0soap and shampoo. I expressed my shock, to which he immediately replied \"See? I'm\u00a0quick at a lot of things.\"\u00a0", "source": "Abi's New Home"}
