Five talking points as Liverpool draw with Norwich", "id": "b03f101a-ff04-4a73-9c8a-c3538ee978c0", "content": "COMMENT By Tom Maston \n\nLiverpool laboured to a 1-1 draw with Norwich City at Anfield on Sunday as Brendan Rodgers continues to come under pressure from sections of the club's support Daniel Sturridge returned from his injury woes but it took until the second half when Christian Benteke went off injured until he looked anything like his old self\n\nAnd with Simon Mignolet struggling at the other end there is plenty for Rodgers to ponder\n\nHAS RODGERS DESTROYED THE ANFIELD FORTRESS In years gone by any side coming to Anfield would be forgiven for feeling a little overawed at the thought of playing in front of the Kop but against this current Liverpool side very few teams turn up expecting defeat\n\nTheir laboured attacking play and defensive frailty means there is always an opportunity for a shock result and without homegrown players Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher to really take games by the scruff of the neck and become engrossed in the atmosphere there is a feeling many of the current squad are themselves unable to raise their game when they pass through the Shankly Gates\n\nThough the Anfield faithful are yet to really turn on Brendan Rodgers \u2013 there were only a smattering of boos at the final whistle \u2013 the pressure will only continue to mount if he cannot lift his side from their current malaise\n\nAn unremarkable 1-0 win over Bournemouth was followed by a thumping defeat to West Ham and a draw against Norwich did little to dispel the feeling that there is a fear of playing at home\n\nIn the next 10 days Carlise United Aston Villa and FC Sion all visit Merseyside and Rodgers is well aware of the task that awaits him in lifting his side\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got four games here to get our performance to where we want to be It\u2019s a special place to play but you\u2019ve got to have courage to play here\n\n\u201cYou have to embrace it and you have to play positive football When I first came here it was a fortress but now we\u2019re having to build that again\u201d\n\nThe fact that it is taking him over 18 months since Luis Suarez left to instil a winning mentality into his side when they play at home is alarming and adds even more fuel to the reports he is losing the dressing room\n\nManagers with the biggest personalities are able to lift their players to play at home but that seems beyond Rodgers at times His whistling on the touchline is all he seems to be able to muster and you feel his team need more passion from their manager if they are to become a force at Anfield once again\n\nKeeping home fans on side with positive performances is one of the most important factors for any manager nevermind those that are most under pressure and Rodgers needs results at Anfield sooner rather than later\n\nINGS AND STURRIDGE STRIKE UP UNDERSTANDING Daniel Sturridge\u2019s return from injury meant Liverpool fans were able to see the England international partnered with Christian Benteke for the first time since the Belgian\u2019s arrival on Merseyside and on paper it is a twosome which should yield goals\n\nBut for 45 frustrating first-half minutes neither player was able to stamp their authority on the game with Benteke limited to hold-up play with his back to goal while Sturridge looked unsurprisingly rusty \u2013 most notably when denied by John Ruddy just before half-time\n\nIt was only when Danny Ings replaced Benteke at the break did Liverpool and Sturridge come alive as the summer signing from Burnley\u2019s ability to run in behind allowed the hosts to play more on the counter-attack rather than the patient passing play that has borne little fruit so far this season\n\nSturridge\u2019s finest season to date came in 2013-14 when he played alongside Luis Suarez and though Ings is nowhere near the same level as the Uruguayan his mobility and willingness to chase every ball in the final third means he does share some fleeting characteristics with the Barcelona man\n\nObviously with Liverpool having spent \u00a3325 million on Benteke he is likely to be given every opportunity to impress but if Brendan Rodgers wants to get the best out of Sturridge he may be better off giving Ings a run in the side and allow them to build a formidable partnership\n\nMORENO PROVIDES A MUCH-NEEDED OUTLET Liverpool\u2019s eagerness to go through Philippe Coutinho with the majority of their attacks is understandable given his undoubted talents in the final third but it does mean they can be slightly narrow when going forward\n\nAnd so it was refreshing to see Alberto Moreno begin to come of age and offer some much needed width to the Reds as he put in a man of the match showing down the left-hand side\n\nDefensive mistakes underpinned his first season on Merseyside and the 23-year-old found himself on the sidelines in the opening weeks of the season as Joe Gomez impressed at left-back\n\nBut with Rodgers switching to a 3-4-1-2 formation so as to fit in both Sturridge and Benteke Moreno was deployed in midfield and left to attack at will with Steven Whittaker isolated and unable to halt the Spaniard\u2019s runs\n\nThe former Sevilla man delivered a number of testing balls into the box during the first half before playing a superb chipped pass into Ings\u2019 path for the forward to open the scoring early in the second period and it was no coincidence that Liverpool\u2019s attacking play lacked the same fluency when he was moved back into defence late on\n\nWhether he can replicate this performance on a regular basis will determine how many opportunities he is given as the season goes on but the signs are there that Moreno can play a big part if he is allowed to forgo his defensive responsibilities\n\nMR CONSISTENCY HAS AN OFF-NIGHT Where last season it was Daniel Sturridge this campaign is shaping up to be a particularly frustrating one for Jordan Henderson when it comes to injuries\n\nHaving missed three matches with a heel injury the Liverpool skipper returned to training this week only to suffer a broken foot that will rule him out for at least six weeks\n\nIn his absence James Milner continues to lead the side on the field and was utilised in the centre against Norwich alongside Lucas Leiva in a role Henderson would likely have taken were he fit\n\nMilner has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to play in the middle of the park rather than on the flanks but his performance against the Canaries suggested playing such an important position and captaining the side may be putting a little too much responsibility on his shoulders in just his sixth appearance\n\nThe former Manchester City man was booked in just the second minute and he could have been shown a second yellow card for diving just moments later when he went down under a challenge from Robbie Brady inside the penalty area\n\nAnd though he survived to see out the 90 minutes it was the only good news he got all day as he continually misplaced passes scuffed shots and sent set-pieces into the waiting hands of John Ruddy\n\nFor a man who very rarely puts in poor performances it was uncharacteristic in the extreme and the type of display that Rodgers will hope is a one-off\n\nRODGERS RINGS THE CHANGES Since coming back into the side in December 2014 Simon Mignolet has been unrecognisable from the timid goalkeeper who was dropped at Old Trafford for Brad Jones last season\n\nHe came very close to claiming the Golden Glove for clean sheets last term and did not concede in any of his opening three outings this time around\n\nBut in flapping at a corner and failing to get it clear of danger he allowed Russell Martin to steal a point for Norwich and halt the momentum the Reds were building following Ings\u2019 opener\n\nAt roughly the same time David de Gea was making two superb saves to preserve the three points for Manchester United at Southampton while at the other end at Anfield John Ruddy made a string of fine saves and commanded his area superbly\n\nAnd while Mignolet has improved he continues to lack the presence and respect of others that a team like Liverpool should be getting from their goalkeeper\n\nFew believe Adam Bogdan would be a suitable replacement should Mignolet be again left out and though Rodgers claimed he would be willing to drop the former Sunderland man he was not about to blame him on this occasion\n\n\u201cWe had six men in the box who knew their roles but we lost concentration There were other factors on the goal but every keeper you bring in is there to challenge\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it before and made changes but the goal had other factors in it rather than him\"\n\nIn Rodgers\u2019 position he may have to make tough calls if he is to bring about a turnaround in results and while it would be harsh to drop Mignolet on the back of just one error he must recognise that his goalkeeper is far from the finished article he needs as his No1", "source": "Uncova"}
