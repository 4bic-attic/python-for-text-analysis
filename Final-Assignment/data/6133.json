So this is really a measure of how people rate their own virtue more than a religious conviction.\u2019\u2019 \n \nRev Colin Sinclair, minister at the Church of Scotland\u2019s Palmerston Place Church in Edinburgh, and convener of the church\u2019s mission and discipleship council said: \u201cDeath has been called \u201cthe last taboo,\u201d so a survey on attitudes to death can make for uncomfortable reading. \n \n\u201cIn this survey the small differences between the attitude of those living in Scotland and the rest of the UK could reflect the down-to-earth nature of Scots character, the impact of cultural Calvinism and a refusal to run away from the reality of life.\u201d \n \nOf the groups surveyed, Londoners seemed to have the highest estimation of their moral worth \u2013 with 52% believing they would go to heaven. \n \nAnd 40% of Brits said that if they died today they would die happy. \n \n27% of Scots also said that they would live forever if they could chose to \u2013 whilst 50% said they would turn down the offer, with the remaining 24% on the fence.", "source": "Deadline News"}
