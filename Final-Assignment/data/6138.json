(http://www.marketintelligencecenter.com/symbol/IPG\"IPG) that should provide a 5.85% return in just 205 days. Sell one Apr. '16 call at the $19.00 level for each 100 shares of Interpublic Group for a net debit per share of $17.95. That net debit also serves as the break-even point for this trade, giving it 8.88% downside protection. For a riskier play with a higher potential rate of return, consider buying the Jan. '17 call at the $15.00 at about $5.25 instead of taking a long position in the stock. This lowers your net debit to $3.50, but the stock has to close above $18.50 at expiration to keep this trade from losing money. Standard & PooraEUR(TM)s gives the stock a $23.00 12-month target price and a 3 STARS (out of 5) hold ranking. Technical indicators for the stock are bearish and support has been about $19.45 with resistance around the $20.03 level.\n\nIPG closed Tuesday at $19.70 after trading between $19.62 and $19.91. In the past year, the stock has hit a 52-week low of $16.37 and 52-week high of $22.69.", "source": "Individual.com"}
