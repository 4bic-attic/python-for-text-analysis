The car, a 1965 365C 1600 Cabriolet could fetch more than \u00a3250,000 when it goes under the hammer at RM Sotheby\u2019s Driven by Disruption sale before Christmas. \n \nOriginally finished in Pearl White, a friend of Joplin\u2019s painted the car\u2019s kaleidoscopic mural. Artist Dave Richards said his work represented the history of the universe. Joplin was frequently seen driving it around San Francisco during the late 1960s and remained in her family\u2019s ownership after Joplin\u2019s death in 1970. \n \nThe car was restored in the early 1990s before going on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland from 1995 until 2015. \n \n\u2018Besides Janis's music and legacy, her Porsche is the most visual and important piece of memorabilia that exists,\u2019 said Michael Joplin. \u2018She drove it everywhere - and with everyone that was anyone in the San Francisco music scene - with the top down and her feathers flying. Her music, life and car are a part of rock and roll history.\u2019 \n \n\n \nPHOTO CREDIT: Historic image of Janis Joplin and her psychedelic Porsche \u00a9 Jim Marshall Photography LLC. \n    Share this story   \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0  Tweet", "source": "Classics Honest John"}
