This fiscally responsible compromise also includes crucial safeguards to ensure that we can support these priorities for our people, businesses, and economy not only in the next budget, but also for years to come.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that because of Kelly Ayotte\u2019s political meddling it took so long for Republicans in the legislature to finally come to the table and negotiate in good faith, and New Hampshire Democrats applaud the Governor\u2019s tireless efforts to get a fiscally responsible deal done.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\r###", "source": "Press Releases"}
