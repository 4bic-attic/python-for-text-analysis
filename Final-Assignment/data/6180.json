All the fundamental issues of winter package bilateral agreements with Ukraine are settled, Chief Executive Officer of Russia\u2019s gas holding Gazprom Alexey\u00a0Miller said on Wednesday in an interview with NTV TV Channel. \n \n\"All the strategic bilateral issues are agreed with Ukraine. We expect the agreement with participation of the European Commission will be signed next week and pre-paid supplies of Russian gas will resume from October 1,\" Gazprom CEO said. \n \nNaftogaz of Ukraine will approach Gazprom in the coming several days with a request for discount in terms of the customs duty, Miller said. \"Just as in previous periods, Gazprom will forward proposals to the Russian Government,\" he added. \n \n\"The price level will be comparable and competitive with the European Union\u2019s neighbors of Ukraine. Gazprom will refrain from the Take or Pay clause for the next two quarters,\" Miller said. \n \n\"European institutions provided financing to Ukraine in the amount of $500 mln to date. This will support the purchase of about 2 bln cubic meters of gas from Gazprom, which is certainly not enough to pass the whole winter period without risks. We will continue working,\" Gazprom CEO said. \n   \n{{item.group_date}} \n  \n \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435", "source": "Itar Tass"}
