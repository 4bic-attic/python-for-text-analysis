To be fair to them, they probably played better than us on the day. We kept in the game and in extra time, it was a bit even because, when you get to that stage, it is a bit of a knife-edge. \n \n\u201cWe managed to get the winner and we are ecstatic. But we know we have to play better than that but in a cup game, you score more goals and you are through. So hopefully we will improve in a couple of weeks time (against Greenwich).\u201d \n   Promoted stories   \nIt was a great build-up for Mace\u2019s winner, which came a few minutes from the end, as Slimbridge built on their advantage of having an extra player when Egham striker Jon Hippolyte was sent off near the end for a terrible tackle on Slimbridge\u2019s Sam Turl. \n \nSterling said: \u201cWe did not play well until extra time and luckily for us, we were still in the game so we managed to get it right in the thirty minutes and get the goal. \n \n\u201cThey probably ran out of steam with ten men and luck went our way today. You make your own luck but I think we were lucky.\u201d \n \nAnd he admitted that having 11 men on the pitch against ten was always going to help when the business end of the match came along. \n \n\u201cThe extra man is always going to tell. They got tired and did not have the subs. We put our subs on (in the second half) and that freshness gives you a little bit of edge. I thought the three subs who came on for us gave us energy to the team and that pushed us over the line.\u201d \n \nNow it is another quick turnaround to the Didcot Town league clash on Saturday, and Sterling admitted they were exhausted from two tough cup ties and 210 minutes of intense football. \n \n\u201cThey went into the changing room and I said congratulations but they know my feelings on where they can improve on. We have played well this season and not picked up points so sometimes, when you don\u2019t play well, you just take the win. \n \n\u201cThey will be chuffed they have gone through, it is money for the club and they have another game in the FA Cup.\u201d \n   \n Share article  \n   \nAnd he said going to Dartford, on the other side of London, for the next round was \u2018not ideal\u2019. \u201cThey (the FA) split it from Devon to the top of London but we are just pleased we are through and we will cross that bridge after Saturday.\u201d", "source": "South Wales Argus"}
