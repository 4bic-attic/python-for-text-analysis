Presenting freshly-baked songs and the heady aroma of topical irreverence, Sunday nights (and Monday mornings) will never feel quite the same again! \n\nNever afraid to push the jokes, Kit and McConnel poke fun at everyday events and modern cultural happenings, whilst also including some serious numbers in their act.

After a wealth of experience these two men certainly know how to make an audience crease up with laughter and are a truly enjoyable pair to watch. \n\nKit and James are old friends and collaborators. In 2011 they teamed up to become Kit and McConnel and went on to sell out shows all over the UK. \n\nEvent Category: Arts | Performing Arts | Music. \n\nSubmit Once, Submit Everywhere event marketing by @evvnt - http://bit.ly/septSUBMIT", "source": "What's Happening - London"}
