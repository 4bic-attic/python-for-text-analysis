Gen. David Jones, Commander, B.D.F. \n \nBrig. Gen. David Jones \n \n\u201cWell no engineer has gone on the island to look at it to say well it\u2019s not an area to have a construction.\u00a0 But the island, of course, is mainly swamp, it\u2019s mainly swamp.\u00a0 It\u2019s not some place that you would want to go and do construction, taking into consideration the fact that it\u2019s a journey to get materials to go and fill that area.\u00a0 It would take a long time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve identified two places on the mainland that we believe is more practical to have a base constructed.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s up to the engineer who goes into the area and it\u2019s an open plea from me and I believe from our ministry, whichever engineer feels that they could get the job done we will welcome them to go along with us.\u00a0 We will take them to the area and if they provide the estimate as to how much it will cost to construct the base, as soon as it is done the BDF will be there working.\u201d \n \nNext Tuesday, the BTV is expected to return to the area, but it is not certain whether the B.D.F. will be substituting on that day.\u00a0", "source": "Channel 5 Belize"}
