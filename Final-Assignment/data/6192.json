Not with him.\nGood girl schoolteacher Gemma has always played it safe, colored inside the lines. Her only indulgence is a recurrent fantasy about Carson, her town\u2019s ultimate bad boy. Carson is fifty shades of wrong for Gemma, but damn if the risk-taking ex-con doesn\u2019t inspire dark, waking-at-night-clenching-the-sheets thoughts in Gemma\u2019s orderly little mind...\nDon\u2019t touch. Don\u2019t look. Don\u2019t even think about him. No matter how good he might be in your dreams, he\u2019s bad.\nAll Gemma\u2019s promises fly out the window when her best friend goes missing. Carson is the only one who can help Gemma uncover the truth, and if some sparks fly along the way\u2026 so what? It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\nRight?\nAs tensions rise, Carson and Gemma are both stripped down, revealing steamy paranormal secrets and an unbridled hunger that simply refuses to be tamed. Available Free on Amazon September 14- 18 New author making her way in the urban fantasy genre. A story about a school teacher looking to make a new life for herself in a new town meets an ex-con (although I don't think she knows) trying to make up for past mistakes.\nGemma, the pink slipped teacher from Tampa, moves to a small community hoping to start a new life. A flat tire introduces her to Carson, a hunky guy who just happened to have done some jail time but is trying to make up for that by being a good samaritan. An instant attraction is all that they remember from this encounter until they meet again later when both are trying to locate a new friend of Gemma's who has disappeared. This new friend just happens to be Carson's sister. That instant attraction again rears it's head and as time goes on they discover they are soul \"mates\". Once this discovery is made their powers are \"awakened\" and they are caught up in a plot by some evil character using \"unmated\" humans to do his bidding. (not real sure what this bidding is though).\nThe first half of the book had me scratching my head as to why this was classified as an urban fantasy. I thought it was going to be a straight romance story but then enter the \"powers\" of soul shifting by Carson and healing by Gemma and the author's intent became a little clearer.\nIt has all the ingredients of a good story even though I thought it was compacted and a little choppy in the telling. There is romance, danger, magic, loyalty and a dangling ending that entices you to pick up her next book in what I assume will be a series. At least I hope so since the main problem of the story was still yet to be solved. Some seasoned readers may feel this read needs a little more fluidity in the writing but when you finish the book you have a clear picture of the story and characters. I am sure this author will grow in her talent as it looks like she has a good grasp of the necessary components to make a good story.\nI would say give this book a read to have some background for future installments.\nI give this book 3 \"developing\" sheep. Jeanie G\nExcerpt\nThe waste of his time pissed Carson Sanchez off more than anything else. Was it annoying that his name always popped up when there was a burglary near-by? Of course. Did it irritate him that after a decade of maintaining a squeaky-clean record people still thought the worst of him? No doubt. But to drag him half-way across the county when he could have given his alibi over the phone really pissed him off.\nWhen he\u2019d first gotten out of prison, it was a nearly weekly occurrence. Small town cops didn\u2019t have much better to do than harass their resident felons. As time went on, they bothered him less, but every now and then someone in town or someone in law enforcement liked to remind him that his past misdeeds weren\u2019t forgotten and that he would never be truly free. Regardless of whether he served his time or not.\nThe rain beat down on his cherry red Camaro, but it didn\u2019t bother him \u2013 the car needed a good wash anyway. He\u2019d had a hell of a day \u2013 the Lake County Sheriffs weren\u2019t exactly known for their hospitality to ex-cons. They had no reason whatsoever to think he was connected to the string of robberies half an hour away. Lack of evidence didn\u2019t stop them from holding him as a \u2018person of interest\u2019 for nearly ten hours. His shoulders ached from being tensed for so long and he wanted nothing more than a boiling hot shower and a cold beer before turning in for the night.\nFlashing lights up ahead made him tap on the brakes \u2013 figures, there were always accidents in this kind of weather. He slowed to a crawl, peering through the thick sheet of rain to analyze the extent of the damage. There was only one car on the side of the road and he soon saw that it wasn\u2019t an accident at all. He could make out movement in the car, but not much else was visible through the weather.\nHe debated stopping \u2013 he should just mind his own business, take his happy ass home and leave the rescuing to someone else. He should. Then he thought of what his best friend would say.\nYou made a promise to the Universe, remember, Aaron\u2019s voice chimed in his head.\nIt was hardly fair to hold that over his head; he was sitting in front of the parole board, he would have promised anything to anyone if he thought it would get him out of jail. For years he lived without caring for anyone. Without caring how his actions affected others. He\u2019d hurt so many innocent people and taken so much away that by the time he got out, he was ready to settle the score. He had a lifetime worth of bad karma added up and he couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to tip the scale toward the good side.\nHis stomach grumbled, reminding him that the police hadn\u2019t fed him and the two double cheeseburgers he scarfed down on the interstate were long gone.\nHe clenched his teeth and cursed silently. He couldn\u2019t just drive past.\nCarson parked the Camaro in front of the incapacitated car and turned his flashers on. He steeled himself for the hot shower he was about to get.\n\u201cSo not what I had in mind,\u201d he grumbled as he opened the door and hurried to the stranger\u2019s window.\n***\n\u201cRoadside assistance, are you safe?\u201d A young friendly voice crackled through Gemma\u2019s cell phone.\n\u201cYes, I am. I just have a flat,\u201d she answered, feeling silly for needing help.\n\u201cOkay, may I have the name and number found on the front of your membership card?\u201d\nGemma gave the woman the information she requested and waited as deft fingers tapped her details into the computer.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Fellings, it looks like your membership has expired,\u201d the woman sounded genuinely apologetic.\nA lump rose in Gemma\u2019s throat as she forced back tears. She saw headlights in her mirror but didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s not possible. It says right here on my card; it expires May of this year,\u201d she insisted. With a car nearly as old as she was, Roadside Assistance was a necessity; she\u2019d never gone without it.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, and it\u2019s June 6th,\u201d the representative answered politely.\nOf course it was. How had that completely slipped her notice? She\u2019d gotten so wrapped up in moving that she didn\u2019t even notice a little thing like her membership expiring.\n\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d she answered, hitting the end button on the call before the other woman could respond. What was she going to do now?\n\u201cThink, Gemma, you\u2019re resourceful.\u201d Her phone beeped letting her know the battery was going to die soon, \u201cOf course you\u2019re going to die now.\u201d\nThere was a car charger somewhere in her vehicle \u2013 she remembered seeing it earlier that morning \u2013 but the car\u2019s dim overhead light didn\u2019t do much to help her locate it. While the boxes in her back seat were meticulously organized, the stray belongings in the front seat were anything but. The floorboard was covered with trash, receipts, sweaters and various other things that Gemma thought she might need some day while on the road. A charger was definitely among those things, she just had to find it. She crawled over the passenger seat, rooting around in the floorboard for the elusive white cable when a loud knock on her window startled her.\n***\nHe cursed himself with every hurried step he took through the pelting rain. Droplets hit his exposed skin like stinging nettles and Carson had no sooner gotten out of his car than he wished he could just climb back in. But there was someone in distress and he had an obligation to be the Good Samaritan, no matter how much it sometimes irked him.\nHe cupped his hands around his face and pressed his nose to the foggy driver side window.\nAt first he didn\u2019t know what he was seeing, but the primal recesses of his brain pieced it together quickly and he felt his blood suddenly heat. She was bent over the front seat, her ass jutting into the air, tight jeans hugging the ample curve of her hips. The way she wiggled as she searched for whatever it was made his pulse quicken. She had the kind of ass a man could get into a lot of trouble over.\nA gust of wind swept down the highway and sent a chill through Carson, reminding him that he was standing like an idiot in the rain, ogling a stranger. He wasn\u2019t fresh out \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t be losing all the moisture in his mouth at the sight of a nice body. He took a step back and rapped his knuckles against the window.\nShe jumped. Her head struck the underside of the glove compartment and Carson winced for her as she rubbed the fresh knot. She crawled back to the window on her hands and knees and Carson couldn\u2019t stop himself from imprinting the image to his memory banks. The window retracted and he got his first good look at her as the wind blew rain into her face.\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d she tried to shield herself from the onslaught. Carson side-stepped to block the wind for her. \u201cIt\u2019s just a flat, but my jack is rusted,\u201d she answered.\nHe could tell that she was at her breaking point. Her car was stuffed to the brim \u2013 was she running from something\u2026 or someone? The thought of someone threatening this women brought out a protective instinct in Carson he\u2019d forgotten he had. The shadows in the car gave her a soft look and the frustration in her eyes made something deep down inside him come to life. He wanted to take her frustration away. Needed to.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a jack,\u201d he said.\nThe instant relief that crossed her face made him swell with male pride. The smile that tugged at her lips tugged at his heartstrings in turn. Never before had he felt this instant urge to right every wrong. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been with anyone. Maybe it was just desperation getting the best of him.\nThen she batted those long lashes of hers and he knew he was lost.\n\u201cThat is the best news I\u2019ve heard all day,\u201d she said.\nMaybe being the Good Samaritan wasn\u2019t so bad after all.\n***\nThe man worked quickly in the pouring rain to jack up her car. Gemma stood on the side of the road under her floral umbrella, feeling completely useless.\n\u201cYou have a spare?\u201d he asked after getting the car jacked.\n\u201cA donut. I don\u2019t have much further to go,\u201d she said, opening the trunk.\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d she muttered looking at the boxes that stood between her and the spare tire under her trunk.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, nudging her out of the way. His white t-shirt clung wetly to him and did nothing to hide the outlines of strong muscles beneath the translucent fabric. Suddenly her mouth was a desert. She licked her lips absently, trying not to picture taut flesh rippling over his muscles as he flexed and rearranged her belongings. What was wrong with her? She\u2019d never in her life been instantly attracted to someone like this. Maybe it was just the whole \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 thing that got her excited.\nHer hands flew to cover her cheeks; they were burning hot! He lifted the spare out of the trunk without any of her things getting damaged by the rain.\nIn the ten or so minutes it took for the man to change her tire, the rain stopped completely and the sun was already out forcing them both to sweat despite their damp clothes.\nHe dragged the back of his hand across his forehead before dusting his hands off.\n\u201cWell, I think that just about does it,\u201d he said. The deep timbre of his voice sent shivers down her spine.\nShe really needed to get a grip. He was just a stranger doing a nice thing \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the opening to some cheesy chick flick or something.\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d she gushed, almost giving in to the urge to give him a big hug. She eyed his soaked clothes and thought better of it\u2026 for so many reasons.\n\u201cNo problem, by the way I\u2019m\u2013\u201d he was interrupted by her phone ringing.\nShe made a face at her pocket before yanking the phone out to glare at the caller ID, as if the person on the other end knew what they were doing and they should feel very bad about it.\n\u201cMy landlord,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m late to move in, he\u2019s probably wondering where I am.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well, you\u2019re good to go now,\u201d he said, taking his jack back to his car.\n\u201cThank you again so much. You totally saved my life,\u201d she said again, getting back into the beat-up Escort.\nAs she answered her phone and pulled away, she missed the look of disappointment on the stranger\u2019s face and it wasn\u2019t until much later that she realized she never even got his name.
