A Vagrant webcomic writer\u2019s second book, Step Aside Pops, comes out this month. She talks to the Guardian about feminism and the Canadian oil sands Kate Beaton\u2019s cartoon Hark! A Vagrant remains a reliably witty presence online, and perhaps the only work in comics history where Nancy Drew, The Great Gatsby and the War of 1812 can all be found within a few clicks of each other. Hark! is also one of the few webcomics, along with Chris Onstad\u2019s Achewood, to generate enough material for multiple books \u2013 the second being Beaton\u2019s Step Aside, Pops, due out 22 September. And while Beaton is as quick in conversation as a reader might expect, she\u2019s also broadly knowledgeable about feminism, history and the forgotten experiences of Canadians working in the country\u2019s oil sands. There are a lot of jokes in Hark! A Vagrant that come from small, ironic incidents from Canadian or American history. Do you ever decide not to include something because it\u2019s too obscure?\n\nYes, I do. But the magic of the internet is that people can find out.\n\nSpeaking of the magic of the internet, can you tell me where the Straw Feminists (a pair of hairy-legged, bra-burning misandrists) came from?\n\nThey came from having a lot of conversations about feminism online. Usually when you talk about feminism, this image shows up, whether you like it or not, of the kind of militant, horrible, awful characters. And it\u2019s one of those things where, even if you want to ignore it, you can\u2019t, because people will say, \u201cWell, those people exist. Those man-hating, dick-chopping feminists exist, and in fact, one ruined my life.\u201d And you\u2019re like, oh, OK, well, I have to address this. It\u2019s always, always trotted out, but I\u2019ve never, never met anybody like that and I doubt you have.\n\nI have not.\n\nAnd you have to deal with it in conversation sometimes, and be like, \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure somebody ruined your life, and she was exactly like this, and it went down exactly that way, and I\u2019m sorry it hurt.\u201d It\u2019s kind of a bogeyman in a different way [too], because not only have I never met any of them but it\u2019s an image that legitimately scares young people away from the idea of feminism. Young girls will be like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a feminist. They burn their bras!\u201d No one has ever burned their bra. Nobody. So it\u2019s kind of a menace, but it\u2019s also a really, really funny image, as a cartoonist, to work with, because they are just heartless, awful people, which I love to draw.\n\nIt seems so galling to have to let somebody hijack that sort of conversation.\n\nYeah, but you have to! You can\u2019t be like, \u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d Then they\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo. My ex-wife.\u201d And you\u2019ll have to be like, \u201cOK, well, I\u2019m sorry about that. Must have been hard.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare that people talk about how great their ex-wives were, I find.\n\nOr ex-husbands. Yeah.\n\nWe mentioned your historical jokes but you have all kinds of material in here \u2013 the Arthurian Legends, among others. Do you read a lot of medieval literature for fun?\n\nI do. I was working on a television thing that never actually panned out, and I was up to my eyeballs in medieval stuff. But I love medieval stuff, so that\u2019s totally fine. I took a degree in history but I didn\u2019t specialize in it. I remember going in to see my adviser [in college] and she was like, \u201cOK, so you have done all this random shit. What are you going to do afterwards?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d \n\nThe answer was, \u201cI was going to get an MA in labor history\u201d, but I didn\u2019t end up doing that.\n\nLabor history?\n\nWell, I worked for a couple of years in the oil sands and you\u2019re kind of on the ground floor of industrial Canada. As a historian I really wanted to do something that mattered, I suppose. The data could be applicable to people\u2019s lives in useful ways right now. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy the medium of history, but you can study the Magna Carta again. Somebody\u2019s already done it; it\u2019s probably not going to change anybody\u2019s life right now.\n\nHow did you get to the oil sands?\n\nI\u2019m from the Maritimes, and that\u2019s where everybody goes. The east coast of Canada is always in dire economic straits, and a lot of industries that relied on coal and steel and fishing collapsed, so you have an enormous outpouring of labor into the oil sector in Alberta, especially from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. It\u2019s very common to know a lot of people who are out there, so when I graduated from university and I had this giant debt and I wanted to pay it off, it didn\u2019t take too much decision-making to say, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just do that too, and it will probably work out.\u201d It was probably one of the more important experiences of my life.\n\nWhat made it so formative?\n\nI had just finished school, so you have your kind of academic-head-in-the-clouds thing that you do when you\u2019re writing a paper, and you\u2019re like: \u201cThis is important!\u201d And then you get to the oil sands and people are dying, and the earth is being destroyed and you\u2019re like: \u201cOh, this is important.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a really big black hole of information. When you\u2019re there, you\u2019re so engulfed by this industry, and then you leave and nobody knows anything about it except for the fact that a lot of oil comes from there and it\u2019s destroying the environment and there\u2019s a lot of money. But you never have a sense of people\u2019s day-to-day lives or what they\u2019ve given up to be there or who has the choice to be there and who doesn\u2019t, and what it does to people\u2019s health, their families\u2019 lives, their marriages. \n\nThey never saw the drugs, they never saw the immigration and all of the trouble that it brought, and the displacement, and the shadow population and the whole thing - they just know that there\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s not that oil companies are just up there scooping up oil and getting handed barrels of cash; there\u2019s a lot of people\u2019s lives wrapped up in this. And now I\u2019m in this privileged line of work where I don\u2019t have to do that if I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t have to work there.\n\nWhat specifically did you do?\n\nI worked in a tool crib, which is like a warehouse. We managed all the small tools and equipment. That meant anything under $2,500 that the different tradesmen used, we would supply \u2013 so anything from nails to generators. And you had different guys \u2013 electricians and welders and pipefitters and ironworkers and all of this and that \u2013 that you had to outfit to make the whole thing run.\n\nHow long did you do that?\n\nTwo years.\n\nHow did you get out?\n\nI saved money. I paid my student loans off, I saved $10,000 and I moved to Toronto, and I thought: \u201cIf I fail at cartooning, I have a cushion and I can do something else.\u201d Because the comics were already online by then. But instead I moved to Toronto in September 2008 and I\u2019ve been making a living at this ever since.\n\nYou were able very quickly to transition to cartooning full-time, which is not something I\u2019ve heard many people say.\n\nNo, it\u2019s very uncommon. And there\u2019s a lot of reasons why it worked out for me and some of them have to do with timing: 2007 and 2008 was a really good time to get online with your work, and to have it seen and read and gather an audience. We weren\u2019t inundated in the same way with BuzzFeed and with Facebook and everything like that. The internet was smaller, in a way. \n\nYou\u2019re in a very rare position with Hark! online and in print. Do you want to keep on publishing the same way you are now?\n\nIt\u2019s always changing. I always feel like it\u2019s changing so much. I\u2019m not always going to be ahead of the curve; in some ways the webcomic game is a bit of a young person\u2019s game. Like, I don\u2019t know if when I\u2019m middle-aged with a family if I\u2019ll be putting out online content that\u2019s going to support me. The uncertainty of it has always made me a little bit uncomfortable, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. I came of age in a time when everything was completely uncertain, and I\u2019m happy to be part of a new generation that\u2019s turning things over, but we were turning things over while print floundered and wondered what to do with itself. And it had been the stalwart thing, this very, very reliable dependable thing for generations, print. And we watched it die from up on our hill of youth. You kind of get the sense that you\u2019re not safe. That\u2019s coming for you, too, but you don\u2019t know what it looks like for you. That\u2019s kind of bleak, I suppose.\n\nStep Aside, Pops is published by Drawn & Quarterly and Jonathan Cape. Click here to order it.", "source": "Guardian.co.uk"}
