This saga, however, just keeps growing tentacles. There\u2019s no end in sight. \n\nFor Brady, it\u2019s been the kind of roller-coaster ride you don\u2019t ever want to get on. Even though Deflategate was born before the Super Bowl, and didn\u2019t stop the parade, it\u2019s hung over the team, and clung to the Patriots quarterback like the plague. \n\nSince that glorious night in Glendale, Ariz., Brady and the Patriots have had to endure investigations, court appearances, unprecedented sanctions and appeals that didn\u2019t go their way before federal court judge Richard Berman finally overturned the four-game NFL suspension No.\u200912 was hit with for his role in the alleged deflating football scandal. \n\nThen, Tuesday, there was more stuff to digest, more allegations of cheating and more so-called revelations, including a report linking Spygate to Deflategate. \n\nSo this, in a nutshell, is the backdrop for a banner raising ceremony tonight, one that\u2019s expected to be hugely emotional given the drama surrounding Brady, along with the constant attacks questioning the integrity of the organization. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough situation for everyone involved,\u201d special teams captain Matthew Slater said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to handle it as best as we know how and try to move forward.\u201d \n\nMoving forward tonight will mean trying to balance all the emotions of what\u2019s sure to be a moving banner-raising ceremony, along with the pent up frustrations of the past seven months and trying to keep it all in check. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling you can get every year, going out with the team, through the tunnel, and going out into a jacked-up crowd,\u201d tight end Rob Gronkowski said. \u201cI know our crowd\u2019s going to be jacked up. We\u2019re going to be jacked up as a team. I can\u2019t wait for Thursday night. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d \n\nBrady was on point and seemingly in game mode when he spoke at his locker Sunday, talking about the importance of remembering the job at hand. \n\n\u201cI think our guys are excited, but I think mostly we\u2019ve got to focus on what our job is, and that\u2019s to put that celebration behind us and move forward into a new year because it\u2019s different challenges, different teams, different schedule,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAny time you\u2019re in a situation like we\u2019re in, we know that we\u2019re going to get everybody\u2019s best.\u201d \n\nThe Steelers are certainly no slouch. They arrive in Foxboro with one of the best offenses in the business, even without top guns Le\u2019Veon Bell and Martavis Bryant, as the running back and wide receiver, respectively, are serving suspensions. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger & Co. would love nothing better than to spoil the party, and the Pats do have to guard against being overly pumped. \n\nThe players, of course, will be taking their cues from Brady, who this past week has tried to get back into a normal routine, which included breaking his silence. He chose to keep his feelings about the scandal and investigation private, preferring to let his actions on the field speak. \n\nSlater believes that\u2019s where Brady\u2019s message will be sent. \n\n\u201cTom is a sweet man off the football field. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard him say a bad thing about anyone since I\u2019ve known him,\u201d Slater said, \u201cbut when he gets on that football field, I can\u2019t make any promises there. He\u2019s a competitor, and he wants to win. He wants to play well for his team, for the fans, for his family. What you see is what you get.\u201d \n\nBrady put it this way when asked during his weekly appearance on WEEI\u2019s \u201cDennis & Callahan\u201d show, why he was choosing to take the high road and not comment on how badly the NFL bungled the process. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have these conversations every five minutes with every person I see for the first time to tell me what happened or what they thought happened because at the end of the day it takes away from what should be an exciting time for me, for my team, for everyone who has put a lot of time for seven months to get ready through training camp, through preseason games,\u201d Brady said, \u201cand I\u2019ve always felt I wanted to go out on the field and prove it. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always been the place where I\u2019ve been able to go out there and show people how I feel about any circumstance in my life. To go out there and do my job the best that I can.\u201d \n\nCoach Bill Belichick already planted the seeds to try and get this team over carrying the weight of the past, even to the point of saying they\u2019re not defending a title, even if they are defending champs. \n\n\u201cWhat we did last year, once they put the banner up, nothing\u2019s going to change that,\u201d Slater said. \u201cBut this year, it\u2019s a totally new year. Last year has no bearing on this. We\u2019re all starting from the same place. We\u2019ve earned nothing. We\u2019ve done nothing. We have to go out and build our own identity from Week 1 and see what we can do this year. That\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d \n\nWith a lot of baggage stuffed in between.", "source": "Boston Herald"}
