Start-up Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired\u00a0Daraprim, a drug used to treat\u00a0toxoplasmosis, in August. Toxoplasmosis is\u00a0a disease caused by a common parasite\u00a0that can be deadly, especially for those who are immunosuppressed. Turing immediately increased the price of Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750,\u00a0The New York Times reported. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u00a0tweeted\u00a0a link to the story on Monday saying the move was \"outrageous.\" Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h\t\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2015 In an interview with Bloomberg TV's Betty Liu on Monday, the company's CEO Martin Shkreli defended the move, explaining that they\u00a0\"need to turn a profit on the drug.\"\u00a0 Daraprim, which has been around for 62 years, has had multiple owners. Shkreli said that other companies were \"giving it away almost.\" He added that even at $750 per tablet, it's \"still underpriced relative to its peers.\"\u00a0 It\u00a0costs\u00a0very little to make Daraprim, but Shrkeli\u00a0said there are other costs such as distribution costs that have increased over the years. He\u00a0said that they plan to use the money they make from Daraprim for alternative research to make \"a better version\" of the drug. In the meantime, he said if someone can't afford the drug, they will \"give it away totally for free.\" Shkreli, 31, previously ran now-closed MSMB Capital Management, a healthcare-focused hedge fund. Before that, he did stints at Intrepid Capital and Jim Cramer's former firm Cramer Berkowitz & Co, according to his LinkedIn profile.\u00a0He graduated from Baruch College in 2004.
