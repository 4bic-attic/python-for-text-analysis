As you can see from\u00a0this tweet, we were also pleased to be greeted by a display outside of Mr. Fisher's room. \u00a0Mr. Fisher had taken a cue from the recent #bpseduchat with guest host\u00a0AJ Juliani\u00a0and had sought student feedback on what would happen if students were allowed to pick their teacher, investigate topics that they wanted to pursue, etc. It was a great opportunity for the Learning Walk group to read some of the student responses and reflect on the wisdom that they shared especially about the importance of the relationship between the student and the teacher. As always, it was great to get into WJHS classrooms and witness the incredible teaching taking place and observe first hand the amazing talent and intellect of our students. Go Wildcats!
