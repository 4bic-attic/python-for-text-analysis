The preparation was amazing and on-site we got such kind assistance that it helped us easily reach our goals by talking to journalists, doing interviews and making new contacts from all over the world.\" \n \n\"One of our main reasons for participating in IFA was the press coverage. So Showstopper was more important to us than our booth in the fair during the exhibition,\" said Sebastien de la Bastie , managing director, invoxia. \"ShowStoppers made it possible to bring our own fridge and simulate the kitchen environment quickly during the event, which is what we need to properly demonstrate Triby, our connected speakerphone for the kitchen. Most of the journalist we contacted before the show planned to attend Showstopper and we attracted many new press contacts. Publicity on the web started before the end of the show and is still increasing 5 days after the event.\" \n \n\"The thing with ShowStoppers (I've done two, IFA and Mobile World Congress) is they deliver on their promises. They tell you this event will be organized, crowded with reviewers from prominent outlets, as well as bloggers (who can be just as important as the New York Times ), and that the event will be beneficial for your company. At the end of the show you'll make eye contact with Dave or Steve (since they're constantly walking the floor to make everything run smoothly) and nod your head, because they were right. More importantly, they delivered. As you can tell I'm a 'happy customer' of ShowStoppers. I will continue to plan new product launches around their schedule,\" said Erick McAfee , head of Global Business Development, Moov Inc. \n \n\"ShowStoppers has been an integral part of our IFA press activities for quite some years,\" said Mareike Oer , head of Global Public Relations at headphone-maker Sennheiser. \"The 2015 event confirmed once more that the press reception is a great way for us to get in touch with numerous qualified and enthusiastic journalists from all over the world who are eager to discover Sennheiser.\" \n \n\"This was the second ShowStoppers event that Primera Technology joined this year to present our Primera Trio . It was a great opportunity for us to show our new all-in-one portable printer to a great number of German and European editors, journalists and bloggers. Within the three hours we had inspiring conversations, intensive exchange with visitors and fellow exhibitors,\" said Andreas Hoffmann , managing director, Primera Technology Europe. \n \n\"We demonstrated the most advanced and connected hearing aid, ReSound LiNX\u00b2, to many interested journalists and media representatives,\" said Joachim Gast , general manager, GN ReSound Germany. \"A third of those journalists have been \"returners\" from ShowStoppers at IFA 2014 and we used the chance for an update and strengthened our relationship. Two thirds were new contacts, about half of them international journalists. A good number of those new contacts, we did succeed in scheduling additional presentations and interviews.\" \n \n\"For journalists, Showstoppers is a very handy tool and a not to be missed media event at IFA.
