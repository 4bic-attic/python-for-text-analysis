He won\u2019t play in the group stage, I don\u2019t think. I hope he will play again this season.\u201d \n \nThe left-back, who joined United from Southampton in June 2014 for a fee in the region of \u20ac40m, has been one of United\u2019s outstanding players so far this season, earning rave reviews from team-mates and pundits alike. He also featured in England\u2019s last two UEFA EURO 2016 qualifiers as Roy Hodgson\u2019s side confirmed their place in next summer\u2019s finals. \n \n\u201cBefore the start of the campaign Van Gaal said: \u2018I think that this will be the season of Luke Shaw \u2013 that I believe\u2019,\u201d the BBC wrote following the game. \u201cIn a somewhat stodgy start to the new season for United, Shaw had shone as he looked leaner, sharper and more settled than during a mixed first year at Old Trafford.\u201d \n \nShaw earned himself praise from the United manager following his decision \u2013 after a stop-start debut campaign at Old Trafford \u2013 to improve his fitness in the post-season and has reaped the rewards this term, demonstrating a more developed attacking game, an extra turn of pace and signs of a flourishing understanding with new signing Anthony Martial. \n \nEx-United star Owen Hargreaves was in little doubt at how big a blow the loss of Shaw will be to United\u2019s prospects this term: \u201cYou saw Daley Blind playing as a left-back [for the rest of the game] and he can play there, but Shaw\u2019s virtually irreplaceable for this United team.\u201d", "source": "Vanguard"}
