Can we talk about this description? pic.twitter.com/tjaqRY9gs8 \n\u2014 Dr. Adrienne K. (@NativeApprops) September 1, 2015  \n \nAs that tweet\u00a0made its way around Twitter, being retweeted 600+ times, Keene took to her blog to explain exactly what was wrong with the summary. \n \n\u201cThe description reads like a porn or a bad romance novel,\u201d Keene\u00a0 wrote in a blog post . \u201cThe use of \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018yearns is so\u2026 gross. Shudder. The problem? It overly sexualizes the film, and only positions Pocahontas in relation to her romantic options, not as a human being, you know, doing things.\u201d \n \nKeene noted that the movie does partially center around a love triangle, but she also pointed out that Disney movies with male protagnoists aren\u2019t given the same treatment on Netflix.\u00a0The summaries of \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,\u201d \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Groove,\u201d \u201cTarzan,\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d all leave romantic subplots out of the picture. \n \nAfter Keene brought this to the attention of her Twitter followers on Aug. 31, the story started to pick up steam, being covered by MTV , Pacific Standard , and Huffington Post . While Keene received plenty of\u00a0troll-ish responses \u00a0imploring her not to be \u201coffended by everything,\u201d she also received\u00a0support from people who were equally put off by\u00a0Netflix\u2019s description. \n \n @NativeApprops  @netflix YUCK! So disgusted! \n\u2014 Des (@DesiMcRae) September 1, 2015  \n \n @NativeApprops  @deray  @netflix everything about that is wrong \n\u2014 anonymousaspie (@anonymousaspie) September 1, 2015  \n \n @NativeApprops  @netflix What kind of mess is this? \n\u2014 JamaicanBeauty7 (@JBeauty7) September 1, 2015  \n \nThen, on September 8, the summary was changed. A \u201ccopy manager\u201d from Netflix emailed Keene and thanked her for bringing the issue to their attention, according to Keene\u2019s site .\u00a0 \n \n\u201cWe do our best to accurately portray the plot and tone of the content we\u2019re presenting,\u201d he email said, \u201cand in this case you were right to point out that we could do better. The synopsis has been updated to better reflect Pocahontas\u2019 active role and to remove the suggestion that John Smith was her ultimate goal.\u201d \n \nNow, this is what the summary looks like: \n \n\u201cA young American Indian girl tries to follow her heart and protect her\u00a0tribe when settlers arrive and threaten the land she loves,\u201d it reads. \n \n\u201cYoung\u201d is right \u2014 as Keene pointed out in another post , in reality, Pocahontas was only about 10 years old when she met the\u00a0adult John Rolfe (called John Smith in the movie). This is just one of the other aspects of \u201cPocahontas\u201d with which Keene takes issue. \n \nIn her blog post, she seemed satisfied with Netflix\u2019s reaction. \n \n\u201cNot bad, right?? Look at that. From an angry tweet to an actual change in the description,\u201d she wrote . \u201cSometimes I\u2019m still amazed by the power the internet.\u201d \n \nFollow Business Insider Australia on", "source": "Business Insider Australia"}
