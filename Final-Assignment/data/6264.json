Photo: CBS.  \nFor many people, a soothing shower is one of life's luxuries - but not Dave Whitlock, who hasn't showered in 12 years. \n\nThe chemical engineer and MIT graduate wants to preserve the bacteria on his skin - so rather than showering he sprays on Mother Dirt, a mist containing live bacteria, twice a day. \n\nThe mist is manufactured by AOBiome, a company Mr Whitlock helped found. \nThe Mother Dirt mist is odorless and feels so much like water, you won't believe it's not water.

This soil bacteria is the best probiotic for your skin. \n\n\"Many users find they can start reducing showers or incorporate a no soap or reduced soap hygiene routine. \n\nAOBiome's consumer products general manager Jasmina Aganovic said \"we've confused clean with sterile\", The Daily Mail reported . \n\n\"We've taken the dirt out of our lives. We don't spend as much time outdoors as we used to, even little children.\" \n\nMorning news break \u2013 September 7  \n\nVideo  Crisis talks for Syrian migrants, nation farewells racing legend", "source": "West Australian"}
