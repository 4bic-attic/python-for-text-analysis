Sick and tired of maltreatment under their enslavement from man, the animals of Manor Farm revolt. Released from all chains, there is but one key rule: All animals are equal. Yet, as the story progresses we soon see some animals are more equal than others\u2026\u201d Cara for The Guardian\n\n\u201cVery simply, the book is one of the funniest SF spoofs ever written, with hyperbolic ideas folding in on themselves.\u201d School Library Journal\n\n\u201cChinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart is a beautiful novel \u2013 as an extended metaphor for African despoliation, life and politics it works wonderfully. Beautiful is, perhaps, a strange word to describe this essentially melancholic novel but whilst Things Fall Apart is a sorrowful affair it is never a despondent one.\u201d Mark Thwaite\n\nThe Great Gatsby is in many ways similar to Romeo and Juliet yet is so much more than a love story. It also a reflection on the hollowness of a life of leisure.\u201d The Pink Elephant\n\n\u201cTruman Capote is tart as grand aunt, but in his way he is a ballsy little guy, and he is the most perfect writer of my generation, he writes the best sentences word for word, rhythm upon rhythm. I would not have changed two words in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, which will become a small classic.\u201d", "source": "Fourways Review"}
