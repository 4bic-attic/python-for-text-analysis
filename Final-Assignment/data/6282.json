We've offered him the opportunity for a long-term extension,\" Reed said. \n\n\"We'd like to tie him down for another five years. Whether that's possible or not, I don't know but the opportunity is there to do that. \n\n\"He was a little bit unsettled and I think that has to happen probably at most clubs with different players. \n\n\"The speculation does raise a few eyebrows. \n\n\"Maybe it got a little bit too hyped up and maybe Victor thought there was a bit more truth in the rumours than there was. \n\n\"Now it's over, he's gone home to Kenya and I think he'll enjoy some time with his family and come back and be settled and raring to go in our team.\" \n\nGerard Laws Gerard is a sports journalist with an unrelenting love of the world game.
