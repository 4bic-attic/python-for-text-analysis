I love you guys!!!!!\" Kardashian  informed those same followers, captioning a selfie of a sidelong smile and copious cleavage. \n\nWith that tally, the star of \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" and wife of rapper Kanye West now has more followers than any other Instagram user. \n\nPop stars Taylor Swift and Beyonce are close behind at 44.7 million and 44.6 million, respectively, and two other pop stars, Selena Gomez  and Ariana Grande, round out the top five. \n\nInstagram, acquired by Facebook in 2012, is a platform for users to share photos, with little emphasis on text, a format that may be particularly well-suited to Kardashian's particular self-promotion genius. \n\nA photo of newlyweds Kardashian and West kissing at their wedding, posted to her account last year, became the most \"liked\" photo on Instagram before being surpassed by a photo on the account of her younger half-sister, Kendall Jenner, earlier this summer. \n\nKardashian still has plenty of room for improvement on less photo-centric social media; Katy Perry leads all Twitter users with 74.8 million followers, while Kardashian has a mere 34.9 million.", "source": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha"}
