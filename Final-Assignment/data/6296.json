Transportation Security Administration officers screening luggage around 5:45 a.m. discovered a loaded .32-caliber handgun in Timothy Bass' carry-on bag after passing the bag through an X-ray machine, said Lt. Eric Carr, of the Syracuse Police Department. Bass, a member of the U.S. Navy, told police he forgot the weapon was in his bag, Carr said. Bass, of Norwich, Connecticut, was traveling to his base in Honolulu, Hawaii. The sailor did not possess a valid permit for the gun, Carr said.
