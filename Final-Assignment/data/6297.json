In the Bible, Jeremiah laments of the destruction of Jerusalem, a funeral dirge for the loss of a city, rent out in acrostic verse. We recall Tyrtaeus, the first poet of Greek city state, who composed verses in Sparta. Possibly no other poet in post-colonial Africa has mapped a city \u2014 in so few yet so powerful words \u2014 as J.P. Clark in Ibadan. \n \nBabishai Niwe (BN) Poetry Foundation, under the guidance of Beverley Nambozo Nsengiyunva, set out to imagine Kampala through poetry, leading to the publication of Boda Boda Anthem & Other Poems, edited by Mildred K Barya. The poems are grouped into four thematic areas: \u2018Ubuntu\u2019, \u2018Kampala City Y\u2019ani\u2019, \u2018How Do You Say Kampala with an Accent\u2019, and \u2018Marry Me, Kampala\u2019. These are portraits of Kampala, but they are fragmented and produce a shock of the real. They are testimonial and document an age. \n \nThe poem, Boda Boda Anthem, introduces us to the chaos of Kampala. Boda Bodas are imaged as \u2018hordes of demons searching/packs of hounds game hunting/death throttles clamouring for blood\u2019. These Boda Bodas whizz through Kampala\u2019s dust-ridden streets leaving carnage and death in their wake. They pride themselves as the \u2018unbwogable force of renegade commandos\u2019. Unbwogable\u2019 is a word coined from a Luo word \u2018bwogo\u2019 meaning to \u2018scare\u2019 and \u2018unbwogable. means \u2018you can\u2019t scare me\u2019. The term originated from a song by Kenyan rap duo Gidigidi Majimaji. The throttlehold Boda Bodas have on Kampala streets presents a grim picture. One wonders whether Boda Bodas are the cause or the consequence of a city\u2019s (dys)function. One wonders if Boda Bodas are a political metaphor. \n \nIn Larok from Napak, written by Paula Biraaro, Kampala is pictured as a concrete jungle. Katanga, by Ian Kiyingi Muddu, captures degeneration accompanying consumerism: \u2018a/ State-kept /rubbish heap of /Sh*t Condoms Cigarette butts Tots and People/. The narratives of daily surviving the city litter almost every page. In Two Mighty Hills by Musinguzi Ray Robert, we are informed that Kampala is \u2018a city that is no longer safe for a frog\u2019, yet despite the tone of desperation, the poet still \u2018longs for a day when he will/Call Kampala a home of patriots/ Not genuflecting purists.\u2019 Froth, by Mulumba Ivan Matthias, laments the brutality of law enforcers, while Bring then Take, by Cherret Ndiwa Leakey, laments economic dispossession by the Chinese: they \u2018bring in all they can to sell/ they bring in the machines plus the construction materials for the roads./ The Chinese take away all they can\u2019. In U@50 by Paula Biraaro, she asks Kampala: \u2018will you slip into menopausal madness?/ Become a beneficiary of memory lapses,/ Reminiscing about the bush ol\u2019 days?\u2019 \n \nYet Kampala does not kill all her cubs. In Unveiling My Bride Kampala, we find an effusive tone \u2013 coy and seductive: \u2018My beautiful bride Kampala/ You make my heart sing lalala/ My heart cannot stop staring at you... / On you I will spend all my money/ If that would impress you, honey.\u2019 In Rolled Eggs, by Mark Gordon Musinguzi, we are told that \u201cyou have not known the true taste of Kampala until you hold in your hand/ Something more precious that your silver watch, (two chapattis and rolled eggs) a Wandegeya Rolex\u2019. \n \nThere are Two Sides of Kampala: which is also the title of the poem by Kiwanuka George, one is comforting and gives the confidence of an organized, disciplined, and clean ambience, the other embraces the night\u2019s evil veil and sends cold shivers down people\u2019s spine. To some Kampala is a concrete jungle to some, to others it is, the Canaan of matooke and pork to others. But cities are dynamic, perplexing, and uncertain beings and notoriously difficult to map. Cities can be fictions. One is never sure whether the poets talking about Kampala or Uganda? Or Nairobi, Lagos, or Johannesburg? The fact that the anthology features poets from eighteen countries has created a diverse mix of images of Kampala cannot be pigeon-holed into a single interpretive lens. \n \nOne thing is certain though, like A Thousand Voices Rising, this anthology \u2013 Boda Boda Anthem & Other Poems \u2013 is definitive of the rising stature of Kampala as a literature convent and a drinking hole for African poets. \n EDITORS CHOICE   Website Comment Policy  \nThank you for participating in discussions on the Star website. \n \nNote that: \n \n1.
