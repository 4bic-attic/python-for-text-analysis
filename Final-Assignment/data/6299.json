Leanne Butler said a bridge patrol officer came in contact with the man after someone called to let them know he planned to jump off the bridge. \n \nShe said the 28-year-old man got into her vehicle and the patrol officer got out to talk to an RCMP officer who arrived on scene. \n \nButler said the man then slid into the driver's seat and began driving away. At that point, she said a second RCMP officer who approached the vehicle was struck and somehow got hooked on it when he became sandwiched between the bridge and the vehicle. \n \n\"The officer was hit by that vehicle and dragged a considerable distance,\" she said. \"That officer is in hospital with what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries.\" \n \nButler said the patrol vehicle crashed into another patrol car and a civilian vehicle at the New Brunswick end of the bridge, where the man was arrested and taken into custody. \n \nShe said no one was injured in those crashes. \n \nButler said the man from Borden-Carleton was taken into custody and is facing charges related to the incident. \n \nMichel LeChasseur, general manager of the bridge, said it was closed from about 6 a.m. until 10:15 a.m., causing long lineups of cars waiting to get across the span.", "source": "Daily Herald Tribune"}
