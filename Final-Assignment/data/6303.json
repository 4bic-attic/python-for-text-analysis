We hope that Corbyn becomes the next leader of the Labour Party.\u00a0 \n \nHe says that whatever the result is on 12 September, the movement that\u2019s grown is not going away.\u00a0 \n \nWe agree with him\u2014and we cannot wait five more years until we see resistance strong enough to boot the Tories out of office. \n \nThe government\u2019s latest attacks on the NHS and welfare show what\u2019s at stake. \n \nWe need to turn the anger over endless austerity, inequality, racism and war into a force that can give the Tories and bosses a real kicking.\u00a0 \n \nThere\u2019s just a month to go until the demonstration called for 4 October by the Trades Union Congress at the Tory party conference in Manchester. \n \nEvery trade unionist and campaigner should be there with their friends and workmates. \n \nTurnout\u00a0 \n \nTrade unions must pump out publicity and lay on as much transport as possible to ensure a massive turnout of their members and everyone else who wants to come. \n \nWe must push for the demonstration\u2014and the People\u2019s Assembly events surrounding it\u2014to be the springboard for a sustained fightback against the Tories. \u00a0We need marches, occupations, campaigns of defiance and resistance. \n \nBut we have to look to where our side is strongest. Workers\u2019 strikes can hit bosses\u2019 profits. Industrial action will have to be at the heart of the movement.\u00a0 \n \nSome union leaders hope to use the Corbyn campaign to avoid confrontation with the Tories. \n \nTheir preferred choice for Labour leader was Andy Burnham\u2014but now they\u2019ve had to embrace Corbyn. They are much less radical than many of Corbyn\u2019s supporters.\u00a0 \n \nIn the run-up to the general election, the union leaders shut down industrial action and said that we should wait for Labour.\u00a0 \n \nWe cannot let them get away with this.\u00a0 \n \nIf Corbyn gets elected he will face immense pressure from the Labour establishment and bosses to back down from any radical policies.\u00a0 \n \nHe already faces pressure from within his own camp to present an \u201cimage of moderation\u201d.\u00a0 \n \nSo building the movement on the streets and in the workplaces must start now.\u00a0 \n \nThat means marching against the Tories in Manchester\u2014and supporting every working class struggle.", "source": "Socialist Worker"}
