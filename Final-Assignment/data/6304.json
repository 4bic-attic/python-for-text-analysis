The contract marks a further step forward in international expansion into the Americas, following on from projects in Brazil, Colombia, the USA and Canada. \n \nOptaSense will be used for advanced leak detection using its patent pending, \u201c4-mode\u201d leak detection technology. OptaSense will also provide enhanced security monitoring to detect third party intrusion events, as well as ground movement monitoring. \n \nThe integrated solution works across these multiple functions via a single fibre-optic cable that effectively \u201clistens\u201d to the pipeline in order to provide detailed data about its current status. Any changes to the condition of the pipe are fed back through an interrogator unit, allowing users to identify and address issues early and maintain the highest level of pipeline availability and product throughput. \n \nTags: OptaSense", "source": "Scandinavian Oil-Gas Magazine"}
