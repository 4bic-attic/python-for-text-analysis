He\u2019s been fighting guys we don\u2019t know names or how to pronounce or where the hell they came from, they came out of a rabbit box. For him to say that is very laughable for me. \n \n\u201cFor him being the champion for so many years and having done that, then try to talk about opponents for me\u2026he already knows what it\u2019s gonna be when he faces me. Of course, if I fight everybody at the top then that lessens the chance of him having to face me because I feel he wants me to lose to someone so he can have an easier match for him when it\u2019s time for me and him to fight.\u201d \n \nWilder will defend his title against Johann Duhaupas on September 26 from Legacy Arena in Birmingham, Alabama, with televised coverage on NBC. \n  \nSeptember 17th, 2015 \n\n For all the latest boxing news, click here.", "source": "Fightnews.com"}
