She was lodged at the Carter County Detention Center because it is the only area lockup that houses federal inmates. \nShe stopped issuing licenses after a U.S. Supreme Court decision legalized same-sex marriage. Davis said issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples would violate her deeply held religious beliefs, but in order to not discriminate she decided not to issue altogether. \nSteele said while the controversy was swirling around Grayson the city would welcome and protect the rights of both sides of the issue to demonstrate and peacefully protest. \n\u201cEverybody here has a right to be here and we\u2019re going to protect them, but also the opposition, the gay rights activists have a right to be here and we\u2019re going to protect them, too,\u201d Steele said Saturday. \nA front desk clerk at the Fairfield Inn off Interstate 64, who identified herself as a Grayson resident, said rallies surrounding Davis\u2019 incarceration have filled local hotels with occupants the past few days. \nBut despite the good business, the clerk said she is not a fan of the constant media onslaught the town has brought her. \nShe also said the city of Grayson did not do anything to attract the attention, but inadvertently finds itself in the middle of the controversy that should actually be taking place about 40 miles west in Rowan County. \nCarter County Jailer R.W. Boggs said he did his best to conduct \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d while events unfolded outside the jailhouse walls. \nHe said deputies were able to carry out every-day-duties, such as booking inmates and going to court without much interference from the 5,000 or so that rallied for Davis\u2019 release on Tuesday. \n\u201cDuring the rally, it\u2019s amazing the things people didn\u2019t see going on inside the building,\u201d Boggs said Tuesday evening after the crowd dissipated. \u201cWe had a plan together to execute and we made it through this day. When you have the eyes of the national looking upon you and everybody performs well, it\u2019s something Carter County can be proud of.\u201d \nA deputy at the rally said \u201call hands are on deck\u201d for the event, including Grayson Police Department, Olive Hill Police Department, Grayson Fire Department, Carter County Emergency Management Services, Carter County Sheriff\u2019s Department, Carter County Jail and Carter County E911 coordinated security at the event. \nNow that Davis is released from jail, the town is expected to revert back to its normal flow of traffic, but eyes will still be on Davis and the Carter County Detention Center to see if she may find herself back in the sleepy town off Interstate 64. \n\nLANA BELLAMY can be reached at lbellamy@dailyindependent.com or (606) 326-2653.
