Inspired by sport and fashion, the fall 2015 women\u2019s line introduces vivid colors and bold new silhouettes that are built to layer. The modern, streamlined styles are slightly slimmer than previous collections, with flattering overlay tape, smooth jersey facing and finished necklines. Available locally is the Nike Tech Fleece Cape, which features a dramatic, feminine silhouette and includes a cocoon-like hood. Nike Tech Fleece Cape Maria Sharapova The menswear proposition has similarly evolved and features woodland camp camouflage and new proportions \u2014 along with elevated details, like multi-faceted zippered pockets. The Nike Tech Fleece Hoodie extends its rear hem for more coverage and protects its wearer's face with a taller enveloping hood. \u00a0Nike Tech Fleece Men's Hoodie The Fall 2015 Nike Tech Pack Collection featuring Nike Tech Fleece is already available on Nike Sportswear retailers (see list below).
