My name is Andy Sellar and I own a company called Sunny Coast social media,' he said. \n\n'We do viral videos for businesses. Now I know there is going to be a lot of you that are upset by this... maybe not too happy. \n   \nThe video emerged a day after the original video went live and gained traction across the world \n\n'But this young lady was just a volunteer in this. I did all the Facebook, the YouTube, I did all the answering. She had nothing to do with that, she literally was just an actress.' \n\nMr Sellar goes on to reveal why he had engaged in such a campaign. \n\n'We just wanted to put Mooloolaba on the map because it's a wonderful place. So thank you for watching and we are going to do many, many more videos like this,' he explained.\u00a0 \n\nEarlier on Wednesday, speculation was mounting about whether or not Ms Amyot was real and if her story was fake. \n\nMr Foster told Daily Mail Australia Ms Amyot was Alizee Michele who he went to university with.\u00a0 \n\n'I was on campus of the Sunshine Coast for seven years and was friends with [her] and her friends for a few years because I ran most the functions on campus and off for the university accommodation\u00a0and my events\u00a0company that I put together while I was at uni,' he said. \n\nMr Foster also revealed Ms Michel had a long-term boyfriend who lived with her at Alexandra Headland - a suburb of Mooloolaba - during her time in Australia. \n\nMr Foster said as far as he knew the 26-year-old was still with her boyfriend last year.\u00a0 \n\n'The story is definitely not true,' Mr Foster added.\u00a0 \n\nAdding to the speculation was a photograph taken back in June 2014 identifying a woman who bore a remarkable resemblance to Ms Amyot as Ms Michel. \n   \nOnline sceptics thought Ms Amyot was in fact former University of the Sunshine Coast student Alizee Michel (left) \n   \nIn her Tuesday video, Ms Amyot claimed she had holidayed in Mooloolaba on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and spent her last night with a blue-eyed tanned man who she fell instantly in love with \n\nIn the picture, Ms Michel is posing with two other friends on the beach at Mooloolaba.\u00a0 \n\nOn social media, she was also tagged with a relative believed to be her cousin in Melbourne months before she claimed to have arrived in Australia for her extended trip. \n\nA further search on Facebook lists a number of Ms Michel's relatives as living in the Victorian capital. \n\nThe 26-year-old made international headlines when she posted\u00a0a video onto Facebook and YouTube claiming she had returned home only to discover six weeks later she was pregnant following their one-night stand. \n\nMs Amyot said she had spent 'a beautiful night' with a 'really cute' man and she fell instantly in love. \n\nBut her love story immediately drew skepticism from many viewers, with some questioning on social media why the lovestruck woman  did not know more about the mystery man - like his name. \u00a0 \n\nOn Tuesday, she appeared to have second thoughts about whether the man will see her again after her video grabbed global headlines. \n\n'I'm shaking now I'm in crying now......what if he doesn't want to see me now, maybe he is shy.... am so lonely right now [sic],' she tearfully wrote on Facebook on Tuesday night. \n   \nShe claimed she had fallen pregnant after the one-night stand and even went on to keep up the ruse on her social media account, saying she would be at Mooloolaba's One Up Bar at 7pm on Wednesday \n   \nHere in this Facebook photograph Ms Michel is tagged in Melbourne with a relative thought to be her cousin \n\n'Please .i didn't think it would be on news...i just want to see him again...sorry..i have nothing left if i don't find him ill go home...i just want to see ..if he says no then ok...is that wrong?
