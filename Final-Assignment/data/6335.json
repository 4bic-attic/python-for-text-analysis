It is estimated that a 20 minute reduction in the journey time could increase wages by up to 2.7 per cent. \n\nIn July, The Yorkshire Post launched its Back on Track campaign calling for the reinstatement of the proposed electrification of the Trans-Pennine railway line, after the plan was halted in the weeks following the General Election. \n\nResearch by the IPPR suggests that if the North had matched the national increase in economic output per head since 2003 then its economy would be \u00a35 billion bigger, a 1.8 per cent increase. \n\nIt adds that if the three regions making up the North reversed their net outflow of people to other regions then, by 2030, its population would be 264,000, or 1.6 per cent, higher than currently forecast. \n\nIPPR North says there is \u201cmassive potential for businesses\u201d in the North to \u201cgrow and drive the nation\u2019s prosperity and productivity\u201d but that this can only be achieved by investment. \n\nIt said: \u201cMany of the conditions are in place for the northern economy to experience a period of economic growth at a scale not seen since the Victorian era of grand municipal development. \n\n\u201d \n\nEarlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the \u2018Northern Powerhouse\u2019 scheme to rebalance the UK economy by better connecting the towns and cities of the North while devolving decision-making powers away from London. \n\nBut this week the Government was accused of failing to live up to its pledge to end the North-South divide after a report revealed just how little of the country\u2019s infrastructure investment is set to go outside London. \n\nThe capital is set to receive more funding for major projects that all the others English regions combined, and six times more per head of population than Yorkshire and the Humber, according to the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute. \n\nEd Cox, Director of IPPR North, said: \u201cThe historical economic under-performance of the north of England is not natural, nor is it inevitable. We have seen past attempts at \u2018regional policy\u2019 fall by the wayside, but the Northern Powerhouse has momentum and has galvanised leaders in the North. \n\n\u201cBut investment, leadership and urgency ar\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
