It\u2019s their job to\u00a0explain the benefits of OneDrive for Business, which is ideally suited to mobile business owners, sales professionals or field-based employees. \n \n\u201cThey start to develop business needs and as they grow and add employees, they need to share business information,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cOneDrive for Business is ideal for that. Customers have to get used to this way of working instead of having everything stored on the desktop. \n \nSunrise will look to launch the full Office 365 suite to its SOHO customers in early 2016. \n     \r \r \r\n\r   \r \r    \r \r    \r \r    \r \r    \r \r         Share", "source": "Business Plus Online"}
