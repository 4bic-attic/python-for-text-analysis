The 450kg units are buried out of site beneath the famous cobbled piazza and are raised out of the ground when required by a turning handle. When not in use the units do not impact on the historic appearance of the Piazza as they are barely noticeable. \n\nCovent Garden Technical Services Team needed a power solution for temporary stalls and events that are put on throughout the year. The solution was Pop Up Power\u00ae retractable service units, providing pop up electric sockets, located near to the Transport Museum and next to the Portico of St Paul\u2019s Church in the Piazza. The flip top power units provide a safe, efficient and stable outdoor power supply. \n\nThe Covent Garden Services team staff now has access to a combination of 16A and 32A sockets in both single and three phase all with RCBO protection. \n\nPop Up Power\u00ae also supply electricity through In-Ground Units with flip lids and Power Bollards in a variety of designs to suit the surroundings. \n\nAbout Us: \n\nPop Up Power Supplies\u00ae Ltd supply retractable services supply units that provide electricity, water and air supply to public spaces, ranging from historic sites and market places to town squares and parks.
