These licensable IP solutions can reduce power SERDES consumption by 50% and more over other alternatives, while concurrently supporting multiple standards such as PCIe Gen3/4, HMC 2.0, 10G-KR and others - across a range of speeds. These products simplify SOC integration for multi-standard applications while also dramatically reducing power consumption, reducing risk and providing increased product flexibility. Furthermore, Analog Bits will be demonstrating IP products designed for TSMC's 16nm FinFET process technology. \n\nWHAT: Half-power, multi-protocol SERDES IP products\n\nSERDES IP Products\n\nClocking IP Products\n\nSensors IP Products\n\nAbout Analog Bits: Founded in 1995, Analog Bits, Inc. (www.analogbits.com), is the leading supplier of mixed-signal IP with a reputation for easy and reliable integration into advanced SOCs.
