Wells Journal: Pediatric Dentistry, Infancy Through Adolescence, 5th Ed Date: 2012 Major Topic: Type of Article: Background information and expert opinion Main Purpose: Provides expert with Key Points/Summary: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epidemiology: \u2022 By age 11 years, over 40% of children have had dental caries in their primary teeth, and over 20% have had caries in their permanent teeth. \u2022 Over 50% of third graders have experienced dental caries, ranging from 40% (Connecticut) to 75%(Arizona). \u2022 Approximately 23% of children have untreated primary tooth decay and 11% have untreated caries in the permanent dentition. \u2022 The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth increased significantly from 24% to 28% for 2-5 y/o. \u2022 By age 17 years, nearly 78% of children have experienced tooth decay, and by age 19 years, approximately 10% have lost at least one permanent tooth to caries. \u2022 Pit and fissure morphology provides an environment for plaque retention and bacteria proliferation. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sealant Effectiveness: \u2022 Reduction of caries incidence in children and adolescents after one-time placement of resin-based sealants ranges from 86% at 1 year to 78% at 2 years to 58% at 4 years. \u2022 When reapplied as needed, sealants are effective in reducing occlusal caries incidence in permanent first molars of children with reductions of 76% at 4 years. \u2022 Sealants are retained well on primary molars at a rate of 74% to 96% at 1 year and 70% to 76% at almost 3 years. \u2022 Compared with teeth without sealants, teeth that receive sealants are less likely to receive subsequent restorative treatment. If restorative treatment is required, the time until the first restorative treatment is greater than that for unsealed molars, and the restoration is likely to be less extensive. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How Sealants Work: \u2022 Three types of materials are used as sealants: resin, glass ionomer, and polyacid-modified resins. \u2022 The most commonly accepted material is the resin-based sealant due to superior retention rates compared with GI sealants. \u2022 Glass ionomer sealants have a different bonding mechanism. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Filler content: \u2022 The theory is that unfilled sealants will penetrate deeper into the fissures because of their low viscosity, create longer resin tags, and therefore be better retained. Data from one study suggest that unfilled sealants are retained better. Also in unfilled sealant occlusal adjustment is not necessary. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fluoride releasing Sealants: \u2022 Based on the knowledge of the benefits of fluoride release from GI materials, dental manufacturers have also developed fluoride-releasing resin sealants. However, studies have shown that salivary fluoride levels are the same before and after sealant placement, and there is no long-lasting release of fluoride to plaque and saliva. Additionally, clinical studies have not demonstrated significant caries prevention of fluoride-releasing sealants over those benefits obtained from conventional sealants. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which teeth? \u2022 Traditionally, noncarious first and second permanent molars with deep fissures were the candidates for sealants. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sealant over the incipient caries: \u2022 Sealants are applied properly and are monitored periodically, caries arrest beneath a sealant. Sealant application significantly decreases the viable bacteria in pits and fissures. Acid etching alone eliminates 75% of the viable microorganisms. It reduces the number of carious lesions that progress. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using bonding Agents: \u2022 Bond strength is significantly greater when a bonding agent is used with sealant rather than placing sealant alone on clean enamel. Hypomineralized teeth need to be re-treated with sealant application after a much shorter time. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 School-based sealant program: \u2022 An important and effective public health approach that complements clinical care systems in promoting the oral health of children and adolescents Assessment of Article:\u00a0 Level of Evidence/Comments: Level III", "source": "St. Joseph Literature Review"}
