I want France to remain France. I don\u2019t want France to become Muslim.\u201d \n \nThe 51-year-old EU lawmaker from eastern France, one of Sarkozy\u2019s closest supporters for years and a former minister, insisted she had said nothing wrong. \n \nSarkozy aides said on initially that he disagreed with her comments but did not plan any sanctions. \n \nHowever, as the controversy grew on Wednesday and local officials asked for her departure, he decided to cut her from the party\u2019s list of candidates. \n \n\u201cHer latest comments do not correspond to what France is or to the values supported by The Republicans,\u201d Sarkozy said in a statement. \u201cAll those who seek to attract publicity that harms The Republicans\u2019 credibility must understand there will be consequences.\u201d \n \nHer eviction from the party\u2019s election ticket is set be rubber-stamped by its election committee at a date that has not been announced yet. \n \nEquality between citizens regardless of race and religion is such a deeply ingrained principle in France that statistics based on ethnicity are illegal. \n \nAt the same time, as a diverse country that hosts Europe\u2019s largest Muslim population, ethnicity and immigration have become important political issues. \n \n(Reporting by Ingrid Melander; Additional reporting by Sophie Louet; Editing by Andrew Callus) \n \neuronews provides breaking news articles from Reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.", "source": "EuroNews"}
