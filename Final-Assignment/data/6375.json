Paul Gorman alleges that Westwood filled her autobiography with sections lifted from his 2001 book The Look: Adventures in Rock and Pop Fashion. Gorman said the paperback edition of Vivienne Westwood, published last week, contains 27 citations acknowledging him and his book, up from eight citations in the hardback edition. Publishers Picador said citations missing in error had been added to the paperback but rejected Gorman\u2019s plagiarism claims. Gorman said the concession does not change his plans to take Westwood, one of the key figures in the punk movement, to court. He maintains that more than 40 passages were taken from The Look, representing a \u201csubstantial copyright infringement\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got so far down the road and I\u2019ve been proved right thus far,\u201d Gorman told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s been really stressful. But the fact they\u2019ve made these changes, it\u2019s a victory, but it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\nGorman, who is writing a biography of Malcolm McLaren, former Sex Pistols manager and Westwood\u2019s ex-partner, said he believes the changes acknowledge \u201ctheft\u201d of his work. \u201cWhile I am pleased that acknowledgment of the theft of my work has begun, I am keeping my options open, not least since I am out of pocket to the tune of several thousands of pounds in legal costs,\u201d he said in a statement on his website. \u201cIn fact, it seems to me that this turn of events bolsters my case.\u201d A spokeswoman for Pan Macmillan and Picador said: \u201cWe always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and, where appropriate, correct them.\n\u201cAs far as Mr Gorman\u2019s legal claim is concerned, the matter is being dealt with by our solicitors, who have written to his solicitors rejecting his unjustified claims.\u201d", "source": "UK news | The Guardian"}
