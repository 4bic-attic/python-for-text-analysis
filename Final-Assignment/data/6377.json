An unidentified military officer comes on between cartoons and a football show to announce the government and parliament are no more. \n\nThat is the scenario that played out this week in Burkina Faso, signaling that the country\u2019s old regime, a government that had clung to power for 27 years under former president Blaise Compaore, was essentially back, despite his toppling in mass protests last year. \n\nThe coup leader, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, is Compaore\u2019s right-hand man and former chief of staff, a fellow with a finger in every pie in a region teeming with terrorist groups, kidnappers, arms dealers and smugglers. \n\nHe has also been close to U.S. and French security agencies and a key counter-terrorism ally. In fact he appears in his red beret on the U.S. military\u2019s Africa Command center website, as a leader in the 2010 U.S. counter-terrorism training exercise in West Africa. (The coup has been condemned by U.S., French, U.N. and African Union officials.) \n\nWith Diendere in charge, questions inevitably rose as to whether Compaore was behind it. Or was it just other top members of the former regime, who were banned from contesting elections scheduled for Oct. 11, and wanted to engineer an election they could win? \n\nHow did Burkina Faso, a valued if not very democratic Western ally, go from being one of the region\u2019s most stable countries to one of its messiest within a year? \n \nThe unpopular Compaore and his increasingly corrupt government were ousted in a revolution last October over his disputed bid to extend his term yet another five years. The country was being ruled on a temporary basis by Interim President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Lt. Col. Yacouba Isaac Zida, who were ousted in the coup. \n\nTheir ouster threatens to launch a bloody fight for power with neither side willing to give ground. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high risk. There\u2019s already reports of shootings. It seems likely it could get worse,\u201d said Paul Melly, an analyst with Chatham House, a London think tank. \n\nThere were local reports that the presidential security force that seized power had opened fire on protesters, killing at least one person and wounding dozens, with some reports of higher casualties. \n\n\u201cBasically, everyone will be horrified,\u201d Melly said, referring to West African and Western leaders. \u201cThis is a complete disaster. It\u2019s not what anybody thinks should happen in Burkina Faso.\u201d \n\nCompaore has a reputation as a tough politician, but if he thinks he can come floating back after a coup, \u201che must be more stupid than I thought he was,\u201d Melly said, adding it was more likely an attempt by former regime heavyweights to engineer an election on their terms. \n\n\u201cTo be honest, I expected something would happen, but I thought it would be more subtle,\u201d said Cynthia Ohayon, a Burkina Faso analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, an analytical group. \u201cThis is a typical old-style coup. It\u2019s like we\u2019re back in the 1980s. We thought this kind of old-style coup can\u2019t happen anymore because of international pressure. But apparently it can.\u201d \n  \nIn short form, what went wrong is this: Compaore tried to cling to power and was ousted a year ago after street demonstrations by a mass movement called Citizens Broom. A year-long transition to elections was set up, Compaore allies were arrested, then parliament passed a law in April banning former regime members from running in the presidential election \u2013 forgetting perhaps the old guard\u2019s strong links with the military. \n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the political strength to force through the level of political reform they wanted to,\u201d said Melly. \n\nCalls by a national reconciliation commission to abolish the powerful presidential security regiment, a 1,300-strong military unit stuffed with Compaore loyalists, seem to have been the last straw -- so the regiment launched its coup. \n\n\u201cClearly they seized power to preserve the interests of the old regime,\u201d said Ohayon. \u201cThey never accepted they lost power, because power means access to money and resources. They weren\u2019t going to have the possibility to regain power through the ballot box so they went to another strategy, the strategy to use force.\u201d \n\nThe coup comes with democracy being whittled back in some parts of Africa, as leaders ditch constitutional term limits to stay in power, often for decades. The Ugandan and Zimbabwean presidents have ruled since the 1980s; Burundi is edging toward civil war after the president insisted on a third term; and the presidents of Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo seem set to ditch the constitutional limit so they can stay on. \n\nUnless the Burkina Faso coup leaders back down and a compromise deal is reached, the impoverished, landlocked country will doubtless be stripped of the Western aid it is utterly dependent on, risking collapse. \n\nGiven its location at the edge of one of the most dangerous terrorist belts in Africa, no one wants Burkina Faso to fall apart. Enormous international pressure will be placed upon both sides to settle the crisis. \n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s coup might look old style, but West Africa has changed in the last few decades and African leaders stand firm against military coups, though they\u2019re more forgiving of rigged elections. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d said Ohayon. \u201cThe military is going to have to compromise. The other side will also have to compromise. The elections will have to be held eventually. The question is what the electoral conditions would be.\u201d \n\nThe coup leader, Diendere said next month\u2019s election should be delayed and criticized the election code, the Associated Press reported. \n\nAlthough Compaore and figures in the former regime have close links to the Ivory Coast political elite, Melly said Burkina Faso, which relies on transport routes through it and other neighboring countries, would be unlikely to withstand sanctions for long. Moreover, the West African single currency bloc could simply freeze its banking system, making it impossible to pay the army. \n\n\u201cIf initial negotiations break down at some point, then some very serious sanctions levers could be applied. Some may think they would be able to hang on. They could become a criminal outlaw regime making deals with trans-Saharan drug smugglers and so on, but it\u2019s hard to see how they could make it stick indefinitely,\u201d Melly said.", "source": "Los Angeles Times"}
