This is very exciting, we have very old carpet in our rooms and tired walls. \u00a0 As much as I am excited about the new look, I am worried. \u00a0Painting starts this Friday and goes through the end of October. Flooring will be done in November. The day before the painting we will move into a empty classroom that is not in use this year. \u00a0Everything has to come off the walls. It's a Preschool classroom and there is a lot on the walls. \u00a0It is daunting. What comes down must go back up. Although we can scale down what is on the walls. \u00a0Our room is scheduled to be painted started October 2, we pack up and move the day before. \u00a0We only need to take bedding, extra clothes, file boxes and few other things. \u00a0We move back on the 6th and the next day is our annual Pumpkin Patch Field trip. \u00a0The following week are the conferences. Field trip, conferences and all the prep in itself makes for a busy month. Throw in painting and new flooring it is overwhelming. I am most worried about conferences preparation. \u00a0We have a very busy class and that is where my focus has been. With the class, improving my circle times, and building relationships with the children. I am really behind. I am worried. I really hope I don't have a sleepless night. Friday is in-service, after some professional training I will work on the DRDP's. We have weekly prep but I will not have any for the next two weeks. \u00a0\nOn the hone front.....I was so upset with my son when I arrived home I vacuumed the house to vent except I yelled at him before I vacuumed. I finished, cooked dinner, ate and apologized. \u00a0I am not a perfect housekeeper but come on can't we be a little more neater and put things away? I am gone from 6:50 A.M. until 6 P.M. I want to come home to a somewhat tidy house. \u00a0I am not expecting a Martha Stewart kind of house but just a little more picked up.\u00a0 \u00a0On the church front....I am the administrator for our website and I successfully change the template from Spring to Fall and made a couple of small changes.\u00a0 And that is that.......
