Camille Delamarre\u2019s \u201cThe Transporter Refueled\u201d is absolutely none of those things, and yet the two films share an unlikely number of similarities. Both are fourth installments in franchises that scarcely seemed able to support a third; both feature recast, taciturn leads who must safeguard four scantily clad women on a dangerous road trip; and both express single-minded devotion \u2014\u00a0in their own radically different fashions \u2014\u00a0to stripping the action movie of its pretensions and excess fat. The rare stupid genre film that\u2019s at least somewhat aware of its own transcendent stupidity, yet not aware enough to wink at it or try to explain it away, \u201cThe Transporter Refueled\u201d will likely rack up modest figures over a sleepy Labor Day weekend, but those who show up will find one of the most enjoyable bad movies of the year. With longtime star Jason Statham sitting this one out, Ed Skrein (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) takes on the role of Frank Martin, the fastest, fightingest Uber driver in Europe. Attempting to make up in pursed-lipped handsomeness what he lacks in charisma and hulking machismo, Skrein isn\u2019t exactly a like-for-like replacement. Fortunately, Frank is ultimately a passenger on this particular ride, with the real attractions being the crashes, the physics-defying brawls, and the nonstop, almost endearingly shameless product placements, with Evian, American Express and especially Audi getting as much screentime as the film\u2019s nominal star. Also, photocopying several pages from \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\u201d the film joins Frank with his vinegary father, Frank Sr. (Ray Stevenson), a self-professed salesman who has not-so-secretly just retired from espionage work. (And judging by the frequency with which he seems to get kidnapped, not a moment too soon.) Father and son are enjoying some RR in Monaco when Frank gets a new client for his clandestine courier service: a femme fatale named Anna (Loan Chabanol). When Frank shows up for his scheduled pickup outside a bank, Anna and her two identically dressed, identically blonde-wigged compatriots (Gabriella Wright, Wenxia Yu) emerge, holding Frank at gunpoint when he tries to call off the job. In the midst of a subsequent city-wide chase, Frank soon learns that the girls have a fourth co-conspirator (Tatiana Pajkovic) who is holding his father captive, and will kill him unless Frank guides them through a series of follow-up heists over the next several hours. Modeling themselves after the Three Musketeers (they even keep a library copy of Dumas\u2019 book conspicuously lying around their hideout, in case their hostages should miss the homage) the girls turn out to be former child sex slaves of Monaco\u2019s reigning\nArticle source: http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/transporter-refueled-review-1201584645/ Related", "source": "EntertainmentNutz"}
