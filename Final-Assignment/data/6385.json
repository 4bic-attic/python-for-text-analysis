Gardner enjoys unflinching bipartisan support in the New Hampshire legislature and is a revered figure in the state\u2019s tight-knit political community, which has long bolstered his efforts to keep New Hampshire's primary first.\u00a0 \n \nThough he typically seeks to downplay any budding conflicts with other states and with the major political parties, Gardner frequently turns to history to help make his case that New Hampshire\u2019s special status isn\u2019t going to change any time soon. \n \nIn the interview with HuffPost, for instance, Gardner noted that prior to the 1984 election, it was the Democratic National Committee who threatened to take away New Hampshire\u2019s delegates at that year's Democratic National Convention if the state refused to give up its first-in-the-nation status. \n \nUltimately, the DNC backed down. \n \n\u201cThe state has paid for this primary all of these years and never took it from any other state,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe have a good record of picking who ends up being president.\" \n \nPreibus\u2019s comments to National Journal came as the Republican Party is once again facing down the prospect of an extended, debilitating nominating fight that it had sought to avoid after losing\u00a0its second straight presidential election in 2012.\u00a0 \n \nHe raised the prospect of creating a \u201crotating primary process\u201d that would last about ten weeks and said the issue would be \u201cfront and center\u201d when the RNC\u2019s Rules Committee meets at next summer\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \n \nGardner, however, sounded unimpressed by these designs as he gears up for the latest iteration of the New Hampshire primary, which he is likely to set for the second Tuesday in February.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cIf the primary is on February 9, it will be the first time in my years that we have had a primary that was not out of compliance with either one or both of the parties,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cOther states have passed laws saying they\u2019re going to do it, too. But it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d", "source": "Huffington Post"}
