It drops off the table quickly after 29. \n \n\n \nWatch that dark green line dive. Votto once told me\u00a0 he wanted to have a swing percentage like Joe Mauer , which is saying something, since only two regulars in the past five years have swung less than Mauer. Mauer\u2019s career swing rate is 37.9%, and Votto\u2019s this year is 37.5%. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d was Votto\u2019s response to the update on his swing rate. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I want.\u201d \n \nThe only problem with just not swinging is that it takes fear to get walks. Pitchers upped their fastball usage last year with him hurt, and Votto heard from everyone that he should be \u201c attacked \u201d in the zone. So getting his swing right enough to drive the ball was probably step one. \n \nVotto evaluates his swing on feel and results, like most hitters, but the way he talks about it might not sound like most hitters. \u201cI want things to feel a certain way in my body when I hit, and I want to see the ball go a certain way off my bat,\u201d he says. \n \nThat direction is important to him. \u201cI want it coming off in a true line,\u201d Votto says, but he also wants to \u201cspray the ball all over the field so that [he\u2019s] more difficult to defend.\u201d Early in the season, even as he was raking, he didn\u2019t like some of the results. \u201cI have to be unpredictable in the infield and outfield,\u201d the first baseman said. \u201cA lot of my outs early on in the season were ground-ball outs to the right side, and that was a big part of my problem.\u201d \n \n Joey Votto 2015 Batted Ball Mix By Halves     Monthly  GB/FB  LD%  Pull%  Cent%  Oppo%  Soft%  Med%  Hard%    1st Half  1.33  23.5%  41.1%  34.4%  24.5%  9.5%  55.6%  34.9%    2nd Half  1.19  25.5%  31.7%  40.9%  27.5%  8.5%  45.1%  46.5%      \nThis focus on using the whole field sounds like something we\u2019ve heard before from Votto, but this year, when he cut his pull rate even more in the second half and went Full Votto , the key was finding a way to take even inside pitches the other way. \n \n\u201cIf it\u2019s in, especially deep in the count, typically when I can\u2019t take a pitch, I\u2019m still willing to hit the inside pitch to the middle of the field,\u201d said the Canadian slugger. \u201cThe key is how close I can get that barrel to my body. Part of that is choking up. If I shorten my 34-inch bat to 31 inches by choking up, all of a sudden the barrel is three inches closer to my body. The second part is\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m steep as much as I\u2019m willing to keep my elbows tight as I swing, and I\u2019m willing to pull my hands in as close as possible as I swing. That majorly zaps power, but for me I have a chance to put the ball in play, I have a chance to hit the ball to the left part of second base in the air, and there\u2019s only one fielder over there, and I have the power to hit the ball over the shortstop\u2019s head.\u201d \n \nTake a look at what Votto did with pitches that within three inches of the line that marks the inside part of the plate before the All-Star game (left) and then later in the season (right). \n \n\n \nYou\u2019re going to pull the ball on pitches inside sometimes, so that red spot on the ground is unavoidable, to an extent. But look at how he shifted his balls in play in the outfield over towards shortstop. That\u2019s impressive. \n \nIt might work for Votto, but here\u2019s one case where the narrative might not fit. It turns out that your pull rate has little to say about how you age. Using the delta method he describes here , Jeff Zimmerman created an aging curve for pull hitters (top 20% by pull rate, over 45% balls in play to the pull field) and it looks like, if anything, pull hitters can provide a little more value late in their careers compared to the rest of the population. \n \n\n \nWhat this doesn\u2019t control for is the fact that many opposite-field hitters have little power, and many pull hitters do have power. And though isolated power ages poorly , that\u2019s a measure that includes speed. Given what we know about shifts and defense, it\u2019s certainly still possible that \u2014 given equal power \u2014 the all-fields approach is a better one for longevity. At least it\u2019s been great for Votto this year. \n \n\u201cIt was a good start to the season,\u201d Votto admitted, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t confident that that swing was repeatable, especially as I fatigued and pitchers made adjustments to me.\u201d So Votto talks about the feel of his swing, as well. \n \n\u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m not swaying forward and backwards and up and down too much,\u201d Votto said about the mechanics of his swing. \u201cI\u2019d rather move up and down than forwards and backwards. My April and May video you\u2019ll see a lot of swaying because I wasn\u2019t bracing with my back leg enough, part of the process of trusting my leg again. When I moved along, I was moving less forward and backwards and more up and down. If you look at Miguel Cabrera , Bryce Harper , those guys are picture perfect when it comes to their ability to slightly load back but also sit down and load into their body, and you can see this coiling action, and then to brace against it and turn the bat through, that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d \n \nThe body is the engine of age. That hurt knee counts, since injuries happen more with age , but players also generally get bigger and slower as they age. And hitters that show some speed age better than others. So Votto has lost some weight, as he admitted in this fun exchange. \n \nSarris: So this part is a little silly. Your speed score is up, you\u2019re stealing some bases\u2026 you look\u2026 are your pants tighter ? \n \nVotto: Much tighter. I\u2019ve lost like seven pounds. \n \nSarris: You looooook\u2026 different. You almost look like a soccer player or something? \n \nVotto: That\u2019s a compliment. \n \nSarris: It\u2019s fit, but in a way that\u2019s not necessarily what you think of when you think of baseball. \n \nVotto: I was tired of wearing pajamas. I would look at guys and they\u2019re wearing sweatpants and hoodies. \n \nSarris: Are we athletes or what? \n \nVotto: I get it. People can wear what they want. But I prefer wearing it this way now. I just feel like I\u2019m good. I\u2019ve lost weight. \n \nSarris: Is that natural in-season weight loss? \n \nVotto: No, offseason work and some changes to diet and lifestyle. I feel great. I feel really good. \n \nBy getting slimmer and rediscovering some of this athleticism, Votto is putting himself closer to being on both of these better aging curves from Jeff Zimmerman \u2014 he\u2019s both a young old player with great plate discipline, as well as a relatively speedy player. \n \n\n \nVotto doesn\u2019t care about stolen bases. He knows that they\u2019re relatively unimportant to overall production \u2014 and this year\u2019s stolen bases are \u201cjust Billy [Hamilton], the back end of double-steals and a few off of people where nobody\u2019s looking\u201d \u2014 but he does care about aging well. So he lost some weight and got fitter. \n \nThe last part of aging well is having the right mental approach at the plate. While pitchers don\u2019t hit their spots regularly \u2014 \u201cI watch video, those [guys] miss all the time\u201d \u2014 and so location is hugely important in the decision to swing. It\u2019s not good enough to look only for pitches in one spot. \u201cWhen it gets more specific is either against the more predictable guys, or the tougher guys. I do location and then pitch. Against some of the tougher left-handed pitchers, I have to pick a pitch because I\u2019m not good enough to hit both pitches. Jeremy Affeldt , I can\u2019t hit the fastball and the curveball, there\u2019s such an enormous gap between the two. So I\u2019ll just look for one or the other and decide on the next pitch what to do.\u201d \n \nBut Votto agreed that just guessing right doesn\u2019t mean you have to swing. He praised Brandon Moss for saying the same . \u201cThat\u2019s a high level of analysis, it\u2019s tough to be able to guess properly, to be able to guess accurately and then still not swing,\u201d Votto said. \u201cPart of my thinking process is not only what I\u2019m looking for but where I want to start and what direction it should go \u2014 a visualization of swing and visualization of pitcher error, and what errors I could potentially make. I\u2019ve swung so often in my career and made so many mistakes I\u2019m like \u2018don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Do this, do this, okay.\u201d \n \nDoes that sound like a lot to be thinking about at the plate? \u201cIt helps to simplify it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s when I get out of the box and ask the umpire for time out. I just need a second.\u201d Ahem . \n \nThis sort of thinking will lead to swinging less at outside pitches, to take this back to Votto\u2019s Mauerian effort. But, as Jeff Sullivan pointed out, he\u2019s also swinging less at pitches inside the zone, particularly at high pitches. \u201cI\u2019m not going to swing at pitches before two strikes that I feel I could fail on,\u201d laughed Votto. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy taking pitches like that. No, you can\u2019t cover all quadrants of the zone. You certainly can\u2019t. You have two strikes, you have to match up your best skills with the pitchers\u2019 likeliest pitches within those two strikes. I don\u2019t see a lot of pitchers that throw a lot of high fastballs to start off at-bats. If, all of a sudden, that becomes a trend, I\u2019ll become a high ball hitter.\u201d \n \nAnd it\u2019s this sort of prism through which Votto sees baseball. You have to make the most of your strengths within the most likely outcomes that baseball provides, which includes trends within the game as well as the realities of aging. For him, this year, it\u2019s meant losing weight, finding the feeling in his legs, laying off the outside pitch and the high pitch, and driving everything to center field, regardless of pitch location.", "source": "FanGraphs Baseball"}
