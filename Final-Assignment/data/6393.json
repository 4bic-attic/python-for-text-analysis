On Thursday they started a sit-down protest on a hillside near the border with Syria and Iraq after their path was blocked by soldiers with riot shields, party officials said. \n \nCizre has been under curfew since last week due to fighting with PKK militants there. HDP politicians say they want to bring attention to what they describe as dire security and health conditions in the town. \n \n\u201cThe government should not be allowed to get away with what is being done today in Cizre,\u201d Demirtas said in a telephone interview broadcast by IMC TV, promising to \u201ccarry Cizre\u2019s voice to the world\u201d. \n \nHe was accompanied by Turkey\u2019s European Union Minister Ali Haydar Konca and Development Minister Muslum Dogan, both from the HDP and members of an interim cabinet steering the country to a snap parliamentary election on Nov. 1. \n \nProsecutors in Diyarbakir, the region\u2019s largest city, launched investigations into Demirtas on Wednesday on charges of terrorist propaganda, inciting crime, and insulting the Turkish state and president. A request was made to lift the immunity from prosecution which Demirtas has as an MP, prosecutors said. \n \nErdogan has also stepped up the pressure on HDP , repeating accusations it was linked to the PKK , which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and United States. \n \n\u201cIf you take the side of terror you will run the risk of paying the price for that,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cThis political movement has begun to present a completely illegal appearance\u201d. \n \nTurkish courts have in the past closed down pro-Kurdish parties on charges of links to the PKK . \n \nResponding to the investigations and Erdogan\u2019s comments, Demirtas said the legal probe was politically motivated and thousands of similar investigations had been launched in the past against pro-Kurdish politicians. \n \n\u201cThis is part of the campaign to undermine the HDP on the order of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the president says, we are ready to pay the price. Our lives are not more valuable than the freedom struggle of our people.\u201d \n \nThe PKK launched its separatist insurgency in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict. \n \n(Additional reporting by Gulsen Solaker in Ankara; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Mark Trevelyan) \n \neuronews provides breaking news articles from Reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.", "source": "EuroNews"}
