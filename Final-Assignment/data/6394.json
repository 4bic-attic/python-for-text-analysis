On August 2nd, Seabrooke crossed a 210-foot gap between two cliffs in British Columbia nearly a thousand feet above the ground - with no safety aids whatsoever. \n \nVideographer Zachary Moxley used a drone to shoot the entire event in all its gut-wrenching glory. On several instances, Seabrooke falls, catches himself, and calmly resumes his endeavor. No biggie for a guy who dives between canyons for kicks , but my stomach was in knots the entire time. \n \n [embedded content] \n \n[ Vancouver Sun ]", "source": "Gizmodo India"}
