Yet the bill\u2019s language is stacked against the patient and applies to people with years, even decades, to live.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe bill applies to people with a \u2018terminal disease,\u2019 which is defined as having less than six months to live. Most people thinks this means \u2018dying,\u2019\u201d Dore said. \"However, in Oregon, which uses a nearly-identical definition of terminal disease, an 18-year-old with insulin-dependent diabetes is \u2018eligible\u2019 for assisted suicide. Doctors are often wrong at predicting life expectancy. Sadly, this bill encourages people with years, even decades, to live to throw away their lives.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIn my law practice, I started out working in guardianships, wills and probate, and saw abuse of all kinds, especially where there was money involved (where there's a will, there are heirs),\u201d Dore explained. \u201cThe California bill sets up the perfect crime: your heir can actively participate in signing you up for the lethal dose and once the lethal dose is in the home, there\u2019s no oversight --not even a witness is required. If you resisted or struggled, who would know?\"\n\u201cThe Assembly got caught up in the concept of the bill, when the devil was in the details of the bill text,\u201d Dore said. \u201cHopefully, when it goes to the Senate, there will be a closer examination of the text and the raft of problems in the bill.\"\u00a0 Governor Brown should ready his veto pen for this deceptive legislation.
