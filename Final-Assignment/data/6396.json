EMPLOYMENT Minister Eric Abetz will represent Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at an event this weekend, showing he has no intention of giving up his cabinet position. Senator Abetz has returned to Tasmania after a tumultuous week in Canberra that saw Mr Turnbull beat former Liberal leader Tony Abbott in a leadership spill.\n\nIt has been widely suggested by commentators that Senator Abetz could be dumped from cabinet on Monday when Mr Turnbull announces his new ministers.\n\nDespite backing Mr Abbott, he will represent Mr Turnbull at the Battle of Britain commemorative events in Hobart over the weekend.\n\nSenator Abetz has not yet met Mr Turnbull to discuss his future.\n\nHe told the Senate on Thursday he was \"taking it one day at a time\" and would continue his work as employment minister until an announcement was made.\n\nSenator Abetz publicly supported Mr Abbott, and said leadership changes did not win elections.\n\nIn a business as usual move, Senator Abetz has been sending out press releases spruiking the government's work in job creation and made conservative appointments to the Fair Work Commission.\n\nTasmanian Liberal Senator Richard Colbeck has been touted as a possible minister in the new cabinet.\n\nSenator Colbeck was the only Tasmanian Liberal MP to not publicly support Mr Abbott, but has not commented.", "source": "Tasmanian Examiner"}
