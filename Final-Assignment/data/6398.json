It\u2019s a crisis entirely of the government\u2019s making. Cambridge University Hospitals Trust is the 15th NHS trust to be put into special measures\u200e, but through no fault of the staff. They are running themselves into the ground, yet still striving to provide good quality care, against all the odds. \n \n\u201cOur NHS can\u2019t survive much more papering over the cracks like this. The government needs to get a grip and resource the NHS properly in the face of ever growing demands upon its services.\u201d \n \nThe article first appeared on the UNISON site.", "source": "UNISON.org"}
