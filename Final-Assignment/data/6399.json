Dutch Ruppersberger off the list of potential Senate candidates in Maryland. \n \nOn  Tuesday, the Democrat from Timonium announced that he will run for  re-election to his 2nd District House seat rather than seek the  Democratic nomination for Senate in 2016. The veteran congressman \u2014 who  represents parts of Baltimore City, as well as portions of Anne Arundel,  Howard, Harford and Baltimore Counties \u2014 will be running for his eighth  term. \n \nAfter  pondering a Senate bid, Ruppersberger said in a statement that he had  decided it would be best to serve in the House to continue focusing on  veterans and seniors issues, as well as legislation to create jobs. He  added that it was important to have \u201ca strong Maryland presence\u201d on the  House Appropriations Committee to ensure that adequate federal money  gets to his home state. \n \n\u201cWashington  needs more legislators who put common sense before politics,\u201d Ruppersberger said in his statement. \u201cThis is especially true as we  prepare to confront critical decisions on our nation\u2019s economy, the  future of Social Security and Medicare and our desperate need to improve  the nation\u2019s infrastructure as well as create jobs.\u201d \n \nAnother  Baltimore-area Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Elijah Cummings, is  considering a Senate bid. However, he has not yet made an official  announcement. \n \nMaryland  lawmakers who are officially running for Democratic Sen. Barbara  Mikulski\u2019s seat are Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Fort Washington, and Rep.  Chris Van Hollen, D-Kensington. \n \n Mikulski , who has held her seat as senator since 1987, announced in March that she would not seek reelection.", "source": "Citybizlist"}
