In a statement on Saturday he said that, \u201cIt\u2019s clear President Obama is more interested in appeasing America\u2019s homosexuals than honouring America\u2019s heroes.\u201d \n \nHe argued that, \u201cObama is so obsessed with pandering to liberal interest groups he\u2019s nominated an openly gay civilian to run the Army.\u201d \n \nHuckabee added that \u201cHomosexuality is not a job qualification\u201d and that the military should not be used to conduct \u201csocial experiments.\u201d \n \nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC) lashed out at Huckabee and pointed out that Fanning has more than twenty years of national security experience, including oversight of some of the Pentagon\u2019s largest shipbuilding and fighter systems. \n \n\u201cMike Huckabee is so blinded by his own bigotry that he would oppose someone with two decades of national security experience just because of his sexual orientation,\u201d said JoDee Winterhof, HRC Senior Vice President of Policy and Political Affairs. \n \n\u201cMike Huckabee\u2019s naked prejudice and willingness to smear an experienced public servant shows he is unfit to be commander in chief. Other candidates should make immediately clear they won\u2019t tolerate Huckabee\u2019s bigotry and that they will make these decisions based on Eric Fanning\u2019s experience and on the merits.\u201d \n \nHuckabee\u00a0 recently attended \u00a0the release rally of anti-gay Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, a law-breaking public servant who has defied her bosses and the courts. He described her as a hero. \n \nThe HRC urged the Senate to quickly confirm Fanning\u2019s nomination as Secretary of the US Army. \n \nAlso on Friday, Amanda Simpson was sworn in as the Executive Director of the US Army Office of Energy Initiatives. She became the highest ranking openly transgender official in the Obama Administration.", "source": "Mambaonline"}
