This will be an open event but the duration of how long the beta lasts remains to be seen. \u00a0The main mode that will be featured is Walker Assault on Hoth, which supports up to 40 players. Both Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker will be available characters, though you will have to earn them. Any progression made in the beta will not be transferred to the full game. \n \nThere will be a co-op mission on hand too in the form of a survival mission on Tatooine. In this you and another player must fight off waves of Imperial forces to be successful. Another mode called Drop Zone has also been announced for the beta, but details on that won\u2019t be available until next week. Furthermore a companion app for Battlefront has also been announced, and here you will be able to adjust load outs, play card game Base Command, and earn credits to use in the main game. This app will be available on both iOS and Android before the release of Star Wars Battlefront. \n \nSource: EA", "source": "TheSixthAxis"}
