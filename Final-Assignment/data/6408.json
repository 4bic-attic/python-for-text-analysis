I couldn't help myself. \n\nAnyway, Chris Brown may have to skip a scheduled Australian tour in December, as officials from the country apparently have a problem with guys convicted of beating up Rihanna. \n\nTMZ quotes an immigration official saying, \"People need to understand if you are going to commit domestic violence and then you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, 'You cannot come in because you are not of the character we expect in Australia.'\" \n\nIn this July 25, 2015 file photo, Chris Brown performs at a club in Macau.

Chris Brown isn't even welcome in a country full of people descended from prisoners. \n\nAustralia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, reportedly agreed with the immigration statement, saying it was \"brilliantly expressed.\" \n\nBrown's tour is scheduled to hit Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
