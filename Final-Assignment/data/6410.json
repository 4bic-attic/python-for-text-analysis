Obviously signing the contract makes it all real but I'm still fighting for a spot on the final roster,\" Webster told TAB Trackside Radio.\n\n\"I'm still realistic about this but today was a great day and signing the contract just makes it a little more real.\n\n\"It's an unguaranteed contract right now. I'm on the roster for the training camp. There's a possibility I don't make the final roster. If they keep me, things on the contract change. I will just keep on working hard.\n\n\"I've still got a lot to prove and I'm quick to realise what the goal is and the work there I still have to do. You have dreams and you have to keep pursuing them.\" \n\nReality is I haven't done anything yet. Still fighting for a spot on the final roster, a lot more work to be done!\u2014 Corey Webster (@cwebster9) September 22, 2015\n\nThe training camp will be in Virginia.\n\n\"I have to play better than the guys that I'm going up against. I have to prove to the coaches and players that are here that I can play at this level consistently and prove to them that it wouldn't;' be too much of a risk to put me on the roster.\"\n\nWebster said if the Pelicans didn't want him, history showed that other players in similar situations had been picked up by other franchises.\n\nOtherwise he was likely to return to play for the New Zealand Breakers in the NBL.\n\nNew Zealand already has Steve Adams set to play his third season in the NBA with the Oklahoma City Thunder.
