While some treatments\u00a0feature the neuropeptide argireline, this peptide has resulted in mixed results at best, with some persons getting significant results, and others\u2026well, not so much.\nEnter\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate. A new, exclusive, patented neuropeptide complex,\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0includes not one, not two, but\u00a0four \u00a0neuropeptides\u00a0that are capable of producing results comparable to injections\u00a0without\u00a0the \u201cfrozen face\u201d.\u00a0In a\u00a014-day trial, ERASA XEP-30 performed with amazing results across multiple measures. Independent testing reported, on average, a measurable 64% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, with the top quartile seeing more than 90% reduction.\nIt should be noted that\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0is the brainchild of Chief Scientist Jules Zecchino, who was the former Head of Skin Care R&D at Est\u00e9e Lauder for over 20 years, and responsible for the development of the company\u2019s top performing products in their multi-billion dollar segments. His team at BioMimetic Laboratories aims to build upon their impressive achievements by utilizing internal technologies as well as leveraging relationships with a number of scientific, corporate and academic affiliates who provide the adjunct technology and manufacturing necessary for product commercialization.\nERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0targets\u00a0erasing appearance deep frown and expression lines with the following ingredients:XEP-30 Results in Line-Relaxing Effects\nA new, patented neuropeptide that is exclusive to\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate. Though much of the early research is private, ERASA affirms on its\u00a0website\u00a0that XEP-30 has \u201cthe most line-relaxing effects to date [of any topically-applied peptide]\u201d.\nLet\u2019s talk about the differences between XEP-30 and Botox\u00ae. XEP-30 is a purified biomimetic version of a neurotoxin\u00a0that is derived from a specific cone snail off the coast of Australia; Botox\u00ae, on the other hand, is a purified\u00a0neurotoxin\u00a0derived from the bacteria\u00a0Clostridium botulinum. Though some internet reports express concern at using toxins in the skin, according to dermatologist\u00a0Dr. Jessica Krant, M.D., \u201cBecause it is the piece of protein used in Botox\u00ae, and not the bacteria\u00a0itself, it can\u2019t generate more toxin in your body and make you sick.\u201d The same logic may be the case of XEP-30; no living organisms are applied to your\u00a0skin, only the purified protein.\nThe function is also similar. Once injected, Botox\u00ae works by weakening facial muscles that frequently contract during smiling or frowning by attaching itself to the junction between nerve and muscle. By blocking muscle activation, creases are not permitted to form on your face, which allows your existing lines to slowly fade or disappear completely. Similarly, once topically applied to the skin, XEP-30 is a biomimetic, inhibiting some degree of facial\u00a0muscle activation. In this way, creases do not form\u00a0on your face, and existing lines will, over time, fade away.\nThe benefit of a topically-applied biomimetic like XEP-30 over\u00a0Botox\u00ae is that XEP-30 will not create an overdone, or \u201cfrozen,\u201d\u00a0appearance. While\u00a0Botox\u00ae can expertly be injected at certain angles and specific spots of the skin to keep muscle movement looking natural, some who administer Botox\u00ae do not have this level of precision. Using a treatment like\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0may improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, without the risk of looking stiff, unnatural, or \u201cfrozen.\u201dX-50 Myocept Has a State-of-the-Art Delivery System to Deliver Actives\nTwo more neuropeptides are contained in X-50 Myocept (Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-52 & Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-18) which acts similarly to XEP-30, in that it is designed to relax muscles and prevent contraction. What makes X-50 Myocept stand apart is its targeted delivery system, which directs wrinkle-relaxing actives to the skin cells that will benefit from them the most.\nDeveloped by\u00a0Infinitec, X50 has a\u00a0downright\u00a0tiny\u00a0size, X50\u00a0has a\u00a0size distribution between 180 to 400 nm, so it allows X50 to be taken up by the cells, and to release the actives into the cytosol of the cells.\nTo lead X50 to cell target, a portion of a peptide is anchored to the outer layer of X50. It will eventually lead the capsule to a specific receptor on the target skin cell. Interestingly enough, the peptide-capsule avoids non-specific clearance by other cells rather than specific targets by having a water-loving (hydrophilic) side chain that gives it \u201cstealth\u201d maneuvering powers.\nWhile this technology could theoretically be used to deliver any number of actives into the cytosol of skin cells, X-50 Myocept uses this\u00a0efficient delivery process to direct neuropeptide into the core of the target skin cell.\nIn this way,\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0may improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by delivering key ingredients to targeted locations within the skin cell. Brilliant, really!Argireline gently relaxes wrinkles\nLike at a crowded cocktail party, you may be relieved to find a reliable friend in Argireline.\u00a0A\u00a0rather popular peptide complex, Argireline works in two ways, according to the\u00a0Textbook of Aging Skin:Stops formation of a complex necessary for neurotransmitter release, called the SNARE complex.Inhibits the release of neurotransmitters, including catecholamines, noradrenaline, and adrenaline.\nAt 5% concentration, Argireline has been shown to decrease wrinkles up to 30% when applied once daily for 28 days\u00a0(International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 2002). Argireline at 10% has also been shown to have better wrinkle-fighting effects than another peptide,\u00a0Leuphasyl, at 10% (International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 2009).\nIn essence, the argireline in\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0has been proven to relax wrinkles gently.\nOther Exciting Ingredients: Niacinamide, Galabridin, Boswellia, and MoreNiacinamide \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0potent form of Vitamin B3 that has been proven in independent, peer-reviewed scientific studies to\u00a0improve skin\u2019s barrier (protective) function,\u00a0treat mild to moderate acne,\u00a0prevent glycation,\u00a0aid fine lines and wrinkles,and\u00a0treat age spots and other signs of hyperpigmentation97% Pure Galabridin \u2013 the active concentrate\u00a0found in Licorice root extract, Galabridin brightens skin while it reduces inflammation\u2014a key cause of aging skin.Magnolia, Boswellia, and White Birch \u2014\u00a0this combination is scientifically-proven to\u00a0decrease\u00a0skin inflammation.Proprietary Polymers and Microspheres \u2013\u00a0instantly smooth skin and refine texture.How to Use ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\nApply twice a day, morning and night on clean skin and follow with moisturizer.\u00a0Pump a small amount (2 to 3 pumps) onto your fingertips, blending a thin layer over the entire face and under eye area. Wait a few seconds before applying additional products. In the morning, if desired, follow with your daytime antioxidant serum, moisturizer, primer, and/or foundation. Before bed, repeat application followed by night serum and/or moisturizer. This product may be applied to the neck and d\u00e9colletage.\nI often receive questions about how various products can best be combined in a skin care regimen to optimize the performance of each product. In this instance,\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0was\u00a0designed to be used on clean, bare skin. Cleanse, then apply this product\u00a0first.\u00a0Then\u00a0remember the general rule of thumb: Apply all skin care products light to heavy, so as to let the lighter ingredients absorb into the skin first, always applying sunscreens last.\nSo in the instance that you wish to apply products that are lighter than\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate, still apply\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate, and\u00a0then apply your next round of serums, creams, and sunscreens from lightest to heaviest. On the other hand, in the instance that you wish to apply products that are heavier than\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate, proceed as per usual, from next-lightest to heaviest, always applying sunscreens last.How Long Does it Take to See Results?\nImmediately, smoothing, evening, and softening of the skin\u2019s texture and appearance will occur, leading to protected luminous, rejuvenated younger looking skin. Within two weeks, you will see frown lines and wrinkles significantly improved. Age spots, uneven skin color and even dark under-eye circles will be diminished. With each use, ERASA will help to correct and repair loss of elasticity and dullness. Within four to six weeks, you will see dramatic improvement in frown lines, wrinkles, dark undereye circles, and age spots.Is it Safe?\nDermatology patients are often concerned that long-term use neurotoxins like Botox\u00ae can cause their skin to \u201cwear out\u201d from the gradual\u00a0freezing and unfreezing cycles\u00a0from injections to\u00a0complete disinhibition. However, the skin does not, in fact, wear out at all from the use of freeze peptides or neurotoxins.\u00a0Histological analysis shows absolutely no difference in the elasticity or integrity of tissues before and after long-term\u00a0Botox\u00ae\u00a0treatment (European Journal of Neurology, 2006).\nSince argireline works on the same pathways as Botox\u00ae, and to a much lesser extent (topically applied rather than injected), it should not exhibit permanent sagging effects, even if it is applied all over the face.\u00a0Unlike Botox\u00ae, the effects are also consistently reinstated with twice-daily use of\u00a0ERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate.Bottom Line\nERASA combines an exclusive new neuropeptide technology, XEP-30, with four other powerful neuropeptides, creating a formidable quad-peptide complex in the fight of anti-aging. This patent-pending complex is delivered with a\u00a0patent-pending delivery system, X50 Myocept, along with other well proven anti-inflammatories and collagen boosters.\nThese ingredients are designed to work gently beneath the surface of the skin day by day, helping to relax muscle contractions and smoothing lines and wrinkles. With continued use over 2-4 weeks, wrinkles and lines will start to be smoothed and filled without blocking movement or causing the \u201cfrozen face\u201d\u00a0of injectables.\nERASA XEP-30 Extreme Line Lifting and Rejuvenation Concentrate\u00a0is an exciting product for me as a science-driven beauty blogger because\u00a0it\u00a0is an entirely new, luxurious concentrate that introduces the patented neuropeptide XEP-30 and the cogent new delivery system X50 Myocept for the very first time to the cosmetics market.\u00a0I\u2019m excited about the potential of this product to help\u00a0appearance of wrinkles \u2014 including deep frown and expression lines, dark undereye circles, and age spots \u00a0\u2014 and I\u2019m thrilled to be one of the first to introduce it to my readers!\nINGREDIENTS:\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polysilicone-11, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Polyethylene, Dimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Amodimethicone, Steareth-21, Mica, Creatine, Niacinamide, Whey Protein, Polysorbate 20, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl\u00a0 Methylcellulose, Mu-Conotoxin Cniiic, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8,\u00a0 Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-52, Pamitoyl Heptapeptide-18, Algae Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, , Glabridin, Sucrose,\u00a0 Glycine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Albizia Julibrissin Bark Extract, Caffeine, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, N-Acetyl -D-Glucosamine, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Oleic Acid, , Laureth-12, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, VP/VA Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Darutoside, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Dimethylacrylamide/Acrylic Acid/Polystyrene Ethyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Carbomer, Dextran, Polysorbate 80,\u00a0 Potassium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol,\u00a0 Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Red No. 4, CI 77891\nRelated", "source": "FutureDerm"}
