CUB spokeswoman Jennifer Howard said two hour-long stoppages have already been held by warehouse workers and both had no impact on beer supply. \"There's plenty of beer for the grand final,\" Ms Howard told AAP. She said CUB would monitor the stoppages and impact on beer supplies over the coming weeks and if needed it would use their brewing and logistics network to pick up any shortfall. \"Clearly our preference is to keep the parties talking and support our customers and consumers through peak times,\" she said. The Abbotsford plant produces Carlton Draught, VB and Crown Lager beers. The opposition says Victoria's rise in industrial action was concerning. \"We've got train strikes, tram strikes, cab strikes, beer strikes, we are becoming Victoria the state of strikes,\" Liberal leader Matthew Guy said. \"In just nine months of Labor government we've descended from a stable place to live, work and invest into probably the most chaotic in Australia.\" Comment has been sought from unions for the brewery workers, United Voice and the CFMEU.", "source": "Tasmania Mercury"}
