You\u2019re not going to listen to me anyway, are you? You\u2019re going to listen to your pleading, tearful 6-year old who definitely wants that puppy and has already named her Sparkles. Fine, go ahead. But you\u2019ve been warned. \n \nYou\u2019re going to open up your wallet for Sparkles. You\u2019re going to buy her a beautiful doggy bed, stock the cabinets with healthy, environmentally-friendly, organic and insanely overpriced dog food and invest in the best collar and leash money can buy -- because nothing\u2019s too good for Sparkles. You\u2019re going to take Sparkles to the vet and shell out hundreds for examinations, shots and neutering.\u00a0You will get yelled at by a customer for falling asleep at a sales meeting because you stayed up all night listening to Sparkles bark or chase imaginary (you hope) friends around the house. \n \nOh, of course it's\u00a0worth it. Sparkles is a bundle of love! But, oh boy, did it cost you. \n \nRelated:\u00a0 How Much Cash Do You Need for Your Business's Safety Net? \n \nNo, Sparkles was not free. Nothing is free. Everything costs more than people say. Your job, as a business owner, is to make sure you\u2019re fully aware of all the costs before you buy in. \n \nFor example, software has a hidden cost. When you move to that great, cloud-based system to do your accounting,\u00a0payroll or sales tracking, you\u2019re not just paying that \u201clow monthly fee\u201d for the service. \n \nWho\u2019s going to migrate the data from your existing system? Who\u2019s going to get everything set up in the new system? Who\u2019s going to make sure you\u2019re getting the same reports you were getting before? Who\u2019s going to teach everyone how to use the new system and be available to answer all the inevitable questions? \n \nSomeone will need to do all of this. Maybe that someone is an employee of yours or maybe it\u2019s someone you\u2019ll hire from the outside,\u00a0or maybe a combination of the two. But the reality is that it will take time and time is money. \n \nRelated:\u00a0 8 Ways to Make Certain Optimism Doesn't Blind You to Signs You're Going Broke \n \nWhen you bring in an outside consultant, lawyer, accountant or project manager have you really considered the costs? No, it\u2019s not just their hourly fee. It\u2019s the time you\u2019re going to have to take to work with that person. No professional can do their work in a vacuum. To really succeed with a project you\u2019re going to have to be fully engaged with your consultant. You can\u2019t just hand the ball over and expect him or her to run down the field. You can\u2019t absolve yourself of any responsibility. \n \nOutsiders need supervision, guidance and input from you if they\u2019re going to help you accomplish the goals you\u2019ve given them. Don\u2019t expect to just wipe your hands clean. And don\u2019t expect it to just cost you an hourly fee. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that. \n \nWhen you hire that new customer-service rep, have you considered all the costs? It\u2019s not just salary. It\u2019s health insurance, social security,\u00a0Medicare and unemployment insurance. It\u2019s sick time and vacation days and 401(k)\u00a0contributions. \n \nIt\u2019s the weeks your new hire will\u00a0need to get up to speed, which means someone internally will need to provide training, fixing mistakes and dealing with customers during the transition. It\u2019s the time you\u2019ll need to check in on progress, sit in on evaluations and approve that promised salary increase six or 12 months later. No, a person\u2019s salary is not the only cost. Even a \u201cfree\u201d summer intern requires time to supervise. There are other costs you have to consider. \n \nDo you consider all of these costs when you\u2019re about to invest? It\u2019s always more than people say, so build in your cushions and increase your budget. And though you may not wind up with a lovable, devoted puppy as your reward, you can at least make sure you\u2019re not paying more for something than you intended. \n \nRelated:\u00a0 8 Expenses Businesses Should Pass on to Customers \n \nSource: Entrepreneur \n \nThe post Things Always Cost More Than You Think appeared first on The Dessauer Group .", "source": "The Dessauer Group"}
