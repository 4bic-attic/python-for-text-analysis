That's how I came to find this gorgeous jar candle from Next. I was waiting for my husband and wasted no time doing a little browse through the shops when I fell victim to the sweet scent of Apricot Blossom. I can't say enough about this candle\u2026 The label is so cute, the ribbon adds the perfect little touch and as I said before, it smells like heaven. What more could you want for just a fiver?\nUnfortunately I'm not able to find this candle online, but I found it in-store at Next just about a week ago. You can however grab the same scent online in the diffusers, which come in two different sizes.", "source": "Pink Julep"}
