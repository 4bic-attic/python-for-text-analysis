Boehner\u2019s five-year tenure. This latest showdown, like its recent predecessors, is another example that brinksmanship \u2014 involving countdown clocks and advisories to federal workers about the possible expiration of funding on Sept. 30 \u2014 is the new normal. \n\nBoehner (R-Ohio) said Wednesday that there was \u201cwidespread support\u201d among House Republicans to approve a stopgap bill well into the fall to allow for more time to negotiate final budget numbers with President Obama. But, he acknowledged, GOP leaders have not decided how to handle the large demand for language in the funding plan that would strip Planned Parenthood of the small amount of federal funds it receives each year following the release of undercover videos alleging some agents of the group sell body parts of aborted fetuses. \n\n\u201cI have not made any decisions,\u201d Boehner told reporters after a regular closed-door meeting of the Republican caucus. \u201cNo decisions at this point.\u201d \n\nThe speaker\u2019s closest ally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has already signaled that there is no chance of getting a funding bill through with limitations on the female health service provider because Senate Democrats have enough votes to filibuster such a bill and Republicans have nowhere near enough votes to reach a two-thirds majority to override a likely veto from Obama. \n\nThose dynamics have left GOP leaders privately trying to pursue a path that would focus the campaign against Planned Parenthood on committee hearings and investigations, while keeping the government funded without another shutdown. McConnell has regularly cautioned against another government shutdown, saying that there is \u201cno education in the second kick of a mule.\u201d His reference is to the 16-day shutdown in 2013 that was politically disastrous for the Republicans. \n\nThe situation is complicated, however, by Boehner\u2019s enemies, an emboldened conservative bloc which now boasts the signature of 31 Republicans on a letter pledging to oppose any spending measure that continues federal funding for Planned Parenthood. \n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) suggested that congressional GOP leaders were not willing to fight hard enough. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re setting up for surrender,\u201d Mulvaney said Wednesday at a gathering of House conservatives. \u201cLeadership is going to have to choose: Do they want it to be a talking point, or do they want to actually do something about it?\u201d \n\nThis clutch of far-right conservatives, under the recently formed banner of the \u201cFreedom Caucus,\u201d has adopted the language of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who regularly accuses McConnell of liberal misdeeds and often asserts that McConnell\u2019s leadership is no different from his Democratic predecessor, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). \n\n\u201cUntil Mitch wakes up and realizes that he\u2019s no different than Harry Reid right now, it\u2019s going to be a real rugged couple of months,\u201d Mulvaney said. \n\nWith up to three dozen Republicans balking, Boehner must go to Democrats in order to avoid a federal shutdown, a circumstance that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is well aware of and is hoping to exploit to Democrats\u2019 advantage. \n\nPelosi told reporters Wednesday that her demand in exchange for keeping the government open is to have a public commencement of \u201cgood faith\u201d negotiations that would lead to a bipartisan deal loosening restraints on federal spending under the 2011 Budget Control Act, commonly referred to as \u201csequestration.\u201d \n\nDemocrats are seeking an additional even split in increased funds for domestic agencies and the Pentagon. \n\n\u201cWe want to see some progress but, again, let\u2019s come to the table and say what is our goal, what is our timetable and what are our milestones,\u201d Pelosi said. \n\nRepublicans have pushed for greater national security spending but without any additional spending for domestic programs favored by Democrats. Some Republicans have even sought deeper cuts in domestic spending to offset the larger amount of defense funds. \n\nEngaging in talks with Pelosi and Obama risks losing more support from Republicans who consider themselves fiscal hawks, and the greater number of Republicans who defect against Boehner on government funding, the weaker his already tenuous hold on the speaker\u2019s gavel appears to be. \n\nAll this comes as some conservatives are threatening to force a vote of no confidence in Boehner\u2019s speakership \u2014 Mulvaney describes the potential no-confidence vote as a \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over Boehner\u2019s head throughout a series of fiscal showdowns this fall. \n\nPelosi said that Boehner\u2019s only path to avoiding a shutdown was through her caucus rather than the conservatives, who want big showdowns that result in bad political outcomes for their own leadership and for the White House. \n\n\u201cAnti-governance, anti-science and anti-President Obama,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThey have a trifecta, three comfort levels at which they will shut down the government and be very happy about it.\u201d \n\n Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post"}
