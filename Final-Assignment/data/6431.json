The David Carr Fellow will spend two years in the Times\u2019 newsroom covering\u00a0technology, media and culture. Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, said that the Times will be looking at candidates who share Carr\u2019s passion for telling stories and \u201cPeople who maybe have an unusual background. David Carr was a recovering drug addict who came to us from the alternative news media world. That\u2019s very unusual for The New York Times.\u201d Baquet added that the fellowship gave the Times \u201ca more permanent, lasting way to honor David.\u201d The deadline for applications (apply here) is November 16. The fellowship will begin early next year.", "source": "FishbowlNY Feed"}
