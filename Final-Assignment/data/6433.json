Huawei participated in the Forum and demonstrated its National Broadband and Smart City solutions promoting gigaband development. \nIn a keynote speech entitled, \"NBN2020: Gigaband Nation Boosts Innovations and Prosperity,\" Tang Xinbing, CTO of Huawei's Fixed Network Product Line stressed the significance of ultra-broadband infrastructure on industrial and social development. \"NBN2020 will better connect consumers and enterprises, and build a solid foundation network for Industry 4.0, accelerating economic and social development,\" Tang said. \n   Huawei introduced Gigaband from three aspects. In terms of bandwidth, Huawei is researching and innovating access technologies for upgrading broadband from 100M to 1000M, building the foundation for the ROADS experience. As to coverage, Gigaband networks will cover over 90 percent of households by 2020, making the ubiquitous ROADS experience possible. As to experience, Huawei has adopted the U-vMOS system to quantize video experience indicators and form a unified video experience standard, to assess and measure the quality of operator networks using the high-quality video experience benchmark, and making the ROADS experience measurable. Gigaband both improves access speed and network coverage, enhancing subscriber experience. \nImplementing the Gigaband strategy requires the joint efforts of UBB industry players and governments. Industry policies must change from encouraging competition to promoting investment, and opening municipal infrastructure to operators, to help them reduce fiber to the home costs and deployment difficulties. For example, in China , optical fiber is pre-buried for new buildings (Fiber-To-The-Home) to facilitate FTTH. Operators also need to formulate network development strategies to support a gradual evolution and build data-center based simple and agile ultra-broadband networks. Operators should increase investment in innovative Gigaband applications to realize the value of Gigaband networks and form a healthy UBB industry circle. \nAfter Huawei's presentation, \n, Director of the Department of International Cooperation and International Organizations in the R&D Division of Higher Education, Science and Research at Slovakia's Ministry of Education, said: \"Huawei is the world's leading ICT company and we appreciated the professional presentations, especially proposing the target of Gigaband Nation, which provided a profound vision and valuable information. \"\u00a0 \n, Ambassador-at-Large, Science and Innovation of Slovakia's Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, said: \"Huawei is a responsible company in local society and plays a\u00a0significant role in ICT and innovative development. We expect further cooperation in the future.\" \nAfter 10 years of partnering with Slovakia , Huawei is now Slovakia's major telecommunications solutions provider and has the No.1 market share in broadband access networks and management services. At present, Huawei has 70 employees working in Slovakia .
