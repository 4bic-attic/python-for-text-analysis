Knowing all FA patients will eventually require bone marrow transplants, more than 500 Chiefs have joined the Be The Match national registry in hopes of one day becoming a bone marrow donor. \n\nThe three Chiefs miraculously identified as a match include Breanna Amborn \n\n\"As we race to find a cure for Fanconi anemia, I express my endless thanks to these three brave individuals and all who contribute to our effort in any way,\" Fisher said. \n\nNearly 100 percent of FA patients need high-risk bone marrow transplants before adulthood, and even then, survivors have an average life expectancy of only 29 years old. Kidz1stFund continues to host bone marrow drives on a weekly basis and collect donations to fund research at the University of Minnesota \n\nTo make a contribution, become a donor or learn more about the fight against Fanconi anemia, visit www.Kidz1stFund.com.\n\nAdditional media materials including fact sheets, interviews, b-roll and other visual assets may be obtained by contacting Kidz1stFund@zimmerman.com. \n\nContact Information: \n\nThe Zimmerman Agency \n\nKidz1stFund@zimmerman.com \n\n850-668-2222\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150912/265956 Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150912/265955 \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fsu-marching-chiefs-honors-coach-fishers-fight-300141959.html\n\n\u00a92015 PR Newswire.
