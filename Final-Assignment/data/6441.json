But his son was having none of it. The little boy finally\u00a0reluctantly agreed on the new bed, but only if he received \u201cthe most awesome bed ever.\u201d Sounds reasonable enough to us.

So Strong took all of his son\u2019s interests (playgrounds, simple machines, rolling ball sculptures and the Berenstain Bears book \u201cThe Spooky Old Tree\u201d) and created what we\u2019re certain his son would call \u201cthe most awesome bed ever.\u201d \n   Previous page  1  2 Continue reading     Jill Layton  \nJill lives in Long Beach, California and thinks it's weird that riding stationary bikes in a dark room is a thing, but frequently does it anyway.
