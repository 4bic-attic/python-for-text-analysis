By delivering direct response marketing campaigns with fully closed-loop creative attribution, this data feedback creates campaigns, messages and marketing channel mixes that get better over time to maximize an institution's ROI. \n\n\"We chose Helix Education as our integrated agency of record because of its top talent, exclusive higher education expertise, and fresh creative concepts with unparalleled production value--capabilities that are too sophisticated for us to try and replicate in-house at the institutional level,\" said David Rose, Vice President of Enrollment at Indiana Wesleyan University. \"Helix understands the higher education landscape on a national level, believes in the mission of our institution, and has the skill set needed to assess campaign analytics and integrated channels to maximize our ROI.\" \n   \nA recent Gallup briefing found that many higher education brands are all too similar to each other. The article states, \"By strategically rethinking the three components of the institution's identity -- purpose, brand and culture -- with the intention of establishing unique and outcome-focused values, leaders can create clear and compelling statements that distinguish their institution from all others.\" Helix Education's team helps colleges and universities do just that, relying on data to truly understand each institution's exact target market and shape the campaigns that not only resonate, but importantly, differentiate its brand in meaningful and relevant ways. \n\nUnlike other models that often result in inconsistent branding, cost inefficiencies and siloed data across a variety of one-off media vendors, Helix Education's integrated AOR model maximizes enrollment growth with data insights that steer and adapt campaigns and placements to optimize results while minimizing spend. Additionally, Helix Education believes in a no-commodity creative approach. For more than 40 years, it has been utilizing extensive research to understand each institution's unique audience and crafting messages and artwork specific to engage and compel prospective students to enroll. \n\n\"At Helix Education, we understand that strategic enrollment marketing continues to become more competitive and complex,\" said Matthew Schnittman , President and CEO of Helix Education. \"By leveraging data to drive our integrated marketing campaigns, we know we are crafting the right messages, reaching the right audiences, and making the right campaign optimizations to ensure our partners' enrollment and program targets are met. Our best-in-class creative and technology coupled with our data-driven insights give our partners the ability to not only take their advertising and marketing campaigns to the next level, but to do so in a way that helps build brand awareness and distinguishes their institution from others.\" \n\nAbout Helix Education \nEducators today are challenged to achieve multi-layer visibility, actionable analytics and measurable results, yet the legacy partnership approach that spans the industry simply can't support these outcomes.
