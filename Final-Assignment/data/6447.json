But after considering the alternatives, I will support this agreement.\u201d \n\nThe 34-senator milestone represents a resounding defeat for efforts by the Republicans and the Israeli government to derail the agreement, but it is by no means the end of the political struggle. The threshold means that Obama\u2019s supporters could stop his veto being overridden if he needed to use it against a congressional vote of disapproval on the JCPOA, agreed with Iran, the US and five other world powers in July. Democrats are now trying to reach 41 votes, enough to block the disapproval vote in the Senate by filibuster, and spare Obama from having to spend political capital on a veto.\n\nThe result is already a stinging blow for the deal\u2019s principal opponents, the Republican leadership, the American Israel Political Affairs Committee lobby group \u2013 which spent tens of millions of dollars campaigning against the JCPOA \u2013 and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who waded into US politics to an extraordinary degree in an attempt to block it.\n\nDiplomats say Wednesday\u2019s milestone removes the more significant near-term threat to the survival of the agreement, which has already been endorsed by a Security Council vote. It is likely to accelerate preparatory steps on all sides to implement the deal, particularly in Iran, which has a long list of tasks to carry out under the JCPOA to limit the capacity of its nuclear programme before it can benefit from sanctions relief. \n\nThe spectacle of the furious US political battle has also helped convince some sceptics in the Iranian leadership over the Obama administration\u2019s determination to honour its side of the deal. Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group backing diplomacy with Tehran, said: \u201cWith the deal now being confirmed, there is a stronger expectation now that [Supreme Leader] Khamenei will come out and endorse it.\u201d\n\nSecuring the deal in Washington has shifted attention to Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani argued that the JCPOA does not need approval from Iran\u2019s parliament, the Majlis. The deal has been submitted for review, but ultimately nobody expects the Majlis to defy the Supreme Leader to such a crucial issue. \n\n\u201cEven the most ardent anti-American politicians in Tehran now realize that the US is no longer monolithically hostile towards Iran. What is less certain in their eyes is whether this amounts to a strategic shift or a ephemeral phenomenon that ends with Obama\u2019s presidency,\u201d Ali Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group said. \n\nThe real struggle in Iranian politics will be over whether the JCPOA will lead to a more general thaw in relations with the US. It has been a battle fought out in the past few days on the wall of the former US embassy, where the \u201cDeath to America\u201d slogans that have been there since the 1979 Islamic revolution were painted over this week, only to be replaced by a plaque engraved with anti-American slogans put up by ultra-conservative students.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An Iranian woman walks next to an anti-US moral on her way to the former US embassy in Tehran on Wednesday. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA Conservative elements in the regime have been kept at bay by the Rouhani government, bolstered by the Obama administration\u2019s success to date in keeping American hardliners in check. But that balance is precarious, as opponents of the JCPOA plan new unilateral sanctions aimed at sabotaging the agreement.\n\n\u201cMost worrying is that lobbyists have already begun circulating drafts for new legislation that would impose new waves of sanctions against Iran unilaterally without due regard for the conflict resolution process entailed under the deal,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh, of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \n\n\u201cIf such proposals become law in the course of the next few months when Iran begins to implement its commitments under the deal, Congress would in effect kill agreement. Imposing US unilateral nuclear related sanctions would force Iran to walk away from the deal, China and Russia are likely to do the same \u2013 and Europeans would be placed in a dilemma scenario.\u201d\n\nThe text on sanctions in the JCPOA explicitly notes: \u201cIran has stated that it will treat \u2026 such an imposition of new nuclear-related sanctions, as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.\u201d\n\nTherefore, new congressional sanctions, nuclear-related or otherwise, could still sink the agreement, and the president could have to his veto repeatedly to protect it, in turn raising concerns in Tehran and among US allies in Europe about the fate of the JCPOA after the Obama era comes to an end in January 2017. \n\nKelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association argued that prompt and complete Iranian compliance could have an effect on the continuing American debate. \u201cEstablishing a solid record of compliance will help thwart attempts to sabotage the agreement and demonstrate to US skeptics that Tehran is serious about restricting its nuclear program,\u201d she said.", "source": "Guardian.co.uk"}
