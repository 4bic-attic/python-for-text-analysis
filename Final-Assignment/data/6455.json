Most of the actual removal of contaminated soil will happen next year.\n\nBut the primary purpose of the hearing will be to let residents know about road closings, said Rodney Elliott, the EPA community involvement coordinator.\n\n\"We have been going door to door\" on Mill Street, which will be closed Monday, Sept. 28, he said. Traffic will be detoured around portions of Elm Street, as well.\n\nFletcher Paint's manufacturing and retail facilities were on Elm Street, and some contaminants were stored in a Mill Street shed.\n\nOn Sept. 29, EPA officials will also review the timeline for cleanup of soil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous waste that resulted from the storage of more than 800 drums of contaminated material behind the plant and in underground tanks.\n\nMuch of the cleanup work is being paid for by General Electric Co., which had arranged for the disposal of contaminants at the site. GE put the project out to bid last spring.\n\nThe driveway to Keyes Memorial Park will have to be closed in early October, and the town plans to use adjacent property at 127 Elm St. for an alternate entrance and exit to the park.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the EPA investigated the site after the discovery of volatile organic compounds in the adjacent Keyes Municipal Water Supply Well, which has been closed since then.\n\nAccording to plans finalized in 2008, the EPA will have 28,000 cubic yards of soil trucked from Milford to a landfill in New York, and another 28,000 cubic yards of clean material brought in to build a cap for the site.\n\nKathy Cleveland can be reached at 673-3100 or kcleveland@cabinet.com.\n\n/FileInclude:Normal, /csp/cms/sites/Telegraph/assets/html5/includes/summaryStory/paywallsummary.csp, took .000182 -- \n\nSign up to continue\n\nPrint subscriber?
