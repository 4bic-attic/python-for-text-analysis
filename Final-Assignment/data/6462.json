(NYSE:PCL) today announced it has \n      completed the sale of approximately 98,000 acres of timberlands in \n      west-central Florida to Hancock Timber Resource Group for approximately \n      $120 million. \n \n\u201cWe are pleased to conclude this transaction with Hancock Timber which \n      will continue to operate these lands as working forests,\u201d said Rick \n      Holley, chief executive officer. \u201cThe agreement allows our company to \n      take advantage of a market opportunity and reflects our long-term \n      strategy designed to upgrade the value and productivity of our \n      timberland portfolio over time through the identification and sale of \n      non-strategic lands. While these lands have been well-managed, the \n      significant hardwood component of the property didn\u2019t fit well with our \n      broader Southern timberland portfolio.\u201d \n \nPlum Creek is among the largest and most geographically diverse private \n      landowners in the nation with more than 6 million acres of timberlands \n      in 19 states. We also operate wood products mills in the Northwest. We \n      manage our working forests using sustainable practices to benefit Plum \n      Creek\u2019s many stakeholders. Our employees work together to create \n      shareholder value, serve as stewards of the environment, make wood \n      products for everyday use, and build strong communities.
