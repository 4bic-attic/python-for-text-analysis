We are disobeying a man-made unjust church law that discriminates against women in order to bring justice and equality to the church we love. We are a holy shakeup of Women Spirit Rising! Enjoy and share with your friends and justice seekers! Bridget Mary Meehan, ARCWP,\u00a0\nSpecial thanks to \u00a0Donna Rougeux, ARCWP and Barbara Billey, ARCWP who created this slideshow and to our members who shared their photos.
