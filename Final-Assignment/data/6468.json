Tomorrow, she will overtake the record set by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. In the third in a series of features to mark the historic day, we look back at her reign in papers. Next up is the 1980s. \n\n1981: Perfect! 750 million watch the royal fairy tale \n\nBy Stuart Collier and John Passmore\u00a0 \n\nTHE Prince and Princess of Wales began their married life together last night in the peace and seclusion of Broadlands, the country house where the Queen started her honeymoon 33 years ago. \n\nThey travelled to Romsey in Hampshire by special train after a million people lined their procession route in London to wish them well. \n\nYesterday, London\u2019s vast crowd and the 750 million television viewers worldwide witnessed a day in which pomp and pageantry vied with the pleasure and laughter \u2014 and anxiety \u2014 of a family wedding. \n   \nAnd then he kissed her: Prince Charles and Princess Diane give the cheering crowds on the Mall - and the world's media - what they want... a Buckingham Palace balcony embrace after their wedding ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral yesterday \n   \nDress of dreams: Prince Charles manages to avoid the 25ft train as he asks for a kiss from his bride \n\nIt began in earnest as Lady Diana Spencer came out of Clarence House in the great State Glass Coach looking breathtakingly beautiful, a Princess already, though not quite yet by right. \n SECRETS OF THAT DRESS WITH ITS 25FT LONG SILK TRAIN  \nThe romantic gown, made from six different fabrics, included 25 yards of ivory silk taffeta, 100 yards of tulle crinoline and 150 yards of netting in the veil. It was hand-embroidered with more than 10,000 tiny mother-of-pearl sequins and pearls. \n\nPrincess Diana had to rehearse walking with the fairytale 25ft silk train, the longest in royal history. To bring good luck, she wore old lace, new silk (specially spun in Dorset), a tiara borrowed from the Spencer family collection and a small blue bow, sewn into the dress of her waistband. \n\nA second good luck token, a tiny 18ct gold horseshoe studded with diamonds, was sewn into the intricate embroidery. \n\nIn keeping with royal tradition, most of the materials were made in Britain. The young couple she chose to design the dress, Elizabeth and David Emanuel, have been in business for only seven years. \n  \nIt ended with the marvellously human and delightful spectacle of Prince Charles and his bride being driven to Waterloo Station in an open landau astonishingly decorated with a mass of jazzy balloons bearing a heraldic crest \u2014 the Prince of Wales\u2019s feather. \n\nPinned to the back was a sign in huge, red lettering \u2014 it said \u2018Just Married\u2019 and was decorated with C and D hearts and arrows. That was the work of the bridegroom\u2019s brothers, Andrew and Edward. In an earlier age, such an event would have been unthinkable. \n\nBut the two young princes got it exactly right \u2014 matching the joke to the occasion. \n\n\u00a0And the sight of that improbably decorated coach, which made even the superbly disciplined members of the escorting Household Cavalry smile, was the perfect finale to a perfect day. \n\nIt was not just the magnificence of the ceremony, the beauty of the bride, the evocative music and the fine setting which made this a day to remember. \n\nIt was the behaviour of the people. London was one huge street party. Everywhere people were cheering, dancing. There had been worries about security. In the event, there were only a handful of arrests for minor offences. \n\nEvery section of the crowd \u2018adopted\u2019 the policeman standing in front, handing out food and even the odd glass of champagne. People came not only from every part of Britain, but from all over the world. On the day, at least, they were united in a sense of brotherhood \u2014 a mood which, alas, politicians never seem able to tap. \n   \nJust married: To Waterloo Station in a royal landau festooned with balloons after saying 'I do' \n\nIn the final analysis, however, what really made the occasion was the genuine sense that this was, after all, a family wedding. \n\nThere was the concern which everyone from the Queen down clearly felt for the bride\u2019s father, Lord Spencer, who was far from well but determined to go through this, the greatest day in the history of a family used to greatness. \n\nThere was the obvious nervousness of the groom as he walked up the great nave of St Paul\u2019s. There was the way his brother, Andrew \u2014 his \u2018supporter\u2019, he didn\u2019t have a best man \u2014 kept reassuring himself that he had the ring. \n   \nMr and Mrs: They go off on honeymoon \n\nThere was the bride herself emerging from the coach and momentarily, like so many, looking rumpled before David Emanuel, who designed her splendid dress, dashed forward to straighten folds which had been crushed during the drive. \n\n\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 she asked her father, concerned. \u2018Do you want to hold my arm as well for a moment?\u2019 \n\nThen, despite all the rehearsals, despite the fact that no wedding could have been better prepared, both bride and groom slipped up as they made their marriage vows. \n\nShe called him \u2018Philip Charles\u2019, instead of \u2018Charles Philip\u2019, and realising her mistake, looked flustered for the only time all day. \n\nThen he got the phrase, \u2018All my worldly goods with thee I share\u2019 completely wrong, saying instead: \u2018All thy goods with thee I share.\u2019 \n\nThat should be good for an endless series of family jokes in years to come \u2014 the Prince pledging himself to share his wife\u2019s wealth with her, leaving his own unencumbered! \n\nThere was the eccentric guest without whom no wedding is complete. Everyone whom the couple acknowledged in the cathedral bowed their heads; Spike Milligan, splendidly attired in grey, never once taking his immaculate white gloves off, waved back cheerily. \n\nThere was the choirmaster, conducting the 30 boy choristers of St Paul\u2019s. He got so carried away that his gesticulating arm caught one of the lamp shades, sending it flying only yards from the couple. \n\nThis produced a fit of giggles from the Prince, which he controlled only because of years of experience of ceremonial occasions. \n\nThe choir managed to suppress their own sniggers. But, as one said later: \u2018Next time we\u2019ll make sure we have a good slip fielder anywhere Mr Rose is conducting.\u2019 \n\nAs in all the best family weddings, there was the smallest bridesmaid who behaved to perfection until a moment of high importance. \n\nFive-year-old Clementine Hambro, who at any other wedding would have stolen the show, chose her appearance before hundreds of thousands on the Buckingham Palace balcony to start sucking her thumb. \n\nThere were the jokes as everyone lined up for the official photographs, taken in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace by the Queen\u2019s cousin, the Earl of Lichfield. The Princess was obviously very happy, but tired after the rigours of the day. Prince Charles made funny faces at her from behind the photographers to make her laugh even more. \n\nFinally, the Princess, as she boarded the train at Waterloo, impulsively bent forward and kissed the men who had organised her day so superbly \u2014 Lord \u2018Chips\u2019 Maclean, the Lord Chamberlain, and Sir John Johnston, Comptroller of the Queen\u2019s Household. \n\nOne suspects as the years go by she will learn to take these things for granted. But for the moment she was Lady Di again \u2014 not Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales. \n COMMENTARY BY... RICHARD BURTON\u00a0      \nFor 200 million radio listeners scattered across the world, the voice of majesty for the great day was that of Richard Burton. \n\nFor four hours he sat before a microphone in an underground studio at Broadcasting House. \n\nThe Hollywood star had written his own script which, delivered in his resonant voice, measured the splendour of the occasion. Afterwards he revealed that he had made his commentating debut because of his love of Wales. \n\nBurton, who is the same age as the Queen, and the son of a Welsh miner, said: \u2018I met the Prince of Wales twice, but not since he learned to speak Welsh. \n\n\u2018The first time I saw him speaking our language, it gave me a funny quiver down my spine.\u2019 Burton said that he had become emotionally involved in the broadcast of the wedding. \n\n\u2018As an actor, I felt enormously for that little girl, particularly when she went up the stairs with that enormous train,\u2019 he said. \n\n\u2018I have played so many princes myself that I know only too well how easy it is to get entangled in your own feet.\u2019 \n   GUN-TOTING BODYGUARDS DISGUISED AS FOOTMEN     \nKeeping watch: An armed policeman, right, scans the crowds from the back of the royal carriage \n\nTwo of the footmen perched on the back of the regal landaus were not what they seemed. They were armed detectives. \n\nHeavily disguised in powdered wigs, breeches, and scarlet and gold tunics, one was mounted on the Queen\u2019s coach and one on Prince Charles\u2019s. \n\nAs well as guns, each carried a concealed two-way radio, and instead of gazing straight ahead in the correct footman\u2019s style, their eyes constantly scoured the crowd for suspicious movement. \n\nScotland Yard\u2019s man in charge of security, Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Radley, said: \u2018The suggestion came from the palace and naturally we went along with it. \n\n\u2018I wondered what my officers would think when I asked for volunteers to adopt the dress of footmen, but the enthusiasm was such that we immediately had half-a-dozen volunteers.\u2019 \n   CLOSE FRIEND CAMILLA LEFT IN THE COLD AFTER SERVICE      \nLooking on: Camilia, wearing all white, stands with guests three rows back as Diana is given away \n\nBy Nigel Dempster\u00a0 \n\nCamilla Parker Bowles, 34, and Australian Lady Tryon, 33, the two happily married women who influenced Prince Charles most on personal matters and encouraged his courtship with Lady Diana, were surprisingly left out in the cold after the service. \n\nWhile 120 royal relatives and close friends drank Krug champagne at Buckingham Palace and feasted on quenelles of brill with lobster sauce, chicken breasts stuffed with minced lamb and strawberries with Cornish clotted cream, Dale Tryon organised her own festivities. \n\nAffectionately called \u2018Kanga\u2019 by Charles, Dale rounded up 65 friends at fashionable Knightsbridge restaurant San Lorenzo. \n\n\u2018I was not invited to the palace and I know Mrs Parker Bowles wasn\u2019t either,\u2019 says Dale. \u2018She is also holding a party for friends. Obviously I can\u2019t comment on why I wasn\u2019t invited to Camilla\u2019s event or the Palace, but I do not feel offended.\u2019 \n\nBoth ladies have sons whose godfather is Prince Charles. \n  \n1981: Trooping the colour drama \n\nIce cool Queen defies pistol-firing madman: Her expert horse skills save day in Mall attack\u00a0 \n\nThe Queen\u2019s expertise as a horsewoman saved her from a fall when a pistol was fired by a gun-obsessed teenager as she rode down the Mall to Trooping the Colour. \n\nThe noise of the six blanks caused her mount Burmese, a 19-year-old gelding, to rear and plunge in fright and break into a canter. \n\nAt once the Queen, riding side-saddle, allowed the reins to slide through the fingers of her left hand, before gathering them up with her right. This prevented the horse pulling her from the saddle by yanking on the bit with its mouth. \n   \nDrama on the Mall: As the Queen regains control of her alarmed horse, Burmese, police officers rush to the source of the gunfire \n\nThen came a reassuring pat on the neck to let Burmese know all was well. \n\nThe Queen knew that nervous or panicky behaviour on her part would have immediately been transmitted to the horse. Burmese wore iron shoes and a slip on the road surface could have caused him to fall with the Queen underneath. \n\nThe youth alleged to have been involved in the incident, Marcus Sarjeant, 17, was later charged with wilfully discharging near the person of Her Majesty The Queen a blank cartridge pistol, with intent to alarm her. \n\nHe was held at Cannon Row police station and will appear at Bow Street Magistrates\u2019 Court today. Police were expecting a visit from his mother, but by late last night she had not arrived. The charge carries a sentence of up to seven years\u2019 jail. \n\nThe soldier who grabbed Sarjeant said yesterday: \u2018I just wanted to get him \u2014 I felt anger and hate.\u2019 \n\nLance Corporal Alex Galloway, on duty in the Mall on Saturday, added: \u2018My only thought was to save the Queen\u2019s life.\u2019 \n\nAfter the first shots, he said he saw a man point a pistol. \n\n\u2018I thought it was a real gun and dived across the barrier into the crowd and grabbed him,\u2019 said the 36-year-old Scots Guardsman. \u2018I took him by the hair and pulled him into the Mall. Within seconds, the police arrived and took him away. I just went back to my position.\u2019 \n I thought about using my bayonet on him\u00a0  \nLance Corporal Galloway, married with two sons, added: \u2018With our Northern Ireland training, you want to get anyone with a gun. I just wanted to get the man who had shot at the Queen because I love the Royal Family. For a split second I thought about using my fixed bayonet on him, but I didn\u2019t need to. \n\n\u2018My rifle wasn\u2019t loaded, but I wouldn\u2019t have fired in that situation anyway. There were too many people around.\u2019 \n\nHis company commander, Major John Kiszerly, said: \u2018Lance Corporal Galloway won\u2019t say so himself, but he was very brave.\u2019 \n\nAs the drama unfolded, the Queen was being followed along the Mall by Prince Philip and Prince Charles on their horses. \n\nIt has led to fresh unease about the Royal Family\u2019s security, which is to be reviewed by Scotland Yard and the Government \n\nUnexpectedly, the Queen turned up to watch Prince Charles play polo at Smith\u2019s Lawn, Windsor, yesterday amid crowds and low-key security. \n\nPrince Philip was there, too, and Charles had earlier opened a riding-for-the-disabled event in Gloucestershire, where armed police were much in evidence. \n\nMore police will now be assigned to all royal engagements. But what the Yard recognises \u2014 as does the Queen \u2014 is that no protection can give total cover. \n CRACKSHOT CADET TO BE CHARGED WITH TREASON AFTER FIRING AT THE QUEEN     \nDetained: Marcus Sarjeant under arrest after firing a blank pistol near the Queen as she rode to Trooping the Colour \n\nThis is Marcus Sarjeant, the 17-year-old who is to appear in court today charged under the Treason Act with firing a blank pistol near the Queen as she rode to Trooping the Colour. \n\nWhen the picture was taken, he was an Air Training Corps cadet. He qualified for a marksman\u2019s badge and won a cup as best shot in the Dover squadron, 1979-1980. \n\nThat win was one of the most distinguished moments in what, until Saturday, was the ordinary young life of Marcus Simon Sarjeant. \n\nAfter school, he joined the Royal Marines, but quit four weeks into his basic training after realising \u2018he didn\u2019t like it at all\u2019, says a friend. \n\nTechnically unemployed, he had a job under the Youth Opportunities Scheme at the New Metropole Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, a few miles from his home in the village of Capel de Ferne. \n\nSarjeant\u2019s family can hardly believe what has happened. His grandmother, Mrs Sylvia Sarjeant, 70, wept at her home in Church Hougham, near Dover, and said: \u2018I love the Royal Family \u2014 every one of them, but especially the Queen and the Queen Mother, and I am heartbroken that my grandson should be charged with something like this.\u2019 \n\nVillagers in Capel le Ferne know Sarjeant as a likeable, uncomplicated, easygoing boy. \n  \n1982: Birth of Prince William \n\nNew prince goes home AND doesn't Di look proud!\u00a0 \n\nThe Princess of Wales made royal history last night by leaving hospital with her son 21 hours after his birth. \n\nNormal medical practice recommends a five to eight-day stay in hospital for new mothers. \n\nAt three minutes past six, the Princess appeared on the hospital steps. Beside her was Prince Charles carrying the baby born to be King wrapped in a white shawl. \n   \nNew parents: The Princess of Wales \u00a0proudly cradles her newborn son as she leaves hospital just 21 hours after his birth \n\nDiana, dressed in a white-spotted green maternity dress, looked radiant as she smiled and waved to the cheering well-wishers.\u00a0 \n\nThe 7lb 1\u00bdoz baby, who becomes second in line to the Throne after his father and who has yet to be officially named, has blue eyes like both his parents. \n\nDiana was in labour for just over 16 hours, and the baby \u2018cried lustily\u2019 when he came into the world in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u2019s Hospital, Paddington, West London. \n   \nDelighted: The Queen visited Princess Diana and baby at St Mary's Hospital \n\nPrince Charles had phoned the Queen at Buckingham Palace from the hospital to tell her the news of her third grandchild. \n\n\u00a0She was said to be \u2018delighted\u2019 and treated all the palace staff to champagne. \n\nThe new father showed considerable aplomb in coping with a noisy crowd outside, including one woman who planted a heavily lipsticked kiss on his cheek.\u00a0 \n\nHe described his son as \u2018in marvellous form\u2019, \u2018not bad\u2019 and \u2018looking lovely\u2019. \n\nDid the baby look like him? \u2018It has the good fortune not to,\u2019 said Prince Charles. What about names? \u2018We have thought of a number already, but there is a bit of argument over it. We will just have to wait and see.\u2019 \n\nA portable gramophone struck up Land Of Hope And Glory, Union flags were waved and voices raised in ecstatic cheering as the royal couple and their new son left for their London home at Kensington Palace a mile away through rush-hour traffic almost at a standstill because of an Underground strike. \n\nBy the time they arrived, the Prince was tenderly holding his son again. \n\nAs the car drew up in front of the palace, the Prince and Princess were greeted by other members of the Royal Family.Princess Margaret stepped forward and leaned through the window to kiss Diana. \n\nThen it was an early night for the Princess, 21 next Thursday, and her baby. \n THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE DIDN'T KEEP HIS PARENTS WAITING  \nAccording to Princess Diana\u2019s calculations, the baby was early: she had reckoned on her own birthday, July 1, which was still ten days away as her baby son arrived. \n\nBut, just in case, at recent engagements, including Royal Ascot, the Princess had been accompanied by two doctors. Meanwhile, Orion, the Daily Mail astrologer, predicts the new Prince will be intelligent and a romantic, with a strong vein of restlessness and a desire to roam. \n\nThe Royal Family\u2019s naval tradition will appeal to him and, in maturity, he will develop into a natural leader. \n  \n1982: A break-in at the palace:\u00a0 Queen found intruder sitting on her bed\u00a0 \n   \nMichael Fagan: Shinned up a drainpipe to the royal bedchamber \n\nThe father of Michael Fagan, the intruder who was found in the Queen\u2019s bedroom, said last night that he believed his son had got into Buckingham Palace three times in the past two months. \n\nOn each occasion, Fagan, 31, would leave his wife late at night and return home at 6am, saying he had been to visit his girlfriend at SW1, his father said. \n\n\u2018She obviously thought he was joking and disregarded him. But we were not so sure. \n\n\u2018When questioned by his mother and myself, my son said that his girlfriend was an older woman, married and had four children. He called her Elizabeth Regina. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure he had several goes, and he made it into the palace at least three times that we know of. There could have been many more.\u2019 \n\nThe father said that his son \u2018would not hurt a fly . . . and I\u2019m sure he did not intend to hurt, or even frighten, the Queen\u2019. \n\nThe intruder\u2019s mother described her son as a \u2018total royalist\u2019 who \u2018has not got the slightest bit of violence in his nature\u2019. \n\n\u2018He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting simply to talk and say hello and discuss his problems.\u2019 \n\nFagan appeared in court on Saturday and was remanded in custody, charged with trespassing and stealing half a bottle of wine. \n\nThe question of royal security has become a national crisis after it transpired that Fagan simply shinned up a drainpipe to the first floor, where the Queen was sleeping, pulled aside an anti-bird wire mesh and climbed in. \n\nAll this was while an extensive alarm system was supposed to be in operation and 21 policemen were on duty inside and outside the building, as well as the soldiers mounting formal guard. \n\nAfter initially believing that the alarm system wasn\u2019t working, it was later revealed that the palace\u2019s electronic security system did detect Fagan, and \u2018alarms were ringing all over the place\u2019. \n Her Majesty kept him talking for ten minutes\u00a0  \nEarly on Friday, the Queen woke up to discover the intruder sitting on the edge of her bed. She recalled later that he was wearing a T-shirt and trousers but was barefoot. \n\nHe had a slight cut on his hand \u2014 blood fell onto her bed \u2014 and was clutching a broken glass ashtray, a potentially vicious weapon. \n\nThe Queen calmly kept the man talking for ten minutes. They discussed his personal problems and how he had got into the palace. \n\nShe tried to summon help on the pretext of calling for a servant to get Fagan cigarettes, but the attempt failed. \n\nAlthough it is reported that the Queen is furious at the breakdown in security, she has appeared quite unruffled at coping \u2014 again \u2014 with a personal emergency. \n\nShe even entertained a group of dignitaries by mimicking a North Country chambermaid who exclaimed after the intruder was discovered: \u2018Bloody hell, Ma\u2019am, what\u2019s he doing in here?\u2019 \n\nHowever, police are now under fire, as it has transpired that the alarms were set off in the room which houses the stamp collection built up by successive monarchs. \n\nBut a policeman thought they had gone off by accident, as had apparently happened before. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s that bloody bell in the stamp room again,\u2019 he said \u2014 and switched them off without checking. It also emerged that when the Queen telephoned the palace police office on the pretext of fetching cigarettes, she tried to get across the message that she needed help \u2014 albeit without arousing the suspicions of Fagan. \n\nThe sergeant in charge, who took the call, failed to appreciate this and apparently did nothing. \n\nThe Queen then called a chambermaid, Elizabeth Andrews, to her bedroom. Without hesitating, Miss Andrews took the intruder firmly by the arm and led him into the corridor, where a footman took him into custody. \n RATTLED PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER: 'IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN'     \nRegret: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher \n\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by news of the intruder in the Queen\u2019s bedroom that she brought forward by a day her usual weekly audience with the Queen to express regret and concern. \n\nShe also took to the palace a promise to do everything possible to see that such a thing does not happen again. \n\nSenior ministers are under no illusion that the serious public fears about the protection of the Queen could cast doubt not only on those responsible for royal security but on the Government itself. In this light, MPs want to know: \nWere the palace\u2019s anti-burglar alarms switched off at the critical time of the break-in? Were police and security guards caught napping on a job that one MP claims is so boring, only the old are seconded to cover it? How was the intruder able to move freely inside the Queen\u2019s suite? Had any suggested security measures been turned down by the Royal Family because they would restrict their privacy or freedom to move about? \nThe hustle is understandable. The Government has never been more vulnerable on the law-and-order issue than now \u2014 for if the Queen cannot feel safe in her own bed, who can? \n\nHome Secretary William Whitelaw revealed that a review of security of the royal homes has been going on for the past 18 months. \n\nBut there were cheers for Shadow Secretary Roy Hattersley when he rebuked Mr Whitelaw: \u2018You said security had been recently improved. Since that resulted in a man getting into the Queen\u2019s bedroom, how bad was it before the improvement?\u2019 \n\nOne Tory MP told the Commons that security was lax at the palace because so many electronic security gadgets were installed that the police officers on duty found the job boring. \n\n\u2018The only officers who tend to go in for this duty are those at the end of their career who want a quiet life,\u2019 went on Patrick McNair-Wilson, who stood guard at the palace himself while serving with the Coldstream Guards. \n  \n1987: It's a Royal Knockout .\u00a0 Edward: It's a walkout! Prince throws a hissy fit after tepid response to game show\u00a0 \n   \nWindsor frolics: Organiser Prince Edward in costume\u00a0 \n\nPrince Edward dramatically stormed out on the Press last night in an extraordinary end to a day of fun. \n\nWhen journalists who had been barred from watching his It\u2019s A Knockout charity show greeted him in virtual silence, the 23-year-old Prince snapped: \u2018Great, thanks for being so bloody enthusiastic.\u2019 \n\nSeconds later, he suddenly pushed back his chair and stalked out saying: \u2018Right, that\u2019s it.\u2019 \n\nThat was the abrupt end to the Prince\u2019s day, which had begun at 6.30am when he arrived at the Alton Towers leisure park in Staffordshire to mastermind the televised The Grand Knockout Tournament \u2014 dubbed It\u2019s A Royal Knockout by the Press \u2014 in which Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of York also took part, alongside original It\u2019s A Knockout host Stuart Hall. \n\nNearly 14 hours later, a clearly tired Prince Edward arrived in a media tent to meet more than 50 journalists, many of whom had been unable to cover his spectacular contest except on TV monitors. They were forbidden to see it live because organisers feared it might jeopardise their exclusive rights. \n\nThe Prince began with a prepared vote of thanks to all those responsible for the day. Then ITN reporter Joan Thirkettle asked whether he was pleased with the events. Edward cut in and said: \u2018I have not finished.\u2019 \n\nHe continued with his thanks before turning on the journalists and asking: \u2018I only hope you have enjoyed yourselves \u2014 have you?\u2019 \n   \nPrincess Anne seems rather nonplussed by presenter of It's A Knockout Stuart Hall \n\nWhen the question failed to provoke a positive response, the Prince made his angry comment, adding: \u2018Well, what have you been doing all day?\u2019 \n\nWhen there was silence again, the Prince \u2014 who walked out on the Royal Marines in January \u2014 jumped to his feet and hurried out of the marquee. \n You lot are going to have to learn some manners\u00a0  \nStill clearly furious when he went to board a helicopter, he rounded on photographers and, wagging his finger, said: \u2018One day, you lot are going to have to learn some manners.\u2019 \n\nLater, the show\u2019s director, Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith, said the Prince was very tired. \n\nHe went on: \u2018What happened was not rudeness on his part. He had been up since 6am and the adrenaline of running the event had pumped him up. \n\n\u2018Perhaps there was a lack of rapport, but he has just staged probably the event of the year, and he was looking for someone to tell him that.\u2019 \n   \nGame for a laugh: The Duchess of York gets into the spirit \n\nEarlier, Edward, Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of York had thrown themselves into the day with enthusiasm. \n\nDespite pouring rain, the four young royals romped around in medieval costumes with stars of sport and showbusiness, including John Cleese, Tom Jones and John Travolta. \n\nPrince Edward, who had been supervising proceedings in a sweatshirt bearing the slogan \u2018No I just look like him\u2019, discarded it to join brother Andrew in doublet and hose, while the Duchess of York and Princess Anne exchanged their sou\u2019westers and wellies for flowing dresses in blue and red. \n\nIn their sharply contrasting styles, fun-loving Fergie and \u2018strong, silent\u2019 Princess Anne stole the show. \n\nThe Duchess of York, who bounced up and down with excitement and shouted herself hoarse, was the winner with the crowd and the assembled celebrities. \n\nBut her sister-in-law won the real contest for charity with her team\u2019s \u2018cool, calm and collected\u2019 approach to the knockabout games. The Duchess indulged in a playful fruit-throwing fight with her husband \u2014 egged on by comedian Pamela Stephenson, her old partner of pranks. \n\nApart from that, the four royal captains resisted the crazy games \u2014 although Edward offered to play the royal fool by putting his head on the stocks for \u00a350. \u00a0 \n 1982: ANDREW'S FALKLANDS RETURN: HOME IS THE HERO!      \nMan of action: The Duke of Edinburgh looks on approvingly as his son Prince Andrew acknowledges the cheers of the crowd on the dockside at Portsmouth on September 17. The Prince, who served as a Fleet Air Arm helicopter co-pilot during the campaign, was greeted by the Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
