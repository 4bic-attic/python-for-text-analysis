No free chicken wings for liars. \n\nRannazzisi also stars in the FX show \"The League.\" \n\nComedy Central was supposed to air Mr. Liar's comedy special this weekend, but hasn't decided whether to do so in light of the sudden bad publicity. \n\nIn this Aug. 7, 2015, file photo, Steve Rannazzisi participates in \"The League\" panel at the FX Summer TCA Tour at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) \n\n\"We just learned about this last night,\" Comedy Central said in a statement. \"We are very disappointed to hear about Steve's misrepresentations and are currently determining how we will move forward.\" \n\nRannazzisi had said he was working as an account manager for Merrill Lynch and escaped the south tower before the second plane hit. He also said the incident inspired him to go to Hollywood. \n\nTony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
