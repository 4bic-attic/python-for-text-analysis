Yeah, we actually got kind of excited for that one, well, it look looks like it\u2019s not going to happen\u2026 or at least, not with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. \n \nIt seems the Sony are looking at reinventing the Men In Black franchise. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, producers\u00a0Walter\u00a0Parkes\u00a0and\u00a0Laurie MacDonald have confirmed that the Men In Black movies are in for a radical reinvention because Smith isn\u2019t likely to return: \u201cMost likely no [Smith won\u2019t be back]. We\u2019re in the middle of it. It\u2019s very active.. It will be reinvented as a trilogy,\u201d they said. \n \nSurely a reboot is a silly idea with Men In Black? If any franchise lends itself to a new cast/same universe approach it\u2019s MiB, no? Still\u2026 the same could have been said about Ghostbusters. \n \nSony strikes again, it seems\u2026. \n \nSource: THR \n \nLet us know your thoughts below, @NerdFollowing on Twitter or on Facebook", "source": "Following The Nerd"}
