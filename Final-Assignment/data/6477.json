The company's CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg said as much during a Q&A Tuesday.\n\"I think people have asked about the dislike button for many years. Today is a special day because today is the day I can say we\u2019re working on it and shipping it,\" Zuckerberg said, according to a report in Business Insider.\nZuckerberg said that the social network didn't immediately design the button because it didn't want to turn into something like Reddit, with a system of upvoting and downvoting.\n\"That isn\u2019t what we\u2019re here to build in the world,\" Zuckerberg said. He added that the company realized Facebook users didn't necessarily want to downvote each other, they just wanted to have another option to \"Liking.\"\nLast December, during another Q&A interview at Facebook headquarters, Zuckerberg said that while the social network was mulling over a \"dislike\" button for users, he thought then that it might not happen.\n\"Some people have asked for a Dislike button because they want to be able to say \u2018That thing isn\u2019t good\u2019. And that\u2019s not something that we think is good for the world. So we\u2019re not going to build that,\" he said in answer to a question why the \"dislike\" button hasn't emerged. \"I don\u2019t think there needs to be a voting mechanism about whether posts are good or bad. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s socially very valuable or good for the community to help people share the important moments in their lives.\"\nZuckerberg also talked about his favorite emoji or sticker on Facebook at Tuesday's meeting. It's the cactus. Tweet Tweet Comments () Print Recommended Comments The views expressed are not those of this site, this station or its affiliated companies.
