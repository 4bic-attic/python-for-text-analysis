Look how well developed it is,\" she remarked as she observed images of the 18-week fetus. \n \n\"We need a woman president,\" said Lacey Thomas, the expectant mother who relaxed, belly-out, here in front of a dozen television cameras, as the presidential candidate left. \n    \nFiorina stood out in the most recent Republican debate in part for her passionate bashing of Planned Parenthood, the women's health organization recently under fire thanks to a series of secretly taped, edited videos accusing the abortion provider of breaking federal laws by profiting off the sale of organs and tissues of aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood denies that it has broken any laws. \n \nBut conservative lawmakers -- including some of Fiorina's White House rivals -- have threatened to shutdown the government unless Congress passes a ban on funding the group.", "source": "Bayou Buzz"}
