I hope you get something out of my modest efforts to explore science. \n What\u2019s with the name of the blog?  \nCode4Life was a name I considered for my consultancy,\u00a0 BioinfoTools .\u00a0It plays on a number of things related to my work and what I write about: \n  My work involves\u00a0programming (coding) for life sciences (molecular biology and genetics).  The data I examine and write algorithms for are the sequences of bases in DNA (genes, genomes), the amino acid sequences of proteins (enzymes, hormone receptors, etc.) and the three-dimensional atomic structures of proteins. These are the codes\u00a0 in life, the \u2018information base\u2019 of biology and life. (If readers are interested in an introduction to this, let me know.)  It can mean moral codes and other \u2018rules\u2019 people guide their lives with. I won\u2019t be\u00a0writing about this much about this in the sense of rules for\u00a0 life ,\u00a0but I may look at role of honest skepticism, logic and testing in science.  You can stretch it to be about writing about life sciences, writing being a code of sorts.  It has nothing to do with\u00a0 The Code for Life , an album of the heavy metal band\u00a0 Warrior .\u00a0I am\u00a0not a fan of heavy metal. (Sorry, heavy metal fans.)   The banner photograph  \nMy current banner image is temporary (but seems to permanent); I hope to later replace with something reflecting the title of the blog. The image shows where the\u00a0village I was based in on the Otago peninsula. (The image is open source,\u00a0 obtained from wikimedia and\u00a0edited using\u00a0 GraphicConverter v6.5.1.) \n Topics  \nMost articles mostly\u00a0target a general audience. I\u2019ll try remember to let you know if I think an article is\u00a0a bit geeky for general readers; once in a while I may write assuming a little basic background for those with deeper interests. \n \nLikely topic areas include: \n  Genetics, epigenetics, genomics and evolution. Science is an endless outpouring of stunning or unexpected\u00a0new findings\u00a0each week\u2026 (Readers might think that as a computational biologist that I mostly read computer methods; in practice\u00a0I mostly read genetics, epigenetics, genomics and evolution, the \u2018data\u2019 I work with.)  Human biology, esp. cognitive neuroscience and rare diseases or disabilities.\u00a0The workings of our minds is fascinating stuff and it\u2019s intriguing to explore others\u2019 lives.  \u2019What science is\u2019, what the basic terms mean, how to read a report on\u00a0science, sorting out the good stuff from the bad.  Science communication, including the media.  \u2018Natural remedies\u2019 vs. science-based medicine. The na\u00efve presentation of some of the \u2018woo\u2019 can be appalling.  Vaccination. (I now rarely write on this; this is Helen\u2019s expertise and covered in her blog, Diplomatic Immunity .)  Genetically modified-organisms (GMOs) and genetic engineering (GE).  Issues within science, especially within New Zealand. Science is a great\u00a0enterprise, but there\u2019s always room for improvement.  Developments in computational biology (my profession).  Computing & computers (the tools of my trade).  Plain old ruminations. We all have our navel-gazing days\u2026   \nReaders are encouraged\u00a0to ask questions and suggest topics they\u2019d like covered. \n \nI don\u2019t claim to be a\u00a0gifted philosopher or an expert on matters far and wide,\u00a0in fact I\u2019m frequently embarrassed by my sheer stupidity\u2026 Aren\u2019t we all? Some of my articles will be off my specialist expertise (I\u2019ll let you know if I feel that\u2019s needed). Readers are most\u00a0welcome to correct any errors but please substantiate your claims. You\u2019ll also help yourself if you be polite about corrections, rather than be insistent or worse about them. \n My scientific background  \nBy training I\u2019m a computational biologist, a biologist who uses computers\u00a0(algorithms, statistics, etc.) to explore biological problems, and who\u00a0develops computer tools for biologists to explore data from genes, genomes and\u00a0proteins. I work as an independent scientist through my consultancy,\u00a0 BioinfoTools ,\u00a0contracting to research groups and biotech companies. More about my research interests can be found on the consultancy website. \n \nA more commonly-known name for the field is \u2018bioinformatics\u2019 but\u00a0strictly speaking that term originally applied to a subset of the field. Some of us\u00a0who started before the genome era prefer the computational biology label,\u00a0for a variety of reasons. \n \nI am open to writing\u00a0contracts or other work (e.g. editing). \n \n\n Comment policy  \nMore than two links included in a comment will cause it to be held up for moderation. \n \nI would like to encourage friendly and open discussion. People are encouraged to put forward alternative views \u2013 don\u2019t be shy, jump in! \n \nTo help keep conversation open and friendly , if a commenter is\u00a0too\u00a0disruptive,\u00a0continuing to be argumentative, slighting others, etc., after being asked not to I may choose to block them from commenting for a week (or similar). If a commenter tries to write to me or the blog while they are \u2018on probation\u2019 the week gets extended, cumulatively. I only set the initial week \u2013 extensions are in the hands of commenter. For a little \u2018geek flavour\u2019, the cumulative increase follows a Fibonacci series. For each comment or message whilst on probation, the next in the series is added to the number of weeks off \u2013 i.e. best to just sit the time out. Finally: I would like to never have to exercise this, but if someone persistently disrupts what I would like to achieve with this blog, I reserve the right to ban them. \n \nComments that I consider are aimed at promoting a business rather than contributing to a discussion will likely be treated as spam and deleted. (It\u2019s a judgement call; please don\u2019t get annoyed about\u00a0it.) \n \nReaders are welcome to use pseudonyms, but please avoid using commercial companies\u2019 names. \n \n\n Copyright  \nJournalists, editors & publishers, a gentle reminder: the material on my blog is\u00a0copyright. You are welcome to contact me if you wish to use this material. Generally I\u2019m happy to help those where the content might be useful. Commercial outlets should be aware that as a consultant I don\u2019t do this work on the back of a set salary, and so tend to have similar views to freelance writers. \n \n\n Writing  \nBelow is a list of articles for general readers that I consider are better efforts.\u00a0Generally older articles are nearer the top.\u00a0As this is intended to list those\u00a0for general readers \u00a0 I have, for the time being,\u00a0left out several topic areas such as science-related trivia, book reviews and material aimed more technical audiences such as articles on computing technologies or computational biology. \n  Monkey business, or is my uncle also my Dad? \u00a0For male pygmy marmosets, their genetic father could be their uncle. Confused? Check it out.\u00a0I still get regular visits to this early effort.  GMOs and the plants we eat: neither are \u2018natural\u2019 \u00a0An attempt to point out that, among other things, both our \u2019natural\u2019 foods and GMOs are not really \u2018natural\u2019.  Deleting a gene can turn an ovary into a testis in adult mammals \u00a0I was startled to learn that ovaries may\u00a0 not \u00a0be permanently defined to be ovaries in some adult mammals.  The inheritance of face recognition (should you blame your parents if you can\u2019t recognise faces?) \u00a0Prosopagnosia is surprisingly common and has fascinated me for years.  Epigenetics, a confused muddle in the media \u00a0My biological research interests involve\u00a0some aspects of epigenetics: here I make a gentle prod at epigenetics being oversold in media.  Aww, crap. \u00a0Some pitcher plants have adapted to be tree-shrew toilets\u2026  Book sales, frumpy readers, and mental rotation of book titles \u00a0While at the famous-in-Dunedin 24-hour book sale I wondered if there was a \u2018right\u2019 orientation to scan rows of books. (Nominated by a reader for OpenLaboratory 2010.)  I remember because my DNA was methylated \u00a0Epigenetics meets neural systems, meets memories. I get a little lyrical in the beginning, which I confess I enjoyed.  Boney lumps, linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing \u00a0Looking for the basis of inherited bone spurs.  Temperature-induced hearing loss \u00a0This was a surprise to learn: a few rare individuals have temperature-sensitive hearing, losing it when they have a high body temperature.  Loops to tie a knot in proteins? \u00a0How proteins fold is an interest from my Ph.D. student days. A few proteins do more than just collapse on themselves in folding: they also tie knots, threading the chain through itself.  Preserving endangered species \u2014 of gut microbes \u00a0A interesting idea \u2013 new to me \u2013 that we should not only conserve rare species of animals but also microbes in our gut that reflect now rare diets.  Coiling bacterial DNA \u00a0DNA in cells is rarely \u2018naked\u2019, it is packaged with proteins. This article presents a new model for bacterial DNA packaging.  Finding platypus venom \u00a0Researchers cleverly did not\u00a0 extract \u00a0the venom, but created possible venom proteins\u00a0by comparing the platypus genome with known venomous proteins and expressing the genes that matched. (One of my favourites, platypuses are extraordinary creatures.)  Autistic children and blood mercury levels \u00a0Leaving aside autism, the study covered here reveals where we get mercury from.  Genetic tests and personalised medicine  Monday potpourri: maps, malaria in the USA, cholera in Dunedin and vaccines \u00a0Three very short pieces chained a line of thought.  Honey\u2019s antibiotic properties found? \u00a0One group played off different\u00a0compounds found in honey to determine the contributions of each to antibiotic effect and the strength of combinations.  Rubella, not a benign disease if experienced during early pregnancy \u00a0As a \u2018rubella kid\u2019 this topic is close to my heart in it\u2019s own way.  Autism \u2013 looking for parent-of-origin effects \u00a0Some genes are expressed in a way that depends on what parent the gene was from. I report on a study looking at autism this way.  Doggie ERVs \u00a0We have in our genomes endogenous retroviruses, ERVs. Turns out that man shares ERVs with his (her) best friend.  Haemophilia \u2013 towards a cure using genetic engineering \u00a0Using \u2018designer\u2019 zinc finger proteins to insert a working copy of a missing gene.  Carrots for my neighbour \u00a0A longer-form effort\u00a0exploring growing veges, genetic modification and supplementing plants with additional minerals in this case, calcium.  C\u2019s founder is no more \u00a0Explaining to non-geeks why Kernigan\u2019s passing means much to those in the computer science and computing industries.   Footnotes  \nI hope to\u00a0revise the list of articles above to strict reverse order of publication (i.e. most recent article first), and add newer examples.\u00a0An older list of articles can be found on\u00a0 the anniversary \u00a0of my first year of blogging. \n \nI have\u00a0countered various health claims\u00a0and pseudo science over the years through a perhaps misplaced sense of moral obligation. I suspect these articles stick in mind for some\u00a0readers. It might surprise readers\u00a0to learn that I prefer to write articles about science itself, particular genetics and epigenetics. \n \nThe post About Code for Life appeared first on Sciblogs .", "source": "Sciblogs \u00bb Blogs \u00bb Code for life"}
