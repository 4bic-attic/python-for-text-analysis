Have been playing guitar for about 10 years, many of my original lessons were from James Ashby (from The Quotes) who is now touring with T'Pau.

Influenced by Arctic Monkeys, Foo Fighters, QOTSA, Fall Out Boy, Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kaiser Chiefs, Editors, Royal Blood, AFI, Bring me the Horizon, the list goes on. Equipment: Gibson Les Paul and Fender Frontman 212r amp and pedal board.\rIf there's something you want to see/hear me play let me know.
