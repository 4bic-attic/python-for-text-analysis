The Rottnest Island seagulls watching me enjoying a bowl of corn flakes seemed to think it was actually yesterday morning when Jill took the photo.  But much as I like seagulls, I can confidently assure all of these birds that I am not their father. My proudest achievement during my seventy years is that I am the father of nine wonderful children \u2013 six handsome sons Luke, Ken, Terry, Tim, Dale and Glen and three beautiful daughters, Fiona, Peta and Kylie.  Nowadays when visiting Rottnest something every day reminds me of when all of them at one time or another accompanied Jill and I on our adventurous holidays to this still beautiful island.  Over time they have all ridden their bicycles, befriended Quokkas and built sandcastles on the beaches of Rottnest. Jill and I can also identify the many different bungalows we have stayed in, and the approximate ages of our kids at the time.  So today on this particular Father\u2019s Day only our youngest daughter Kylie is with us on the island, but I\u2019m pretty sure all the others will make contact by phone sometime to wish me well.\n\n\u00a9 MMXV Paul R.
