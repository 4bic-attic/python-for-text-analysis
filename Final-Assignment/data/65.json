He initially planned to ask to serve his jail term in Hong Kong. \u2018He was desperate not to serve a jail term in the UK because he said he would be singled out and beaten up as a sex offender there,\u2019 O\u2019Neill said. \n\nHowever, when a lawyer in Hong Kong told him he must serve his term in the UK, Tsang considered fleeing to the nearby Chinese gambling resort of Macau, which has no UK extradition treaty, or slipping into Thailand on a false passport. \n\nHe eventually decided to stay in hiding in Hong Kong and around ten days ago moved into an unfurnished 28th floor flat in the city\u2019s Ap Lei Chau district. \n   \nSkater: Tsang is circled above in Dancing On Ice, which he appeared on in 2009 alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean \n\nO\u2019Neill \u2013 who makes a living selling electronic goods on eBay \u2013 said: \u2018Joey was a nice guy but when I saw him this time, he wasn\u2019t the guy I used to know. He seemed to have gone a bit crazy. When he spoke about the UK cases, he said he did have sex with the girls but insisted it wasn\u2019t rape.\u2019 \n\nStephanie said: \u2018When we went to see him, he was always asking me for girls and looking at the girls on my Facebook page and saying, \u201cSet me up with her\u201d. He was creepy.\u2019 \n\nO\u2019Neill stayed in daily contact with police in the UK and Hong Kong as he continued visiting Tsang while an extradition order was drawn up. \n\nTsang, meanwhile, grew increasingly paranoid, using binoculars to watch for police cars and monitoring the internet for news of the manhunt for him. Yesterday, Tsang appeared in a Hong Kong court where he was remanded in custody. A lawyer representing him said he would contest extradition. \n\nTory MP Nicola Blackwood, for Oxford West and Abingdon, said last night: \u2018Tsang inflicted a living nightmare on his victims but ran like a coward when he faced justice. I want to thank The Mail on Sunday for their help. It is going to make a big difference to the victims.\u2019 \n\nA Home Office spokesman said Tsang\u2019s sister\u2019s passport was clean and therefore did not arouse suspicion at Heathrow because he was not on a flight risk database. \n\nShe added: \u2018Ultimately it is an airline\u2019s responsibility to check a passport matches the person travelling.\u2019 \n\nA spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: \u2018We do not comment on security matters.\u2019", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
