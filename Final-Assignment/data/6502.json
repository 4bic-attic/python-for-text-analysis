That is why I prefer to give them out [on loan].\u201d \n \n\u201cAnd I am a bit scared about that because in France they play in Division Three with their reserves so you get competition against adults. In England you have created the under-21 league.\u201d \n \n\u201cI am not a fan of it because it is not the same as playing in competitive games. In many under 21 games there is no build-up before the game. There is not the pressure of the competition. There is not the results you have to stand up for.\u201d", "source": "Backpageheadlines.com"}
