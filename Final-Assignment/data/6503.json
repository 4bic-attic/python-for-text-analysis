Before diving into the film industry, Stone says she started as a dancer at the age of 17-years-old. She was taught to carry a fake ID in the event that she would be caught, but to her delight, she stayed out of trouble. After meeting a man by the name of \u201cFamous\u201d the following year, Stone decided to switch up her profession by getting into prostitution. Stone says the 38-year-old housed a sizable amount of women, including Stone who would make $1500 a night. In those days, Stone says she had to meet with 10-15 men to make her desired quota. While the stigma of an abusive relationship are often heard in the field, Stone says she only had one moment with Famous that involved her \u201cteeth tearing through her lip.\u201d She explained how she was feisty with Famous until he put his hands on her. After being the game for about a year, Stone moved from California to Nebraska to change her lifestyle. She went back to school to get her diploma and even got a job as a telemarketer. She later decided to move back to L.A to pursue her career in the industry. Check out the rest of the beauty\u2019s interview above. http://bit.ly/1YHmx2Z", "source": "Hip-Hop News"}
