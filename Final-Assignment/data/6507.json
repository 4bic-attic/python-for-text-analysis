Spartan\u2019s Pub actually opened almost three months ago in what was the Oceanside Lounge on Hickory Grove Rd. in Davenport, while I was still driving by where I thought it was going to be on Brady, just south of Kimberly (thanks to Rick Martin of quadcitiesdiningguide.com for the heads up).\u00a0 As far as the place I didn\u2019t get the sense that they\u2019d changed much, though it had been a while since I\u2019d been to the Oceanside. \u00a0Still a serviceable neighborhood dive. I knew that The Enchanted Inn in far west Davenport had changed its name to Dee\u2019s Catfish Cove some time ago, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going there and adding it to my total until they put up a new sign.\u00a0 They did, so I did.\u00a0 No other changes, nothing else to report. Clint\u2019s Pizza closed over the summer at Highland Park Bowl, but the owner found an old service station on 7th St. in Moline and turned it into Clint\u2019s Draft House.\u00a0 Nice size U-shaped bar with 13 ft. ceilings, tinier restaurant area then the prior location, but a nice patio out front. Last addition is (was) the Ruby Tuesday\u2019s that used to be in Northpark Mall.\u00a0 I\u2019d forgotten the time or two we stopped there after doing some Christmas shopping (actually, I forgot it was ever there).\u00a0\u00a0 With those 5 additions, my total is 567. Other bar news: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Word is Cabana\u2019s will be reopening (same name ownership, so no opportunity to add to my list).\u00a0 This creates nice bar enclave east of the Rock Island District, along with The Polish Pub, Rooster\u2019s, Rozz-Tox, Bent River, and Gunchie\u2019s. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analog Arcade Bar, which will be an old-school pinball / video game bar in downtown Davenport, somewhat cryptically announced they will open 10/23/2015 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Le Figaro / Star Bar in downtown Rock Island closed the end of June, leaving us without one of my favorite bartenders (and one of the first to serve me in the Quad Cities), Darryl. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of favorite bartenders, Maddy has moved from Caddy\u2019s in Bettendorf to The Starting Line in Davenport, and a new addition to my list, Charlee splits her time between Governor\u2019s in Bettendorf and The Starting Line. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ve taken Rascal\u2019s Live of my What\u2019s Left list, as it\u2019s part of Rascal\u2019s, with no separate bar.\u00a0 With the others I knocked off, the list is at 7. BAR NET GAIN/LOSS With this post, I\u2019m beginning a project to see what the net bar loss / gain is in the Quad Cities since I started tracking this back in May of 2009.\u00a0 This is a bit of a memory stretch, so please comment if you recall any other changes.\u00a0 I begin with Davenport: Bars that closed after 5/1/09 (that haven\u2019t reopened, or is no longer a bar): 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nan\u2019s Piano Bar 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Balls and Pucks 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Penguins 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tiki Bar at Modern Woodmen 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Frick\u2019s Tap 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joe\u2019s Club 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vivian\u2019s Tap 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blueport Junction 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Big Daddy\u2019s 10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Graze 11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ruby Tuesday Locations that were not open as a bar on 5/1/09 that are now bars (including other bars at the same location): 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Barrel House 211 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great River Brewery 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brady St Pub >The Starting Line 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cru 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bix Lounge 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Black Hawk Bowl & Martini Lounge 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DaVinci\u2019s > The Office 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me & Billy 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Front Street Tap Toom 10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bleyart\u2019s Tap 11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brew In The Village 12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stickman\u2019s 13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Grape Life 14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The J Bar 15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Symposium Caf\u00e9 > Red Lantern 16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Los Agaves (Utica Ridge) 17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Osaka 18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R Bar 19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bad Boy\u2019z Pizza 20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pint\u2019s 21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Barrel House (Utica Ridge) If my memory is correct, that\u2019s a +10 net for Davenport.
