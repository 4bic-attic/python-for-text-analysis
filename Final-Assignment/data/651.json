Instead, I asked: \u201cWhat\nbroadcast network did \u2018The Mindy Project\u201d air on?\u201d She said: \u201cNBC!\u201d \u00a0 \n\nIt\u2019s a confusing media world for sure. \n\n\u201cMindy\u201d was on Fox; now\nat Hulu; \u201cNine-Nine\u201d is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what\nnetwork it\u2019s on? Branding, schmanding! \n\nOn the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food\nand Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. \n\nOver the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the\nsports network-- but on CNBC, NBC\u2019s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I\u2019m \u201ccycling\u201d in and out of stock investments in my\nportfolio. \n\nSeeing content in places you don\u2019t expect? Not a trend. \n\nStill, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.\nTurner airs plenty of NCAA Men\u2019s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV \u201cVideo Music Awards\u201d this year on many more of its cable networks. \n\nMuch of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. \n\nSo with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV\nviewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like \u201cSupergirl\u201d and \u201cThe Muppets\u201d? (\u201cSupergirl\u201d will be on CBS; \u201cThe Muppets,\u201d ABC\u201d). \n\nYes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. \n\nYet in the future, established TV network brands might want\nto be a lot of more than they are.", "source": "Media Post"}
