Their main roads have been repaired where needed. Even North Adams, Cummington and Goshen have smooth roads. \n \nThere is construction all around Easthampton to improve roads. What\u2019s wrong with this city? \n \nYou want a fun ride? Take a trip up Williston Avenue towards the high school. That road has many, many patches; it\u2019s like riding on a roller coaster. Potholes are showing up again and you can\u2019t blame that on winter. Easthampton has repaired East Street, which was needed. It paved Clark Street. Why? It\u2019s a side street. The conditions of the roads in Easthampton are an embarrassment to the city. The roads have never been this bad. What happened to the money that was allocated for road repair? Is it being used for something else? \n \nAnother winter will be upon us in a couple of months. I say, let\u2019s fix these roads before snow arrives. \n \nJoanne Kovalski \n \nEasthampton", "source": "Daily Hampshire Gazette"}
