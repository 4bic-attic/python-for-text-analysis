And while making jam is pretty satisfying, and the thought of slathering this on toast in January gives me a kick, I missed painting today.\u00a0 Actually this would make a great Found Still Life...so, maybe tomorrow's subject matter was today's Home Ec. project.", "source": "A Gena-a-day Artist's Blog"}
