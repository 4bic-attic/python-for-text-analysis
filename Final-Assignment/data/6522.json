And consumers will need to change their habit\u00a0of swiping their credit cards to pay: Instead, they\u00a0\u201cdip\u201d their new cards into terminals and leave them there until the transaction is complete. That is, if the retailer they\u2019re shopping at has the necessary\u00a0equipment. \n \nFiserv, a provider of financial services technology, estimates that 90% to\u00a095%\u00a0of American retailers are not prepared. \u00a0Another estimate isn\u2019t quite as dire:\u00a0The Strawhecker Group, a management consulting company for the payments industry,\u00a0found in a survey released Sept. 17\u00a0that 27% of merchants in the U.S. will be able to process chip-enabled cards by Oct. 1.\u00a0The survey was based on 62 payment-service providers that work with over a quarter of the U.S. merchants that accept credit cards. \u00a0 \n \nThe post appeared first on CUInsight .", "source": "Credit Union Insight"}
