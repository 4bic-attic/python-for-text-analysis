They enter Saturday\u2019s game at Fresno State tied for third nationally in interceptions (five) and turnover margin (six gained, one lost). \n\n\u201cWe went a couple of years there, we couldn\u2019t get an interception to save our lives,\u201d Whittingham said. \u201cNow it seems like we\u2019re over that hump hopefully and creating takeaways with our defense, which is helping our offense.\u201d \n\nConversely, he added, the offense is taking care of the ball and not putting the defense in any bad situations. \n\n\u201cSo it works hand in hand,\u201d Whittingham said. \n\nUtah\u2019s five interceptions, thus far, have already surpassed the season total of 2013. The Utes picked off just three passes that year. In 2014, they upped the tally to 12. \n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re more athletic in the back end and I think that helps our cause. I think that we\u2019re capitalizing on opportunities,\u201d Whittingham explained. \u201cWe had a lot of missed opportunities the past few years, where we have interceptions in our hands and dropped them. We seem to be capitalizing on those opportunities more this year. So a combination of those two things.\u201d \n\nTweaks, adjustments and modifications, he continued, come into play a little bit as well. \n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s more just the fundamentals and technique and capitalizing on the balls that are there to be intercepted,\u201d Whittingham said. \n\nSafeties coach Morgan Scalley acknowledged that things are different every year. \n\n\u201cSome of the interceptions we got this year have been thrown right to us and great job coming down with them \u2014 some teams, they drop those,\u201d he said. \u201cOur defensive backs, we work ball drills every single day, so that\u2019s obviously something that shows up.\u201d \n\nThe turnover circuit drills have paid off in the form of two interceptions by safety Marcus Williams and single picks by linebacker Gionni Paul, safety Tevin Carter, nickel back Justin Thomas and cornerback Cory Butler-Byrd. Utah\u2019s other takeaway is a fumble recovery by Paul. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really supposed to talk about the last few games but our practice and our preparation puts us in position to make these plays,\u201d said Williams, who reiterated that the defense is capitalizing on opportunities and doing a lot of film study. \n\nThere\u2019s an experience factor, too. Five defensive starters had interceptions last season. Paul and Carter led the way with four and two, respectively. Defensive end Jason Fanaika, cornerback Dominique Hatfield and Williams also picked off passes. \n\nUnlike 2014, though, Utah isn\u2019t leading the nation in sacks. The Utes have just two this season, well off the pace that netted 55. \n\nEven so, they\u2019re still getting the job done on defense. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not getting sacks you want to get hits on the quarterback. It\u2019s one thing we are getting. We\u2019re getting hits on the quarterback,\u201d Scalley said. \u201cTeams are doing some different things to combat and we\u2019ve been fairly basic the first couple of weeks. We\u2019ve got a good defensive line. We have different ways of bringing pressure and right now our base defense has been working well for us. Obviously the turnovers have been big for us.\u201d \n\nThe sacks, he added, are going to come.", "source": "Deseret Morning News"}
