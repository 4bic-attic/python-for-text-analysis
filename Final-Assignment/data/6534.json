He once swallowed 1,248 pistachios in five minutes, chipping his tooth on a stray shell. He once ate a hot dog while suspended upside-down from a crane, and another time submerged in nine feet of water while weighted down by concrete blocks. \u201cSo now, retired from the competitive gluttony circuit at age 66, Hurst carries the scars of a professional eater, the sport he pioneered. \u201cHe knows what it\u2019s like to chew so fast you stick a fork through the side of your face. He can explain how watermelon seeds tear the lining of your throat when you eat 21 of the king-sized fruits in 10 minutes. He can describe how it feels when your pulse shoots to 150 and your (systolic) blood pressure hits 252. (A-E note: For you medical neophytes, that\u2019s the maximum arterial pressure when your left ventricle contracts; it\u2019s too high by a factor of 100 percent. Here\u2019s an analogy: Imagine a tire blowing out or a cranial or aortic aneurysm. Quick lay medical summary: that stratospheric pressure could kill you) \u201c\u2018It\u2019s like the top of your head is going to blow off,\u2019 he said, calling from his family ice business in Martin County, N. C. \u2018It\u2019s like you\u2019re filling up with water from your feet to your head.\u2019 \u201cDid Eatin\u2019 Mort Hurst want to add his voice to physicians\u2019 warnings? Should we tell America not to eat 750 shrimp in one sitting? \u201cThe old champ told (Shaeffer), who\u2019s paraphrasing here: \u2018Duh.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What a lot of people don\u2019t know is this: Competitive eaters are athletes,\u2019 he said. \u201cYou have to train to do these things. You don\u2019t just go out and sit at a table and eat. That\u2019s a sure way to die. If you drink a gallon of water straight down, it can kill you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of stomach. Consider that Hurst had a stroke in 1991 after his egg feat, which left him fighting slurred speech and slowed movement on the right side. He kept competing another four years. (A-E\u2019s arithmetic addition: that\u2019s when he was 41 years old, a frightening calculus) Page 2 of 2 - Shaeffer\u2019s story \u201claid out how the training regimen of contemporary gobbling kings Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut can involve eating upwards of 60 hot dogs or drinking a gallon of water in a sitting.\u201d A-E\u2019s confident everyone understands the point by now: Eating or drinking too much at a single sitting, enough for say 15 normal people, is really absolutely potentially deadly dangerous. To quote a famous former eating champ \u201cDuh.\u201d A-E\u2019s uncontroversial statement about a college education A four-year college degree has been sold as the golden ticket in our economy. Evidence: June unemployment statistics. The national unemployment rate in June was 5.3 percent. But it was only 2.5 percent for people with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and 5.4 percent for high school graduates. Those without high school sheepskins: a forlorn 8.2 percent. A-E agrees that the national conversation about what higher education means must continue. Sometimes two-year degrees or technical certificates will suffice for comfortable livings. An example: A-E\u2019s North Carolina neighbor Skip held an electrical engineering bachelor\u2019s degree, a tough diploma to earn. Skip recommended instead computer and internet credentials such as A+, Network + or other training in specific systems such as Cisco. Each certificate, typically earned within six weeks, can be worth generous salaries. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2013The columnist writes his columns on a wood-fired computer in Canisteo", "source": "Hornell Evening Tribune"}
