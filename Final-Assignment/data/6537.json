The boys are nine months old and two years old. \n\nAccording to firefighters the mom said she got into a fight with the father of one of the boys. \n\nHe then told her he didn\u2019t want them anymore. Firefighters called police and CPS. \n\nThey spoke with the mother and did not charge her at the time. \n\nThe children are too old to fall under the state's Safe Haven law which allows parents to drop off a baby 60-days-old or younger without legal penalties. \n\nThey are now with CPS while investigators try to contact other relatives. We want to know what you think about this story. \n\nShould she face any charges? Sound off on", "source": "ABC6 On Your Side"}
