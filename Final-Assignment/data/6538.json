of the draconian austerity measures in the third memorandum imposed by Greece's creditors and eight months of rule in the midst of recession,\u202d \u202cclosed banks and capital controls,\u202d \u202cSYRIZA's vote fell by only\u202d \u202c0.88%\u202d \u202cand its parliamentary seats by just four. \n \nOn September\u202d \u202c20,\u202d \u202cSYRIZA won\u202d \u202c35.46%\u202d

\u202c7.36%\u202d \u202ctoday. \n \nThe ND vote increased marginally,\u202d \u202cfrom\u202d \u202c27.81%\u202d \u202cto\u202d \u202c28.1%,\u202d  \u202cbut it lost a seat,\u202d \u202cfalling from\u202d \u202c76\u202d \u202cto\u202d \u202c75. \n \nIn January,\u202d \u202cSYRIZA was the leading party in\u202d \u202c42\u202d \u202cof Greece's\u202d \u202c56\u202d \u202cconstituencies and ND in\u202d \u202c14\u202d \u202c\u2014 figures that remained the same.\u202d \u202cSYRIZA overtook ND as the leading party in three regional constituencies,\u202d \u202cwhile ND replaced SYRIZA as leading party in another three. \n \nPolls \n \nThis result flew in the face of all the opinion polls,\u202d \u202cwhich had SYRIZA winning by\u202d \u202c3%\u202d \u202cat most.\u202d \u202cNearly all polls had the election too close to call,\u202d \u202cwhile some had ND winning.\u202d \u202cNo one remotely predicted the size of the left coalition's win. \n \nAll the pre-election commentary was of a weakened SYRIZA or ND having to govern in coalition with some combination of the social-democratic Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement\u202d (\u202cPASOK\u202d) \u202cor The River,\u202d \u202cthe hipster party of cool urban professionals.\u202d \n \nYet the September\u202d \u202c20\u202d \u202cresult lets SYRIZA to repeat its governing alliance with the socially conservative right-nationalist Independent Greeks\u202d (\u202cANEL\u202d)\u202c. \n \nWithin SYRIZA confident predictions,\u202d \u202clike those of labour and social solidarity minister Giorgios Katrougalos,\u202d \u202chad looked very rash. \n \nKatrougalos had told the September\u202d \u202c17\u202d \u202cFrench weekly\u202d \u202c Politis\u202d \u202c:\u202d \u201c\u202cWe are going to win the elections.\u202d \u202cI am very optimistic because in Greece there are two political fronts.\u202d \n \n\u201cOne is the same as that of other peoples in Europe,\u202d \u202cof opposition to neoliberalism.\u202d \u202cThe other front,\u202d \u202cspecific to our country,\u202d \u202cpits us against the oligarchy and the system of political and economic corruption which ruled up to January\u202d \u202c25.\u202d \n \n\u201cI'm confident that our experience of a left government will not be stopped and that we will be given a second chance.\u202d\u201d \n \nThe most plausible explanation for the result is that SYRIZA's relentless warnings against the threat of an ND win induced people\u202d \u202c\u2014 especially the young\u202d \u202c\u2014 who were leaning towards abstention or a vote for other left parties to stick to the left coalition. \n \nPetros Markopoulos,\u202d \u202ca former member of SYRIZA youth's management committee who resigned after Tsipras agreed in July to the the creditors\u202d' \u202cbailout conditions of extreme austerity,\u202d \u202cexpressed this sentiment,\u202d \u202ctelling the September\u202d \u202c14\u202d <\u202ci>Financial Times\u202d<\u202c/i\u202d>\u202c:\u202d \u201c\u202cIf SYRIZA loses this election,\u202d \u202cthen we will see a total collapse of the left\u202d\u2026 \n \n\u201cSure,\u202d \u202cSYRIZA has not achieved the revolution we hoped.\u202d \u202cBut we have to do all we can to ensure they win now.\u202d \u202cThen the debate on our future can restart.\u202d\u201d \n \nLeft opposition \n \nThe two main victims of this pull on disappointed SYRIZA voters were the Communist Party of Greece\u202d (\u202cKKE\u202d) \u202cand Popular Unity\u202d (\u202cPU\u202d)\u202c,\u202d \u202cthe left split from SYRIZA of outright opponents of the July\u202d \u202c13\u202d \u202cmemorandum agreement led by former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis. \n \nAll but the very last polls gave PU between\u202d \u202c3%\u202d \u202cand\u202d \u202c4%,\u202d \u202cenough to get the new formation over the\u202d \u202c3%\u202d \u202cthreshold for parliamentary representation with between eight and\u202d \u202c13\u202d \u202cseats.\u202d \u202cYet the final result for PU,\u202d \u202cwhich accepts that Greece probably needs to leave the Eurozone,\u202d \u202cwas only\u202d \u202c2.86%,\u202d \u202cleaving it out of the parliament altogether.\u202d \n \nThis compares with the\u202d \u202c25\u202d \u202cseats previously held by MPs from SYRIZA's former Left Platform,\u202d \u202cwhich forms the core of of PU. \n \nThe KKE averaged\u202d \u202c6.4%\u202d \u202cin polling before September\u202d \u202c20,\u202d \u202cup from as the\u202d \u202c5.47%\u202d \u202cwon in January.\u202d \u202cYet its final score was only\u202d \u202c5.55%,\u202d \u202cleaving its representation in parliament unchanged at\u202d \u202c15\u202d \u202cseats. \n \nThe setback for non-SYRIZA left forces was compounded by the decision of Anti-Capitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow\u202d (\u202cANTARSYA\u202d) \u202cnot to join the PU ticket.\u202d \u202cIts own vote increased from\u202d \u202c0.64%\u202d \u202cto\u202d \u202c0.85%,\u202d \u202cbut if it had stood with PU on a joint ticket this would have passed the\u202d \u202c3%\u202d \u202cthreshold. \n \nThe decision of former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to sit out what he called a\u202d \u201c\u202csad\u202d\u201d \u202celection also weakened the position of the non-SYRIZA left.\u202d \n \nHis initial analysis,\u202d \u202cpublished in the September\u202d \u202c21\u202d <\u202ci>Guardian\u202d<\u202c/i\u202d>\u202c,\u202d \u202cstated:\u202d \u201c\u202cPopular Unity failed stunningly to

already vicious levels of austerity.\u202d \n \n\u201cPOTAMI\u202d [\u202cThe River\u202d]\u202c,\u202d \u202ca party positioning itself as the troika\u2019s reformist darling,\u202d \u202calso failed

\u202cThere were\u202d \u202c764,500\u202d \u202cextra abstentions at this election compared to January\u202d \u202c25. \n \nIn a country where voting is formally compulsory and\u202d \u202c9.84\u202d

neither-left-nor-right-but-little-people-first message could win support in the confusion produced by the imposition of the third memorandum. \n \nAll the other parties,\u202d \u202cincluding those

government\u202d \u202c\u2014 facing European Central Bank threats to turn off liquidity to Greece's insolvent banks\u202d \u202c\u2014 accepted the harsh conditions of the third bailout. \n \nIn the run-up to September\u202d \u202c20,\u202d \u202cmedia coverage on the mood among SYRIZA's most active supporters,\u202d \u202cespecially the young,\u202d \u202cstressed feelings of betrayal,\u202d \u202ctiredness and disgust with politics.\u202d \n \nNonetheless,\u202d \u202cdespite the rise in apathy,\u202d \u202cthe turmoil and membership loss within SYRIZA,\u202d \u202cpre-election polls showed the left coalition was maintaining the support of at least\u202d \u202c85%\u202d \u202cof those who had voted for it on January\u202d \u202c25. \n \nReasons \n \nThere are three basic reasons why.\u202d \u202cFirstly,\u202d \u202cthe government's six-month-long struggle to win an acceptable deal was seen by many as the best that could have been achieved in the face of the blackmail of the European Commission,\u202d \u202cEuropean Central Bank and International Monetary Fund\u202d (\u202cthe\u202d \u201c\u202cTroika\u202d\u201d)\u202c. \n \nThe argument that an alternative course was possible without sooner or later ending in\u202d \u201c\u202cGrexit\u202d\u201d \u202cseems not to have convinced many,\u202d \u202cif the vote won by PU and the KKE is an accurate indicator. \n \nSecondly,\u202d \u202cthe SYRIZA-led government at least started to implement some aspects of the\u202d \u201c\u202cSalonika Program\u202d\u201d \u202con which it was elected. \n \nThese measures included free electricity for more than\u202d \u202c200,000,\u202d \u202cfood vouchers for\u202d \u202c350,000,\u202d \u202can accommodation program with rent subsidy for\u202d \u202c30,000\u202d \u202cfamilies and cuts to various health care and hospital payments. \n \nThe government also provided tax and social security contribution relief for\u202d \u202c750,000\u202d \u202cindividuals and small businesses,\u202d \u202creopened public radio and television,\u202d \u202cand started to go after the big tax evaders. \n \nAccording to Leo Panitch,\u202d \u202cco-editor of the\u202d \u202c \u202cSocialist Register\u202d<\u202c/i\u202d>\u202c and a close observer of Greece:\u202d \u201c\u202cThe humanitarian stuff they introduced immediately in February,\u202d \u202cright after they were elected,\u202d \u202chas not been pulled back,\u202d \u202cand it's had an enormous impact on the people who are suffering the most.\u202d\u201d \u202d> \n \nThirdly,\u202d \u202cthe SYRIZA government is still regarded as the first honest administration in contemporary Greek history.\u202d \u202cDespite its defeat in the battle with\u202d \u201c\u202cBrussels\u202d\u201d\u202c,\u202d \u202cSYRIZA is still viewed as a break with traditionally corrupt Greek politics as represented by ND and PASOK. \n \nA secondary reason,\u202d \u202caccording to Channel\u202d \u202c4\u202d'\u202cs Paul Mason on September\u202d \u202c21,\u202d \u202cwas SYRIZA's policy of closing refugee detention centres and helping refugees to move through Greece to destinations in northern Europe:\u202d \u201c\u202cI got the a sense last night\u202d [\u202cat a dinner with some SYRIZA voters\u202d] \u202cthat even people disgusted with the party's climb-down over austerity voted left because they wanted to avoid the conservatives taking charge of Europe's front line.\u202d \n \n\u201cAny return to tight border policing,\u202d \u202cround-ups and preventing migrants from moving out of Greece would have plunged this country into immediate chaos.\u202d\u201d \n \n[Dick Nichols is\u202d <\u202ci>Green Left Weekly\u202d<\u202c/i\u202d>'\u202cs European correspondent,\u202d \u202cbased in Barcelona.\u202d
