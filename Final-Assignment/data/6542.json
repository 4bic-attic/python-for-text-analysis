(Genesis 3:15) This is the first promise of the remarkable salvation that would bridge the gap between sinful man and a gracious God. From the beginning of creation, God had a redemptive plan that would begin and end with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, the promised Seed, entered the world with the purpose of bruising the head of Satan (Romans 16:20) and claiming God's children to be His own. Thus, Christ destroyed the power of the evil one and freed mankind from the tremendous bondage of sin. From this, His grace flows forth and draws us as believers to His side.", "source": "To His Glory"}
