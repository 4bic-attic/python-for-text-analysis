Which is on time. I\u2019m always on time.\u201d \n\nHe straightened his green tie. A Catholic, Boehner explained that he chose it because it was the color of the church\u2019s current liturgical season. \n\nAnd then it was show time. \n\nFrancis walked in quietly and without fanfare. Two Cardinals and five Monsignors of the church slipped in quietly behind him. \n\nThe two powerful men \u2013 politician and priest \u2013 clasped hands for several smiling moments before taking their seats. \n\n\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d Boehner said. \n\nAnd, for the Ohio Republican, one a long time in coming. \n\nRaised in a devoutly Catholic home \u2013 where portraits of both President John F. Kennedy and the Pope hung on the Boehner family\u2019s wall \u2013 the Speaker told The Cincinnati Enquirer this week that he grew up saying a prayer for the pope and archbishop every day. \n\nAnd once he was elected to Congress, and then House leadership, he began inviting the Pope \u2013 first John Paul II, then Benedict \u2013 to Capitol Hill. After 20 years of trying, Francis was the first to accept. \n\n\u201cFor a little Catholic boy like me, this is big stuff,\u201d he told the Enquirer. \n\nHe presented the Pope with a silver pitcher engraved with the date and the Speaker\u2019s seal, and nestled \u2013 with a small notecard \u2013 in Royal blue satin. Giving PEOPLE a sneak peek at the gift, a spokeswoman for Boehner declined to inspect the note, saying \u201cI kinda don\u2019t want to open it because it could be personal.\u201d \n\nThe historic, unprecedented papal address to Congress is, in fact, such a personal big deal to Boehner that he was taking no chances on his congressional colleagues ruining it. \n\nAnd \u201chundreds of meetings, more than we\u2019ve ever had for any other event,\u201d as one congressional aide described the months of advance planning for this visit, left nothing to chance. \n\nMembers had been warned that protocol \u2013 and the need to keep Francis on schedule \u2013 dictates that they not hold him up with handshakes and hellos. \n\nClick here to read full story \u00bb", "source": "997WTN.com"}
