Some years you get a good percentage of lambs, and other years you get a lower percentage, and you send off to the works depending on how productive the season's been,\" Clement said. \n \n\"Fishing's no different.\" \n \nSealord owns 30 per cent of the hoki quota and buys in extra from others to top up its catch. \n \nFishing general manager Doug Paulin said the cut wouldn't have any effect on Sealord's business. \n \n\"We catch more hoki than we actually own so it just means there's less that we have to purchase during the year.\" \n \n\"We've had a tremendous hoki season. We planned to catch 53,500 tonnes and we're actually going to catch closer to 58,000.\" \n \nPaulin said countries like New Zealand that managed their fisheries well and in a precautionary manner had to expect \"both lifts and cuts\" based on stock recruitment and what the surveys showed.\u00a0 \n \nMeanwhile, Clement said the seafood industry needed time to consider the implications of the Government's announcement that it is creating a marine sanctuary twice as large as New Zealand around the Kermadec Islands.\u00a0 \n    \nThere had not been any forewarning, Clement said.\u00a0 \n \nThe decision would exclude New Zealand longlining and trolling companies catching tuna under sustainable quotas. \n \n\"We look forward to the Government's compassionate treatment of those New Zealand families\u00a0 \n \nwhose livelihoods will be impacted,\" he said.\u00a0 \n  \n\u00a0", "source": "Marlborough Express"}
