When there's a fallen officer, doesn't matter where, we want to pay tribute to\u00a0that officer,\" said Det. Lisa King \n \nThe 460-kilometre\u00a0relay wrapped up at Parliament Hill Saturday afternoon. \n  \nOne of the officers being remembered Sunday is Const. David Wynn. He was shot in the head during a routine license checking operation in January. (RCMP ) \n  \nOn Sunday officers will gather for a memorial service for\u00a0 Edmonton Police Const. Daniel Woodall , Alberta RCMP Const.\u00a0David Wynn , commercial transport enforcement officer Toni Kristinsson of British Columbia\u00a0and Manitoba correctional officer Rhonda Commodore. \n \nAmong those in the crowd will be\u00a0 Erin\u00a0Ochakovsky, who lost her husband in 2010. He was a constable with the Peel Regional Police. \n \n\"We have given the ultimate sacrifice, the survivors live the ultimate\u00a0sacrifice,\" she said. \n \nOchakovsky\u00a0says the ceremony helps\u00a0families of the deceased officers cope with their loss. \n \n\"It lets you know that you're still a part of the police family. They have each other's backs and they have\u00a0the family's back, whether the officer is deceased or not. \" \n \nThe memorial service begins on Parliament Hill at 11 a.m. ET.", "source": "CBC"}
