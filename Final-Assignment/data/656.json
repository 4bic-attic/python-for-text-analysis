The DAP left PR in Sarawak in March this year as a sign of protest against PAS\u2019s hudud push in Kelantan. \n \nBut Kedit said even without the DAP, Sarawak PR was very much \u201calive and kicking\u201d with its remaining members from PKR and PAS. \n \nOn the national level, PR dissolved shortly after the PAS muktamar in June this year when the Islamist party resolved to sever all ties with the DAP. \n \nDAP, PKR and PAS contested in the 2011 Sarawak elections under the state PR platform, which allowed the opposition parties to avoid multi-cornered fights in the state\u2019s 71 seats. \n \nThe next Sarawak polls will be held by next year.", "source": "Malay Mail"}
