I don't see the reason why there should be this anxiety on the nuclear build programme,\" Nene said on Talk Radio 702. \n\nAnalysts estimate the project will cost as much as $100 billion and there has been mounting concern among opposition parties about the cost and that agreements to build the nuclear plants will be made behind closed doors, without the necessary public scrutiny. \n\n\"As we look at the energy mix, affordability is going to be an issue, its for that reason I think the nation should await the budgeting process, we can't budget in public as people expect,\" Nene said. \n\nChina, France, Russia, the United States, South Korea, Japan and Canada have all expressed interest. \n\nInter-governmental agreements (IGAs) have been signed or are close to signing but opposition lawmakers have said the wording of these differ significantly and seem to favour Russia. \n\nAn energy advisor to the government said in June that South Africa was considering using reactors from Russia's Rosatom and Westinghouse of the United States for its nuclear fleet expansion. \n\n- Reuters", "source": "Times Live South Africa"}
