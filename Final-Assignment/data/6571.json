Long-time family friend of Day, Colin Swatton has guided the golfer to five tour titles this year, culminating in the 27-year-old claiming the world number one rank this week after winning the BMW Championship.\n\nCashing his percentage of Day\u2019s winner\u2019s cheques along the way, the caddie\u2019s salary is now equal to and in some cases greater than some of Australia\u2019s most high profile athletes. Jason Day takes his putter from caddie Colin Swatton on the ninth hole during the Final Round of the BMW Championship. Source:  Swatton has earned approximately $1.28 million in 2015, not including bonuses. That\u2019s more than top Australian pro golfer Karrie Webb made last year, but Swatton never swung a club. According to , AFL star Gary Ablett Jnr and rugby hero Israel Folau are the only footy code stars to earn more than Swatton, with a reported salary of $1.5 million each.\n\nMeanwhile, NRL big names Greg Inglis ($850,000) and Jonathan Thurston ($900,000) don\u2019t even come close to Swatton\u2019s pay cheque this year.\n\nTaking big hits every week, or carrying the bag for the best golfer in the world?\n\nSwatton has certainly found himself in an enviable position.", "source": "FoxSports.com.au"}
