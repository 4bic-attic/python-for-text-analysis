And we will continue to do so,\u201d Spain\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda said Friday. \n \nA victory would give Mas a mandate to negotiate Catalonia\u2019s independence with the Spanish government, the EU and other international organizations, he argues. In a 2014 referendum on independence \u2014 which Spain\u2019s constitutional court ruled illegal, making it non-binding \u2014 about 80 percent voted in favor of breaking with Spain. \n \nTo pursue his dream of independence, Mas will need an absolute majority of 68 seats in the Catalan parliament, which has 135 seats in total. Latest polls predict a close race, with the pro-independence \u00a0Junts pel s\u00ed\u00a0 (Together for a Yes) \u00a0 a hair\u2019s breadth from their goal\u00a0with 65-67 seats, according to surveys by\u00a0 Metroscopia and El Mundo . \n \nBut Mas, who merged his\u00a0Democratic Convergence of Catalonia with the like-minded Republican Left of Catalonia, Democrats of Catalonia (DC) and Left Movement (MES) to form Junts pel s\u00ed in July, has the option of forming a coalition with the left-wing CUP party, which is also in favor of independence and is projected to win between 9 and 11 seats. \n \nRajoy has based his party\u2019s referendum campaign on fomenting fears about the future of the region without Spain, arguing for example that an independent Catalonia could not stay in the EU. \n \n\u201cWhat would happen with the pensions, with the financial entities, the bank deposits, the money?\u201d he said in a radio interview \u00a0Tuesday, warning of the risk of instability. \n \nOn Thursday, his minister for agriculture Isabel Garc\u00eda Tejerina upped the ante by saying an independent Catalonia would lose \u20ac430 million per year in EU subsidies. \n Viable state  \nThe crucial question for the Catalans is whether an independent Catalonia could remain in the euro, and whether it could become the European Union\u2019s 29th member state. \n \nA few days ahead of the vote, these questions caused confusion at the European Commission. \n \nAnswering a written question if a declaration of independence would be recognized by Brussels, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker answered \u00a0with a \u201cno comment\u201d in English \u2014 but issued a Spanish text which said: \u201cThe determination of a member state\u2019s territory can only be appointed by national constitutional law and not the decision of an autonomous parliament.\u201d \n \nThe Commission later described this inconsistency as a \u201chuman error\u201d and said only the English-language text counted. The Catalan government has\u00a0 demanded an investigations into what it called a case of \u201calleged manipulation.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe have a viable economy and we are a regular contributor to EU funds\u201d \u2013 Amadeu Altafaj, Catalan representative to the EU. \n \nBarcelona argues that it fulfils all the criteria for EU membership. \n \n\u201cWe have a viable economy, with 112 percent of the EU\u2019s average economic output, and we are a regular contributor to EU funds,\u201d\u00a0Amadeu Altafaj, the Catalan government\u2019s permanent representative to the EU, said to POLITICO. \n \nThe autonomous government published a white paper last year, describing a possible path for the transition to an independent state. It would be \u201cfully committed to the European values,\u201d\u00a0Altafaj said, and engage in responsibilities like refugee relocation. \n \n\u201cWe need to sit down with the Spanish government and the European institutions to talk and negotiate,\u201d Mas said earlier this month. \n \nWhile Rajoy repeatedly calls an independence \u201cimpossible,\u201d Mas\u2019 government hopes to see him vacate his job in Madrid soon. \n \nIn December, Spain holds national elections, and the signs are not good for the main established parties. In regional and communal elections across much of Spain in May,\u00a0Rajoy\u2019s conservative Partido Popular and the main opposition Socialist Worker\u2019s Party both lost a huge share of the vote . \n \nTwo newcomers, the left-wing Podemos and the center-right Ciudadanos, are on the rise. Although both parties want to avoid Spain splitting up, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has said he recognizes Catalonia\u2019s right to self-determination. \n \n\u201cWe hope that the next government will engage in constructive discussions, but we also expect more mobilization on the European level,\u201d Altafaj said. \u201cOur aim is to complete the independence process within the next 18 months.\u201d \n  This story tagged under", "source": "Politico.eu"}
