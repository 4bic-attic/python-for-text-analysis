Their average age was 75, and roughly half had some degree of cognitive impairment at the start of the study. They were from a variety of ethnic groups. \nThe Impact of Low Vitamin D: \nThe scientists also measured blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a measure of vitamin D status in the body. Roughly 25 percent of the subjects in the study were deficient in vitamin D, meaning that their levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were below 12 ng/mL. \n\nMore than half of the volunteers had\u00a0low vitamin D levels. The lower the levels of vitamin D, the greater the decline in both memory and cognitive function over the five-year assessment period. \nThe Take-Home Message: \nThe authors conclude that low vitamin D levels may correspond to an elevated risk for dementia. Since so many seniors stay out of the sun and have low vitamin D levels, this is a significant concern. \n\nWhat is unknown, however, is whether taking vitamin D supplements could prevent or slow mental decline. Anyone who decides to try supplements should be sure to take vitamin D3\u00a0along with a meal that contains a certain amount of fat.
