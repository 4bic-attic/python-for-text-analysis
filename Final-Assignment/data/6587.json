It asks a question that is concerned actually with the lack of honesty and transparency in the present UCO administration.\n\"David:\u00a0 I have been looking for the video of the Officers meeting which took place Thursday, August 27th, 2015.\u00a0 Where is it?\u00a0 Do you not want the people of CV to see what was discussed, what is happening at these meetings?\u00a0 I think it is important that people hear what is being said, see what committee members are actually attending these meetings and what is happening here in the village with WPRF and all of our other committee meetings. All meetings should be on your blog and on Channel 63.\" Marilyn Pomerantz Should be interesting to see if he even bothers to answer to this posted question on his private blog", "source": "My Village Blogger"}
