But their efforts were unsuccessful. \n\nThe Zorbaughs died of smoke inhalation and burns, the coroner's office announced on Monday. \n\nMichaels said Anthony Zorbaugh had \"significant health issues\" and had trouble moving around. It appeared that Connie Zorbuagh had been trying to help him get out, the chief said. \n\nThe house is not a total loss, but damage is estimated at $45,000, the chief said. \n\n\u2014 Reach Greg Gross at ggross@yorkdispatch.com . \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n\u00a92015 The York Dispatch (York, Pa.) \n\nVisit The York Dispatch (York, Pa.) at www.yorkdispatch.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\n_____ \n\nTopics: t000037113,t000040408,t0001981", "source": "Lancaster Online"}
