Not only does it turn me on it has evoked some new ideas in my head. We all know I'm all for having fun, trying new things, and making money. That said this blog has my head going places I only timidly visited in the past. I have been binge reading since I went to work last night and his posts just keep getting more interesting. Who knows. Maybe a change of career is something I should consider.
