We wanted to share three big takeaways from our meeting and look at how Roberts plans to run a \u201cworld class audit shop.\u201d\n\n1. More Transparency, Less Arm-Twisting\n\nAt her inauguration in January, Roberts promised to be an \u201cauditor for all of Oakland,\u201d for renters and homeowners, taxpayers and small businesses. To reach this goal, her office is not just following the money, but promoting collaboration and transparency citywide.\n\nRoberts is more process than outcome focused when it comes to promoting strong finances. Basically, she says, it doesn\u2019t help to find out at the end of a project that it\u2019s gone over-budget, to do a postmortem for the city. \u201cWhen it\u2019s already in the headlines, what do you want me to report?\u201d\n\nBut Roberts sees more and more departments reaching out first, opening lines of communication, and opening their books for review. This a good sign. It shows the auditor\u2019s office is starting to build trust and inspire teamwork. \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Can you come and look at my department?\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s exactly what I want to hear.\u201d\n\nThis allows her office to do more consulting and less arm-twisting. They\u2019re able to set milestones, track change orders, run user-acceptance tests, and overall make the evaluation process much more rigorous.\n\n2. A Risk-Focused Oakland\n\n As City Auditor, Roberts says she is focusing on Oakland\u2019s greatest risks - risks to the city\u2019s budget and image, to health and safety. Part of this approach is about raising awareness in the community about fraud, waste and abuse, and managing a hotline for new reports. \n\nIt\u2019s also about being the best watchdog and breaking up Oakland\u2019s \u201cculture of interference.\u201d This is a wide-ranging effort: The City Auditor\u2019s office is looking at noncompliances, creating business continuity plans, examining hiring and retention practices - including on the job training, talent acquisition, vacancies, technology or skillset deficiencies - and much more.\n\nFrom all this, Roberts is trying to create a \u201cheat map\u201d of risk. Her office has especially focused on getting resources to decentralized departments, what she calls a \u201cfurther from the mothership\u201d approach.\n\nShe\u2019s also focused on who the city partners with - contractors, service providers, and nonprofits - groups she feels are more likely for budget burnout or fraud. \u00a0It\u2019s necessary to keep these partners on a \u201cshort, tight rein,\u201d she said.\n\nRoberts is pushing for smarter, stronger internal controls where her office is seeing a general lack of procedures and policy. In this year\u2019s police overtime audit, for example, they exposed a need for more effective overtime and comp time management and more realistic OPD budgets.\n\n3. Oakland Needs a Time Audit\n\nThe City Auditor's risk-based approach is almost a necessity, brought on by her office\u2019s lack of resources. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s no time to say \u2018nice job,\u2019\u201d Roberts said.\n\nRoberts heads a 10-person staff with about a $1.5 million budget--that\u2019s a few people and thousands of dollars too short. There are some short-term solutions to make up the difference like getting grants for interns and fellows. There are also policy changes to consider like setting a portion of every department's budget aside for the auditor\u2019s office.\n\nRight now, they\u2019re preparing a handful of mandatory audits including audits for Measure M and N, an audit of 911 services, \u00a0and an audit of the Oakland Fire Department\u2019s wildfire prevention measures.\n\nRoberts notes that these rolling audits sometimes feel \u201cunfocused,\u201d tying up her office, and at their worst risk becoming a waste of energy. She would rather see audit policy more in line with her process-based approach, more open than after-the-fact. (Of course removing a ballot-measure approved mandate requires another ballot measure.)\n\n\nMOBN would like to thank City Auditor Brenda Roberts for her time and her work at City Hall. We look forward to following her progress.", "source": "OakTalk"}
