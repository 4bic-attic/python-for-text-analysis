Some are unsung heroes. Others are selfless advocates. All are fueled by passion. \n\nThis list has 10 people and organizations. But I could rattle off 10 times that many. Literally. After I took to social media to ask readers for their suggestions for unsung heroes, I received more than 100. \n\nThat alone speaks volumes about the community. \n\n\u2022 Andrea Eliscu , mentor and philanthropist. When Eliscu lost her husband to cancer 15 years ago, she had every reason to retreat from the world. Instead, she embraced it: helping underprivileged kids, women with cancer, aspiring medical students and more. Eliscu's most creative endeavor is probably her dragon-boat project, in which kids from Parramore team up with Orlando cops in rowing competitions, learning to row and work together. That effort alone was profiled recently on NBC's \"Today\" show. But she has also helped cancer survivors and helped fund a scholarship for the inaugural class of UCF med-school students \u2026 in her husband's honor. \n \n\u2022 David Odahowski and the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation. It's hard to overstate the impact this foundation has on our community. We are talking donations of more than $100 million to more than 800 organizations \u2014 bolstering art and culture, promoting education, helping the destitute and more. The CEO, Odahowski, and his foundation do much of their work quietly but with widespread, impressive results. \n\n\u2022 Judy Sarullo of Pet Rescue by Judy. A lot of people have a passion for animals. Few turn that passion into a lifetime pursuit. More than 20 years ago, Judy started her crusade to find homes for unwanted animals in Seminole County. Since then, she has helped place pets all over Central Florida \u2014 a whopping 60,000 of them \u2014 which is why the Sentinel once described Judy as \"patron saint of abandoned, abused and unwanted dogs and cats.\" \n  \n\u2022 Virtually every public defender. They are overworked, outmanned and underpaid. They are scoffed at by some of their rotten clients. They don't get the time they need to work on cases that truly need it, and yet they can be someone's only hope for justice. Their profession is both noble and inglorious. Frontline prosecutors are in similar boats. The balance of justice often rests with people who aren't making enough money to pay off their law-school loans. \n\n\u2022 The Rev. Bill Barnes . Barnes retired this year as senior pastor of St. Luke's United Methodist Church But he leaves behind a legacy that has both changed \u2014 and saved \u2014 lives. Barnes believed that no one should suffer because of a lack of health care. That belief led him to found Shepherd's Hope Ministries, which now provides 21,000 free patient visits each year in clinics throughout Orange and Seminole counties. The reins here have recently been taken over by CEO Marni Stahlman , who will carry on the legacy \u2014 which includes an impressive 1,800 volunteers. \n \n\u2022 Michelle Mangum , director of Seminole Work Opportunity Program for special-needs adults. Michelle's offices are anything but glamorous. They're housed in an old warehouse with a crumbling second floor in a remote part of Seminole County. But there, she presides over a haven and refuge. At SWOP, developmentally disabled adults get a chance to have a job and earn dignity \u2014 at the only facility of its kind in Central Florida. Mangum could make more money elsewhere, but it's hard to imagine she could make more of a difference. \n\n\u2022 Joy Wallace Dickinson . Yes, the Sentinel's Joy Wallace Dickinson. Loudmouth columnists such as I may generate more mail. But week in and week out, Joy provides a service like no one else in Central Florida: sharing the stories of Central Florida's history in her weekend \"Florida Flashback\" column. History is important in any community. But history- tellers are particularly important in a transient community such as ours. Joy continues to fill that role even after retiring from her full-time days here \u2026 and we should all be grateful for that. \n\n\u2022 Bob Kodzis , professional inspirer. I first profiled Bob, a leadership and team-building consultant, a few years back when he began his new life-work model of donating half of all his services to local charities. (The title of the piece: \"He works one volunteer job for every paying one \u2014 and is richer for it.\") Well, it's been three years. And Bob's \"buy one, give one\" lifestyle is still going strong, benefiting nonprofits throughout the region. \n\n\u2022 Lizette Valarino , fulfiller of college dreams. Many students can get accepted to college if they work hard enough. Not everyone can afford to go, though. That was the problem Valarino wanted to solve when she founded the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Fund. Since she did so in 2000, the fund has provided scholarships to more than 200 students in Central Florida, transforming a whole lot of lives. \n\n\u2022 Donna Dowless , \"Ambassador of Love\" for the city of Orlando. Sure, the title \u2014 bestowed upon her by Mayor Buddy Dyer \u2014 may sound silly \u2026 until you meet Dowless and realize how genuine she is about promoting the upside of the City Beautiful. Dowless is a downtown artist with hip glasses and a cool coif who promotes and embraces all things Orlando and artistic. She's everywhere and all positive, all the time. There's a reason most of her artwork involves hearts. \n\nI have many more winning names to take \u2014 including Dr. Marvin Hardy , singer Mr. Richard , the leadership of Orange County's Legal Aid Society and more. \n\nTo learn more \u2014 or nominate unsung heroes of your own \u2014 visit OrlandoSentinel.com/takingnames . \n\nsmaxwell@tribpub.com \n Copyright \u00a9 2015, Orlando Sentinel", "source": "Orlando Sentinel"}
