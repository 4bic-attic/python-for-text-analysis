Early detection of prostate cancer saves lives, which is why I'm partnering with Winthrop Urology to provide free prostate cancer screening.\" Hannon and Winthrop Urology will be holding a FREE Prostate Screening on Thursday, September 24th, at Winthrop Urology (1300 Franklin Avenue, Suite ML-6, Garden City) from 3 - 7 pm. Registrations are required and appointments can be made by calling Senator Hannon's Community Office at 516-739-1700. Screenings will include a PSA blood test and a digital rectal exam (optional). \"September is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month,\" said Hannon. \"So now is a perfect time to schedule a free screening -- if caught early, prostate cancer can be very treatable. It's extremely important for men to be tested, as early as the age of 40.\" Return to top", "source": "Garden City News"}
