After decades of high-volume patenting at no small cost, today\u2019s tougher economic environment has forced many Japanese rights holders to consider partaking in activities \u2013 such as selling patents and partnering with NPEs \u00a0in order\u00a0to license their portfolios \u2013 that are traditionally frowned on. Even today, a significant cross-section of the country's corporate IP leaders see such activities as \u2018trolling\u2019 or, at the very least, as encouraging \u2018troll\u2019-like behaviour. That remains a key debate and one that will be a topic\u00a0at the forthcoming IPBC Asia in Tokyo this November. \n \nSeldom, though, these days\u00a0do we think about the other side of the equation; that is, of Japanese corporates being big-time acquirers of third-party patent portfolios. Of course, there is always going to be the odd deal here and there, but in a world where portfolio trimmimg is the name of the game, purchasing assets is not high on most corporate to-do lists. There is, though, one exception. In a time of retrenchment, one big Japanese company seems ot be bucking the trend by being very lively on the buy side\u00a0over the past few years. \n \nIn fact, Tokyo-based internet and e-commerce player Rakuten was the 13 th most active buyer of US patents globally between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Allied Security Trust that was published in issue 69 of IAM late last year. Over that time, it participated in 27 transactions, acquiring a total of 659 US patent assets. This put it just ahead of Microsoft, which conducted 23 transactions to acquire 538 patents during the same period. \n \nRakuten \u2013 whose name means \u2018optimism\u2019 in Japanese \u2013 was founded in 1997, but its major expansion internationally began in earnest in the late 2000s. In addition to purchasing patent portfolios in order to strengthen its market position and operational freedom, Rakuten has also been highly active in M&A deals and venture investments, which have further contributed to its overall IP holdings. It has also been busy in terms of organic IP growth with its own intensive R&D and patent filing efforts. \n \nUsing data from the ktMINE \u00a0database, I have put together the below table to give an overview of Rakuten\u2019s main sources of intellectual property as it has gone about its patent buying spree since 2010. The table lists patent assignments from third-party organisations that involve more than one asset being transacted, so it does not necessarily take into account patents that have been obtained through M&A activity. The leading vendor of patents to Rakuten is compatriot JVC Kenwood; while a number of other Japanese electronics companies also feature prominently. \n Assignor \r Industry \r Country \r Total US patent assets assigned to date \r Details \r JVC Kenwood \r Consumer electronics \r Japan \r 198 \r Most recent assignment of 11 assets in July 2015. \r NEC \r Information technology \r Japan \r 109 \r Most recent assignment of 10 assets in May 2015. \r IBM \r Information technology \r United States \r 107 \r Most recent assignment of 69 assets in March 2015. \r Global D \r IP service provider \r Japan \r 100 \r Global D is a Tokyo-based intermediary and consultancy firm.\u00a0 \r Sharp \r Consumer electronics \r Japan \r 44 \r Single recorded assignment in September 2013. \r AT&T \r Telecommunications \r United States \r 35 \r Has made assignments to Rakuten under a variety of entities.
