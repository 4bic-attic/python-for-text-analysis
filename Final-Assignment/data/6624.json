Head coach Bill O'Brien wants to go with the more physically gifted of his quarterbacks. The Brian Hoyer experiment lasted just a few quarters. Last week in relief of Hoyer, Mallett went 8-of-14 for 98 yards and a touchdown. Mallett is more of a question mark but also has much more upside. Fantasy Analysis:\nHoyer definitely wasn't worth having on your roster. However, Mallett may be worth a stash. We really don't know how he's going to be. Nonetheless, he has a very good arm and has DeAndre Hopkins in his back pocket. Arian Foster should be returning soon as well. That's a lot of talent for him to work with and O'Brien is an excellent coach. Mallett could fall flat but don't just write him off.", "source": "Fantasy Football Toolbox Updates"}
