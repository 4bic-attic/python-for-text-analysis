(WTNH) \u2014 The thought of his homeland, Syria, ravaged by the terrors of an ongoing civil war is enough to bring Ramez Aldarwish to tears. \n \n\u201cPeople are suffering in Syria, especially the children,\u201d Aldarwish said. \n \nHe\u2019s one of the fortunate ones who escaped to the United States with his wife and two young children. \n \n\u201cAll Syrians are my sisters and brothers and overall situation not good at all,\u201d Aldarwish said through an interpreter. \n \nFrom the safety of New Haven, Ramez told his story. He\u2019s from Homs. Once the third-largest city in Syria, before the Arab Spring started nearly five years ago and protestors rose up in defiance against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n\u201cThe protesters went out on the streets and requested freedom. The government was just shooting them,\u201d Ramez said. \u201cThe government was just shooting them, the protesters.\u201d \n \nIn 2012, Ramez escaped with his family to a refugee camp in Jordan, where they remained for nearly three years. His home, like much of the city, was obliterated. With the help of Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, the family made it to Connecticut in August after passing a security check. \n \n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to assimilate and become members of Connecticut community as soon as possible,\u201d said Kate Wood, a case manager with IRIS. \n \nIRIS is a group partially funded by the State-Department, and based in New Haven, responsible for the care of refugees fleeing from war or persecution. Ramez had a steady job with good pay in Syria. Now here in New Haven, he\u2019s struggling to find work because of the language barrier. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging. Learning English quick to get a job is challenging,\u201d Wood said. \u201cTo get a job have to start from lower level and work up.\u201d \n \nBut Ramez is willing to work hard, and said he is more than grateful to have landed in Connecticut. \n \n\u201cAmerica is a very beautiful country,\u201d Aldarwish said. \u201cConnecticut is so beautiful.\u201d \n   [embedded content]   \nAdvertisement", "source": "WTHI"}
