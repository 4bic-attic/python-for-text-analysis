Another 19 passengers, including 18 men and one woman, have been rescued. \n\nThe 12.2 meter (40 foot) boat was traveling from Kuala Sungai Bernam, off the west coast of Malaysia to Tanjong Balai, Indonesia when it capsized about nine nautical miles south-west of Tanjong Sauh in the Malacca Straight, the MMEA said. \n\nLocal fisherman were the first on the scene and rescued 14 people before contacting the MMEA, which then deployed ships and an airplane in a search and rescue operation. \n\nThe search was suspended on Thursday night, but local district police chief, ACP Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain, said efforts would continue on Friday. \n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak offered his condolences on Twitter to the families of those who died. \n\n\"The boat capsize in Sabak Bernam is a sad incident. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) will continue with the search and rescue operation. Al -Fatihah and my condolences to the families of passengers who were killed,\" he tweeted, according to an English translation from Malaysian state media. \n\nThe MMEA said the boat had most likely sunk due to overcrowding or bad weather, although further investigation was needed to determine the details of the sinking and the exact number of people who had been on board the boat.", "source": "KEYT3"}
