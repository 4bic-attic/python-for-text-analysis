We start spring pretty stormy, but some good rain to start the season.\" \n Weather warnings in place  \nA heavy rain warning is in force for Waikato, the Kaimai Range and Bay of Plenty west of Matata, and Nelson west of Motueka. \n \nA severe gale warning is in force for Nelson west of Motueka, Buller and northern Westland. \n \nThis watch is for the possibility of rainfall accumulations reaching warning amounts in: \n \nCoromandel Peninsula and Mt Taranaki: \n \nUntil early afternoon (Tuesday). \n \nBay of Plenty east of Matata, Taupo, Northern Gisborne, also the ranges of Hawkes Bay. \n \nUntil late afternoon or early evening. \n \nMarlborough and the remained of Nelson: \n \nUntil early this evening. \n \nNorth Otago and Dunedin: \n \nA period of heavy easterly rain from mid-afternoon until tonight. \n \nWestland: \n \nFrom tonight until early Wednesday afternoon. \n \nWaikato, Waitomo, Taumaranui and Taranaki: \n \nUntil about midday today. \n \nTaihape, Wanganui, Manawatu, Horowhenua and Kapiti Coast: \n \nUntil early afternoon (Tuesday). \n \nThe Marlborough Sounds and Nelson east of Motueka: \n \nEast to southeast gales until early afternoon. \n \n3 News", "source": "3 News"}
