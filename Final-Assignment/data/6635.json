Under Salary Grade 11, they receive only P18,549. \n \nAccording to Ang Nars Rep. Leah Paquiz, the group was forced to seek the high tribunal\u2019s help after their appeal was rejected by the DBM, the Department of Health (DOH), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). \n \nShe said the DBM directive relegating nurses to Salary Grade 11 was illegal as it clearly runs counter to RA 9173. \n \nThe additional P6,000 to P7,000 under Salary Grade 15 would definitely mean a lot to nurses as they could use it to pay for their food or children\u2019s education, she said, and added that the least the government could do to recognize the hard work of its nursing workforce is to pay them the correct amount.", "source": "Kicker Daily News"}
