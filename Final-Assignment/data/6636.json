I also have a Facebook account that is configured on the iPhone. \n \nThe steps I went through: \n \n1. Scan documents by taking pictures with iPhone \n \n\u00a0 \n \n2. Open the Camera Roll. If you want to share with an Apple Device (iPad, Mac) you can use the Photo Stream option that allows access to pictures directly on iCloud) \n \nTo share with with other devices, email and Facebook are options \u2013 as is of course connecting the iPhone to a USB port. For the first two options: \n \nSelect images on iPhone (in Edit Mode in Camera Roll) \u2013 Click on Share \n \n\n \nand Share with Facebook \n \n\n \n(this requires the Facebook account to have been configured on the iPhone) \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \nNote: when there are five or fewer than you can also email them from the Share option) \n \n\u00a0 \n \n3. Open your Facebook account \n \n\n \nNote: to prepare for this step, I first installed Firefox Addon Facedown by Achim Wehmann \u2013 see https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facedown/ ) \n \nClick on Albums. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nRight Click on the Album with the desired pictures (quite possibly called iOS Photos). The context menu should contain the option Download Facebook Album. \n \n\n \nClick this item and select the target folder into which the image files will be downloaded. \n \n\n \nDownload takes place, very rapidly: \n \n\n \n4. Copy the files to the NAS mapped network drive \n \nThe post To quickly transfer scanned documents and pictures from the iPhone to PC and USB stick appeared first on AMIS Oracle and Java Blog .", "source": "AMIS Oracle and Java Blog"}
