It\u2019s too cold and everything is dirty, and it smells bad,\u201d said a young man from Damascus. \n \nA Hungarian TV camerawoman was fired Tuesday after footage appeared to show her kicking migrants, including children, as they ran away from a police line during disturbances at Roszke. \n \nJuncker urged EU interior ministers, who are meeting next Monday, to back his new plan for the relocation of 120,000 refugees in Hungary, Greece, and Italy, and a plan first floated in May to relocate 40,000 others in Italy and Greece. \n \n\u201cIt is 160,000 that Europe has to take into their arms, this has to be done in a compulsory way,\u201d said Juncker. \n \nUnder the EU plan, Germany would take more than 31,000 migrants, France 24,000 and Spain almost 15,000. \n \nFrance has already agreed to take that number, while Britain has said it would take 20,000 over five years, although they would come from refugee camps on the Syrian border and not other EU states. \n \nEU president Donald Tusk warned Monday of an \u201cexodus\u201d that would likely last \u201cfor many years.\u201d \n \nOn the Greek holiday island of Lesbos, where around 20,000 people have been waiting in squalid conditions to travel to the mainland, a new processing center was set up on Monday which processed some 14,000 people in just over 24 hours. \n \nTensions were also high on other Aegean islands where another 10,000 are stuck waiting to reach the mainland. \n \n\u201cIt was horrible the last three days . . . There are no rooms, no hotels, no bathrooms, no beds, no anything,\u201d said Hussam Hamzat, a 27-year-old engineer from Damascus who finally got his departure papers on Tuesday after an overnight wait. \n \nMore than 380,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea this year, figures from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR showed Tuesday, including close to 260,000 in Greece and 121,000 in Italy. \n \nSome 85 percent of those coming to Europe are refugees because they have fled war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the agency says. \n \nThe U.N.\u2019s special representative for migration and development, Peter Sutherland, on Monday called for a global asylum effort, proposing an international conference \u201cwhere every country is held up to the spotlight.\u201d \n \nAs Australia agreed to up its quota, offers of help also came in from south America, with Venezuela saying it would accept 20,000, Brazil declaring migrants would be welcomed with \u201copen arms\u201d and Chile also pledging to take \u201ca large number.\u201d \n \nCanada\u2019s Quebec province has also said it will take 3,650 this year and Washington has said it is examining how it could provide more help.", "source": "Japan Times"}
