PAUL, Minn., Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ergotron, a subsidiary of Nortek, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTK), today launches new style-driven brand ErgotronHome. As part of the company's consumer business unit, and to continue to advance Ergotron's JustStand.org healthy movement initiative, ErgotronHome is making its debut with the Workspace\u2122 collection. The series includes four sit-stand and home-tech organization products that bring adjustability and healthier movement into everyday activities, especially home technology use. \"We know people are using technology at home but not always in the most comfortable, healthy or productive ways. In part it's due to a lack of stylish and customizable solutions that meet modern demands,\" said David Wardleworth, president of ErgotronHome. \"ErgotronHome is responding with products that look great and have important performance benefits. Utilizing Ergotron's supreme ergonomics expertise, the products are a natural fit for the home environment.\"\n\nLeveraging Ergotron's commercial success in the corporate sit-stand market, ErgotronHome is creating products that combine beauty and thoughtfulness with the functionality trademark of the parent company. The Workspace collection includes four furniture-inspired standing workspace solutions for better technology use and organization in the home:\n\nThe Workspace Hub24 and Hub27 are wall-mounted standing worksurfaces and organizers that brings storage, organization, convention and charging capabilities to areas all over the home\u2014both units offer a slim profile, making it ideal for shared or multi\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2018purpose spaces. For consumers looking for more functionality from their unit, the larger Hub27 holds more devices, features easy worksurface height adjustment when in standing mode to suit the user and the task at hand, and can be key-locked when not in use to secure contents. Workspace Lift24 and Lift35 turns any surface into a flexible (and stylish) sit-stand desk, instantly giving you the health benefits of movement. The Lift24 is an innovative portable laptop stand with 8\" (20 cm) of standing-desk adjustment; it folds up to compact size for easy transport or storage and can be a full-function workspace for laptop or table when paired with an external keyboard. The Lift35, a stable adjustable standing desk that rests on existing tabletops or desks, includes a counterbalancing mechanism which facilitates up to 15\" (38 cm) quick height adjustment that does not protrude beyond the tabletop. It also features a generous worksurface and is designed for use with laptops, all-in-one computers or multiple monitors. \n\n\"You've probably heard the rallying cry 'sitting is the new smoking.' Ergotron products are being used by millions of corporations around the world to reduce sedentary computing time, but the options that exist specifically for the home are few and far between,\" explained Wardleworth. \"ErgotronHome offers the same amazing benefits of standing to consumers in products that are appealing for the home environment.\"\n\n\"Ergotron is committed to delivering innovative solutions that promote healthier, more productive environments \u2013 no matter the setting,\" said Pete Segar, group president of Nortek's Ergonomic and Productivity Solutions segment. \"We have seen a dramatic uptick in demand for technology accessories that offer health benefits, especially those that aim to reduce sedentary time. I am confident that just as Ergotron pioneered the sit-stand corporate office landscape, ErgotronHome will transform the home front.\"\n\nErgotronHome is making its market debut with the Workspace collection at Dwell on Design New York, October 1-3.
