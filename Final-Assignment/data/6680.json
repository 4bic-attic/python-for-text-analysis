Bloggin\u2019 Mamas is sponsoring this giveaway in support of the Ad Council and the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s \u201cDiscover the Forest\u201d campaign celebrating the recent National Public Lands Day (September 26th). \n\nDiscover the Forest #NaturehoodWe would like to encourage you to enjoy your local #Naturehood and to help encourage others to do the same. These \u201cnaturehoods\u201d are just a short drive away, making it easy for families to unplug from the daily routine and re-connect with nature. Does it ever seem like your kids aren\u2019t spending nearly as much time outdoors as you did when we were little? With all of the new technologies and overscheduling of today\u2019s world, it\u2019s easy to forget just how close\u2014and how important\u2014 your local forest or green space really is for your kids! There are many developmental benefits for children who spend time in nature, and it\u2019s closer than you think. Did you know? Children who play outside are more creative, have lower stress levels and more active imaginations. They also become fitter and leaner, develop stronger immune systems, and have greater respect for themselves and others as well as the environment. \n\nCheck Out This Cool Experiment \n\n\u201dA bit of back story on it: For the most part, it was a real, live experiment with kids. We really did promise that they would get to test out \u201cthe most realistic game in production,\u201d and bussed them to a local NYC park to do so. We got to watch their reactions when they realized that the forest itself was the game!\u201d Below is a quote from the video\u2019s creative director that you should feel free to use: \u201cWe tricked a bunch of kids into putting down their video games by telling them that they\u2019d be testing an even better video game. When we finally revealed that the forest itself was the game, they weren\u2019t the least bit disappointed. As a mom, I see firsthand how stressed out kids are these days and how hard they\u2019re pushed by school requirements and state testing. It was a pleasure to work on a project supporting getting kids out into nature which is scientifically proven to offer meaningful health benefits to these kids,\u201d said Jill Applebaum, Creative Director. \n\nMore Cool Resources & Info \n\nEvery neighborhood has a #Naturehood\u2014so tell us about yours in a blog post.
