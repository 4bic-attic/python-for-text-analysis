Built around revolutionarily tiny\u2014and fast\u2014high-bandwidth memory, the six-inch Radeon R9 Nano delivers flagship-level performance in a form factor that fits where most other graphics cards simply can\u2019t.\n\nIn an age where graphics cards keep expanding with heat pipes and heat sinks and fans in order to push performance to 11, the Nano\u2019s more holistic design approach is a breath of fresh air, dragging mini-ITX (mITX) graphics cards out from the shadows and into the spotlight. It truly feels forward-thinking\u2014the first top-tier graphics card designed for a future where mainstream computing increasingly shifts towards NUCs and Steam Machines and small-form-factor designs and PCs-on-a-stick. There\u2019s no other card out there like quite it, and the Nano will bring tremendous joy to the people pining for its particular blend of high-end features.\n\nBut pushing the PC ecosystem forward isn\u2019t possible without some growing pains. The $650 Radeon Nano rocks, but it won\u2019t appeal to everybody\u2014not by a long shot.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in.\n\nAMD Radeon R9 Nano under the hood\n\nThe $650 asking price for the Radeon R9 Nano shocked some people, but AMD\u2019s deft design of the Nano goes a long way toward justifying the flagship-level cost. This is the most powerful mini-ITX graphics card ever created, and every aspect of it screams premium.\n\nHow Nano\u2019s so small: @Gordonung\u2019s Project Quantum dissection shows Fiji GPU vs a 290X board http://t.co/0gGG3aAqM6 pic.twitter.com/p3xSCHjqeI\n\nThe Nano\u2019s six-inch length is its most notable feature, naturally, enabled by the tremendous space and power savings of high-bandwidth memory, which is integrated with the GPU. The card\u2019s a hair smaller in both length and width than Asus\u2019 GTX 970 DirectCU Mini, the Nano\u2019s closest GeForce-based miniature competitor. (Nvidia doesn\u2019t offer mini-ITX variants of the GTX 980 or 980 Ti.)\n\nOne more: The @AMDRadeon R9 Nano is slightly shorter than the Asus GeForce GTX 970 DirectCU Mini mITX graphics card pic.twitter.com/z8JHa9d4qp\n\nAnd it\u2019s downright puny compared to the hulking Asus Strix Fury. The Fury is AMD\u2019s other air-cooled graphics card built around a Fiji GPU and cutting-edge high-bandwidth memory.\n\nWell look what just showed up from @AMDRadeon: The R9 Nano.
