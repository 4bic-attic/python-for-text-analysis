Some of our vets haven\u2019t been on the ice a lot but they just kind of got off the ice and they\u2019ll work their way into shape here,\u201d said Terriers assistant coach Paul Harland. \n \nFive returning players from last year\u2019s RBC Cup winning roster were at camp: forwards Shawn Bowles, Brad Bowles and Jaryd Wiebe, and defencemen Brett Orr and Dean Stewart. With much of the 2015 RBC Cup roster having vacated, there is opportunity abound for prospective Terriers. \n \n\u201cSo far there are some surprises that we\u2019re happy about and we\u2019ll see how they\u2019ll make out moving forward,\u201d Harland said. \n\r\n\u00a0 \n \nOne major question mark comes in the Terriers\u2019 crease, after the club traded both goaltenders Justin Laforest and Zac Robidoux in the offseason. It appears Richard Park, whom Portage acquired in a July trade with the SIJHL\u2019s Fort Frances Lakers, is the early favourite to break camp as the starting goalie. \n \n\u201cWe saw him this weekend and he looks good,\u201d said Harland of Park. \u201cI think we\u2019re in pretty good shape for goaltending ... Nichol and Klassen are in camp and both have shown well. We\u2019ll move forward with some exhibition games and see how it works out. \n \nPark, 20, began his junior career with the Spruce Grove Saints (AJHL) and then spent parts of two seasons with the Selkirk Steelers before posting a 1.92 GAA and .931 save percentage in 19 starts for the Fort Frances Lakers in 2014-15. \n \nForward Ezra Hall, acquired in a June trade with the Winnipeg Blues that saw the Terriers move defenceman Kevin Pochuk, should slot in to one of the vacated forward positions. Hall, listed at 6-foot-5, 196-lbs, was selected in the NAHL draft by the Austin Bruins. It wasn\u2019t clear until training camp where he intended on playing in 2015-16. \n \n\u201cWe were one of his options and he had some other options but now he\u2019s here and we\u2019re happy he\u2019s here,\u201d said Harland. \u201cHe\u2019s a big body and he looks good out there. Hopefully he\u2019ll be able to score some goals for us.\u201d \n \nHall recorded 12 goals and 14 assists in 53 games for Winnipeg in 2014-15. \n \nThe Terriers opened with 60 players at rookie camp on Friday. By Sunday, 40 players remained for main camp. \n \n\u201cWe should be in the low 30\u2019s for guys by next week,\u201d Harland said. \n \nTerriers exhibition schedule \n \nThe first test of game action for the players in the mix at Terriers\u2019 training camp comes on Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m. at the PCU Centre, as the team opens its exhibition schedule against the Virden Oil Capitals. \n\r\nPortage has five more MJHL exhibition games scheduled (home dates noted in boldface): Sept. 9 at Virden Oil Capitals, Sept. 11 vs. Winkler Flyers , Sept. 13 at Winkler Flyers, Sept. 19 at Winnipeg Blues and Sept. 20 vs. Winnipeg Blues. \n\r\n\u00a0", "source": "Portage Daily Graphic"}
