Officers were called to the scene and approached him in the parking lot.\n\nPolice say the teenage suspect lead them on a foot chase across the street, behind a group of businesses, into a dead-end alley and started screaming at the officer and making threats.\n\nWitnesses tell police the officer tried pleading with the suspect.\n\n\u201cThe suspect on the other hand, according to witnesses and others, repeatedly use profanities, screamed and yelled at the officer, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you. I\u2019m going to kill you. I\u2019m going to kill you\u2019,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nPolice say the video shows the suspect aggressively approaching the lone officer, as if he has a weapon. The he reached around his waist, whipped out his hand and points it at the officer, which ends with the officer firing three shots at the suspect.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like they were working him very hard, trying to revive him,\u201d said Jessie Issa, of Mondo Pizza.\n\nMcLeod was later pronounced dead.\nWe keep attempting to educate people to the fact that \u201cunarmed\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cnot a threat,\u201d nor is it clear in many instances that the suspect is unarmed until well after the suspect is down. McLeod did everything he could to convince the officer that he was armed, perhaps hoping that the officer would back off and allow him to escape.\n\nMcLeod:\n\n\tverbally threatened the officer\n\tmock charged the officer\n\tacted as if he was drawing a gun\n\nYes,\u00a0Keith Harrison McLeod was later found to be \u201cunarmed.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that he did everything in his power to try to convince the officer that he had a weapon.\n\nThis was clearly a legally justified shooting.", "source": "Give Me Liberty"}
