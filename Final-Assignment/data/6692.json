They\u2019re just so cute and I love that both Victoria and David are so unabashedly affectionate with their kids and the kids don\u2019t seem to mind one bit. I\u2019ve never heard of entitled or spoiled behaviour about any of their kids. \n \nVictoria posted this adorable shot with her new teenager (and her total mini-me) to her Instagram page with the caption \u2018Happy birthday baby boy. We r all so proud and love you so, so much. x \" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> 13 today!!!! X mummy\u2019 \n     \n Happy birthday baby boy.
