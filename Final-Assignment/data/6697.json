[MN]", "id": "d2801fc4-4578-4c24-b814-ac8cfca9dee3", "content": "Nick Moody indeed has signed with the Seattle Seahawks, but rather than be on their opening-day roster, he\u2019s on their practice squad, a league source stated Saturday. \n \nMoody, once a candidate to start for the 49ers in what would be his third season, instead was among Saturday\u2019s casualties as they cut their roster to 53 players. \n \nMoody is the eighth former 49ers player to head to the Seahawks since 2013, following\u00a0wide receivers Ricardo Lockette and Brett Swain, quarterback B.J. Daniels, cornerback Perrish Cox, long snapper Kyle Nelson and defensive linemen Will Tukuafu and Demarcus Dobbs. \n \nLockette, Daniels, Tukuafu and Dobbs remain on the Seahawks\u2019 53-main\u00a0roster. Cox and Nelson eventually returned to the 49ers, and Nelson remains the 49ers long snapper. \n\n\r\n\r \r \r\n\r \r \r  \nMoody, a 2013 sixth-round draft pick out of Florida State, was regarded so much\u00a0his rookie year that he received the team\u2019s only\u00a0injured reserve/designated-for-return tag. He ended up only playing three games in 2013\u00a0upon returning from a broken hand, and he appeared in every game last year, starting the final two. \n \nNaVorro Bowman and Michael Wilhoite will start at inside linebacker in the 49ers season opener Monday night, and their backups are Shayne Skov and Nick Bellore.", "source": "San Jose Mercury News"}
