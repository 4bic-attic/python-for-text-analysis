Many have had this deconstructive experience. Being truly fucked-up is in direct proportion to lack of self-awareness. Everyone is aware; self-awareness sees through everyone. Oneself transforming oneself sees through oneself. One seeing through itself is absolutely it! Warning. You are probably emotionally damaged if you need to see through yourself. So think about it if you can. Self-deconstruction is founded on forgiveness, insight, and devotion. The golden rule: don't pass on your shit. One equals forgiveness plus compassion plus love times the unknown. If one is the unknown, one is. If one is other than the unknown, one is divided and separate and alone. As long as you're playing, don't leave any love on the table. Ourselves\u2014forgive oneself forgetfulness\u2014see with clarity oneself\u2014and devote oneself to that oneself as one does\u2014realize oneself\u2014love, no one.
