Dimly lit with some string lights, the room only had a bar and about 30 chairs; the \u201cstage\u201d was an open area less than a yard from the audience. While some may consider these less than ideal concert conditions, they resulted in an intimate setting that resembled a mere meeting amongst friends, allowing McQuaid\u2019s music to shine.\u00a0 \n \nRather than blast her listeners with as much noise as possible, Sarah prefers to form a connection with her audience, much like a storyteller.\u00a0 \n \nShe started the show by performing her newest album, \"Walking Into White,\" which exhibits the range of her talents. The wizardly Spanish guitar of \u201cYellowstone\u201d and the pleasant Celtic guitar of the instrumental \u201cI Am Grateful For What I Have\u201d represent some of her traditional works, while the low-key electric guitar in the background of \u201cLow Winter Sun\u201d and echoes, stomps and claps of the sense-tingling \u201cJackdaws Rising\u201d are emblematic of Sarah\u2019s experimentation with new media. \u201cSweetness and Pain\u201d, an acapella song split into three parts, highlighted McQuaid\u2019s voice\u2014the audience was enraptured with its ethereal sound.\u00a0\u00a0 \n[embedded content] \nIn between songs Sarah chatted with the audience and shared the story behind each of her songs, often with a laugh and a smile.\u00a0 \n \nAfter a short break she returned, only to connect with the audience even more. During \u201cWest Virginia Boys\u201d, an Appalachian tune from her second album, she got fans to sing the last line of each verse, and in an unreleased cover of Jean Ritchie\u2019s \u201cBlue Diamond Mines\u201d, she asked the audience to join in on the chorus\u2014they were more than happy to oblige; Sarah said she got chills in her spine. Also notable was \u201cOnly an Emotion,\" McQuaid\u2019s moving commentary on grief.\u00a0 \n\nWith her versatile guitar and steady, soothing voice, McQuaid gradually drew in her audience into almost a trance, her music and stories like a blanket keeping fans rapt in attention\u2014coming unwound only when the night was over.\u00a0", "source": "Crimson White Online"}
