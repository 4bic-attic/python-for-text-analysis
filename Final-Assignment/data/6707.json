Photo: White House. \n \nJNS.org \u2013\u00a0 The High Holidays are here, reaching\u00a0their crescendo with Yom Kippur\u2019s Kol Nidre prayer, made famous by Al Jolson and Neil Diamond in \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d movies. The literal meaning of Kol Nidre is \u201call vows.\u201d More broadly, the prayer deals with the importance of words in shaping our lives, setting the tone for who we are \u2014 what we represent. \n \nIts message stands opposite the old adage we said as kids: \u201cSticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.\u201d \n \nNot true. Words can hurt; words can harm. While a word is a word and a deed is a deed, words lead to deeds. \n \nA Jewish teaching declares that words have the intensity of fire. They are black fire on white fire, namely, black letters written on the white open space between them. More deeply, this teaches that words have power not only in their explicit meaning \u2014 the ink of the black letters \u2014 but in the less explicit, but equally important messages they imply. Those are the white spaces. \n \nAs 20th-century Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said, \u201cLanguage disguises the thought.\u201d But the discerning listener of language can read the white fire, revealing its meaning. \n \nThis is an important message as the debate surrounding the Iran nuclear deal gains intensity. By now, the pros and cons of the deal have been presented. Positions have by and large been taken. I, for one, am strongly opposed. \n \nBut a matter that is equally as important as the position one takes is the nature of the language used in the conversation. Which words are said? What is their message and what thoughts do they disguise? \n \nHere, both sides have made mistakes. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican candidate for president, went too far when suggesting that the deal would take Israel to the ovens, an explicit allusion to the Holocaust \u2014 when six\u00a0million Jews were murdered, often gassed and then incinerated. The Holocaust is trivialized when such language is used. Today, unlike then, we have the state of Israel, which can defend itself. \n \nWhat\u2019s even more disturbing is the language used by President Barack Obama. Candidates seek partisan voters. The president speaks for all of America. As Obama has said, we are not the red states, or the blue states, but the United States. \n \nThe president violated this commitment when he spoke last month at American University. There, he used language that implicitly isolated American Jews by questioning their loyalty. He did so when he said that the nuclear deal\u2019s opponents are \u201cbacked by tens of millions of dollars in advertising.\u201d The white fire of these words is understood by many Americans as referring to Jewish dollars. \n \nAnd when Obama presents the decision of Congress as a choice between approving the Iran deal and war \u2014 while singling out Israel as the agreement\u2019s key opponent \u2014 he is interpreted by many as saying that Israel could be sending Americans to war. \n \nOf course, this is absurd. Americans have died defending Iraq and Lebanon, but never Israel. Still, the president\u2019s language implies that turning down the deal could result in Americans defending and dying for Israel. \n \nAt rallies this summer, I\u2019ve heard too many hurl invectives at us like \u201ctraitor,\u201d \u201cgo back to Israel where you belong,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re sending American soldiers to die for Israel.\u201d \n \nLicense for the use of this type of dangerous language comes from the top. It emerges in part from the unwritten words that the president has uttered. \n   \u00a0Good people can have honest disagreements. Kol Nidre reminds us that how we express these positions also matters. The words we choose \u2014 both those written in black and hidden in white \u2014 make a difference.    \nAs the Jewish adage goes, \u201cWise people, be careful with your words.\u201d \n \nAvi Weiss is the founding rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale in New York City.
