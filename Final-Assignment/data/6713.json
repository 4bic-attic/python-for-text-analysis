That said, it might be time for the Cowboys to finally start looking for a successor. \n \nFormer Cowboys quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Troy Aikman said it's at least time to start having the conversation. \n \n\"I'm certainly not writing him off, I think he has good years left, but I think in the next year or so you're going to have to look and say, 'OK, well we are going to have to draft some young guys the way the Packers did for most of Brett Favre's career,'\" he said on 'The Herd.' \n \n\"I don't think they're having that conversation today. I think the conversation they're having today is that we have to go sign somebody.\" \n \nBrandon Weeden filled in for Romo and went 7-for-7 for 73 yards and a touchdown, but they Cowboys didn't have another quarterback on the depth chart after that. \n \n\"They have to find somebody that can at least come in and play the position in the event Brandon Weeden goes down.\"", "source": "FOXNews.com"}
