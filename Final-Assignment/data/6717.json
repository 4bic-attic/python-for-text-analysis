The events of that day changed the lives of many people, including Bert Upson, a Palm Desert resident who was in New York to give a business seminar to a group of sales executives.\n\nHe was on the mountain last month, talking with the Mountain Sunrise Rotary Club about his experience in one of the towers at the World Trade Center.\n\nOn that morning, Upson said, he walked five or six blocks from his hotel to the World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cIt was a clear day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were 4,400 airplanes in the air. It was a magnificent day. It felt so good and I was happy to be alive.\u201d\n\nThe seminar Upson was to give was in the South Tower on the 78th floor, the floor that was hit by the second plane.\n\nAt 8:46 a.m. Upson heard a big bang. \u201cThe hackles went up on the back of my neck,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lights dimmed and the building shook. I said to myself, \u2018This is a big one.\u2019\n\n\u201cI made the decision to leave the building.\n\n\u201cWhat was a clear day was now a dark day because of all the stuff shooting by.\u201d\n\nHe said to the 14 people gathered for the seminar, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Eleven went with him, three decided to stay.\n\nAs they headed out into the hall, a voice on the loudspeaker announced that it wasn\u2019t the South Tower that had been hit, that it was OK for people to go back to their offices.\n\nBut Upson was determined to leave the building, although he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhere getting out of there was.\u201d A woman named Carol told him she would show him the way.\n\n\u201cWe started walking very fast,\u201d Upson said. They reached the elevator bank, with stairs next to it. The sign over the elevator said, \u201cIn case of emergency, take the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No way,\u2019\u201d Upson said. And like a miracle, just at that moment the elevator doors opened.\n\n\u201cPeople from the floors above had the same idea so it was hard to get on. I had to fight to stay in and had to push people out. That was one of the most horrible moments of my life. There was pounding and scratching on the doors as we took off.\u201d\n\nThe elevator descended at the rate of a floor of a second\u201478 seconds later Upson was propelled out onto the concourse and went out the front door.\n\n\u201cJust as I got outside I heard another boom,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked up and saw a plane hitting the South Tower. Stuff was flying off the buildings. The streets were filling with ash and soot. There was a fireball coming down the street.\n\n\u201cCarol got knocked down. I had to decide whether to stop and pick her up.\u201d He did and the two started running for the East River. \u201cWe were going to jump in and swim to Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nSuddenly his hotel appeared out of the dark.\n\nUpson set up a triage station in the hotel with coffee, water and damp towels. At 3 p.m. a call came into the hotel that the water was being turned off. Then at 4 they were told the electricity was being turned off and that their safety could not be guaranteed.\n\nUpson left the hotel, intending once again to run to the East River. On his way, he was confronted by three tall boys who first appeared to want his autograph as they thought he was a hero after he told them his story. But then they moved in closer, threatening him and asking for money. A SWAT team member intervened, telling Upson the \u201cboys\u201d were part of a notorious gang.\n\n\u201cThe fear didn\u2019t end when the planes hit,\u201d he said.\n\nUpson got on the last subway that ran that day, heading north. He got off at 53rd Street and got to a hotel where he had stayed before.\n\n\u201cI thought I would die in bed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t going to happen again.\u201d\n\nBut Upson pointed to some of the good that happened that day. The Coast Guard, he said, put out a call for all boats to respond to the area. The call was answered by 230 boats, whose captains put signs on their boats indicating where they were going.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked one how many passengers he could take, he said it was how many he could get on.\u201d These boat lifters carried people to safety.\n\nThe next day he went to New Jersey to a memorial service for the three men who stayed behind.\n\nHis message for terrorists, Upson said, is \u201cgo away, don\u2019t come back, you\u2019re not welcome here, we don\u2019t want you here.\u201d\n\nThe United States, he added, \u201crose to the challenge of survival, rebuilding our psyche. There was a large surge in recruiting into the Armed Forces after 9/11. Church attendance accelerated. American flags were everywhere.\u201d\n\nUpson said he has told his story 150 times. \u201cEvery time I feel like I\u2019m back there.\u201d\n\nHe has written his story in a book titled On a Clear Day. His purpose is to bring the events of Sept. 11 back to everyone\u2019s consciousness.\n\nMountain News\n\nPhone number: (909) 336-3555\n\nE-mail: jbrown@mountain-news.com\n\nAddress: P.O.
