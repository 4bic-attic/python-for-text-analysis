Surely that's what Javier Caso, custodian for Mexican second division side Zacatepec, was thinking after his laughable mistake cost his side dearly. \n\nHaving just saved a free kick against rivals Necaxa, Caso looked to quickly release a teammate down the left wing. However, in a spectacular piece of poor timing, the goalkeeper's throw clattered into Necaxa player Rodrigo Prieto. \n\nPrieto appeared to know little about it, but the ball went flying off the back of his head into the goal to make it 1-1. \n\nNot surprisingly, the embarrassed goalkeeper remonstrated with the referee in the vain hope that a free kick might be called for Prieto obstructing the 'keeper's distribution. \n\nAnd he might have had a point, with a slight hint that Prieto's feet had left the ground just as the throw was made. \n\nHowever, the officials offered no escape, meaning one of the more bizarre goals scored in recent times stood. Necaxa went on to win the game 3-1.", "source": "Farm Weekly"}
