On average, it measures about 1 mm. \n \nDr. Emma Perry, a professor of marine biology at the college's Center for Biodiversity, named the species Echiniscoides Wyethi. \n \nPerry documented her team's May 2014 discovery in a paper published in The Biological Society of Washington. \n \nThe Wyeth family includes three generations of artists -- N.C., son Andrew and grandson Jamie. \n \nInformation from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com", "source": "13 WLOS"}
