They were in complete disrepair,\u201d he said. \n\nThe process, according to O\u2019Brien, took a few months. After he selected the project, it had to be approved by both his troop and the parks commission. He then had to plan the project and assess which of the posts were in good condition, and which were rotted and needed to be dug out and reinstalled. \n\nThis was an especially hard task, according to Byer, because the posts - which only protruded about one foot from the ground - were actually about four feet underground. \n\nBut with the help of friends and family, O\u2019Brien was able to finish the work in just three days. \n\nThe hardest part, joked O\u2019Brien, was keeping his friends - who were helping him with the project - on task when one of them brought a basketball. \n\n\u201cIt was a lot of work, but it was really rewarding looking back at it,\u201d he said. \n\nO\u2019Brien, who is working on his last few steps to become an Eagle Scout, said it is \u201ccoming down to the wire,\u201d with his 18th birthday approaching in October, the deadline for reaching such status. Becoming an Eagle Scout requires 21 merit badges, and while O\u2019Brien already has 38, he is working on his \u201cpersonal fitness badge,\u201d which is the last of the specifically required badges he has left to earn. He also must complete an extensive workbook, a review process and an interview before being officially declared an Eagle Scout. \n\nHe said he is very \u201cthankful to the parks department\u201d for providing him the opportunity. \n\nThe Mendon Parks Department is also thankful for O'Brien's hard work and dedication. Byer said the project is appreciated because \u201cthe basketball courts are totally booked all summer and it looked pretty terrible, so it\u2019s good to have it done.\u201d \n\nCorin Cook can be reached at ccook@wickedlocal.com or 508-634-7521.
