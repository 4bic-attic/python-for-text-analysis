He is confronted with\u00a0what some of\u00a0Russia\u2019s international partners interpret as\u00a0an opposition. \n \nIn reality, he said, al-Assad's army is fighting against\u00a0terrorist organisations. \n Vladimir Putin gives interview to CBS channel  \n\u201cYou should know better than\u00a0me about\u00a0the hearings that have just taken place in\u00a0the United States Senate, where the military and Pentagon representatives, if I am not mistaken, reported to\u00a0the senators about\u00a0what the United States had done to\u00a0train the combat part of\u00a0the opposition forces.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe initial aim was to\u00a0train between\u00a05,000 and 6,000 fighters, and then 12,000 more. It turns out\u00a0that only 60 of\u00a0these fighters have been properly trained, and as\u00a0few as\u00a04 or 5 people actually carry weapons, while the rest of\u00a0them have deserted with\u00a0their American weapons to\u00a0join ISIS. That is the first point.\u201d \n \n\u201cSecondly, in\u00a0my opinion, the provision of\u00a0military support to\u00a0illegal structures runs counter to\u00a0the principles of\u00a0modern international law and the United Nations Charter. We have been providing assistance to\u00a0legitimate government entities only.\u201d \n \nIn late June, President Putin called on\u00a0Syria and countries such as\u00a0Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to\u00a0join forces in\u00a0the battle against\u00a0the Islamic State by\u00a0establishing an anti-terrorism coalition. Later, he discussed the issue with\u00a0his US counterpart Barack Obama. \n\u201cI have personally informed the President of\u00a0Turkey, the King of\u00a0Jordan, as\u00a0well as\u00a0Saudi Arabia of\u00a0that; we informed the United States too, and Mr Kerry, whom you have mentioned, had an in-depth conversation with\u00a0our Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on\u00a0this matter; additionally, our military stay in\u00a0touch and discuss this issue.\u201d \n\u201cWe would welcome a common platform for\u00a0collective action against\u00a0the terrorists.\u201d \n \nPutin on\u00a0the UN: \u2018The decision to\u00a0establish the United Nations was made in\u00a0our country at\u00a0the Yalta Conference\u2019 \n \nThe Russian head of\u00a0state will certainly take a chance to\u00a0talk on\u00a0the history of\u00a0the United Nations. He will remind that the final decision to\u00a0establish the United Nations was taken at\u00a0the Yalta Conference in\u00a0the Soviet Union. \n \nThe Soviet Union was a founding member state of\u00a0the United Nations and a permanent member of\u00a0its Security Council, and Russia is the successor state to\u00a0the Soviet Union, the president stressed. \nThe Yalta Conference took place in\u00a0a Russian resort town in\u00a0the Crimea from\u00a0February 4\u201311, 1945, during\u00a0World War Two.\u00a0 At Yalta, the three leaders Joseph Stalin, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill together with\u00a0their foreign ministers and chiefs of\u00a0staff made important decisions regarding the future progress of\u00a0the war and the postwar world. \nIn Yalta, the politicians declared their resolve to\u00a0establish a general international organization to\u00a0maintain peace and security. \n \n\u201cWe are resolved,\u201d the three leaders declared, \u201cupon the earliest possible establishment with\u00a0our Allies of\u00a0a general international organization to\u00a0maintain peace and security\u2026 \u201cWe have agreed that a Conference of\u00a0United Nations should be called to\u00a0meet at\u00a0San Francisco in\u00a0the United States on\u00a0the 25th April, 1945, to\u00a0prepare the charter of\u00a0such an organization, along\u00a0the lines proposed in\u00a0the formal conversations of\u00a0Dumbarton Oaks.\u201d \n \nAnd, Finally, Why Putin Will Address the UN: \u2018To explain Russia's vision of\u00a0today's international relations, as\u00a0well as\u00a0the future of\u00a0this organisation and the global community\u2019 \nThe president will have to\u00a0say a few words about\u00a0the present day, about\u00a0the evolving international situation, about\u00a0the fact that the United Nations remains the sole universal international organisation designed to\u00a0maintain global peace. \n\u201cAnd in\u00a0this sense it has no alternative today. It is also apparent that it should adapt to\u00a0the ever-changing world, which we discuss all the time: how it should evolve and at\u00a0what rate, which components should undergo qualitative changes.\u201d \n \n\u201cOf course, I will have to\u00a0or rather should use this international platform to\u00a0explain Russia's vision of\u00a0today's international relations, as\u00a0well as\u00a0the future of\u00a0this organisation and the global community,\u201d he stressed.", "source": "Sputnik"}
