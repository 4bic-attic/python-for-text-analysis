Captain Vorina Kerina attributed the win to a well-organised structure in all the quarters to lead 9-6, 20-15, 30-21, 39-25. \nYvonne Macknally, Mato, Annisha Adula, Daisy Adula, Kuno, Freda Mayo and Kerina were in devastating form all day. \nThe opposition tried desperately but to no avail as silly errors and poor defence denied them any advantage. \nProvincial government spokesperson Elizabeth Malori acknowledged the women\u2019s sport and vowed to support it in her capacity. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to witness young talent and mothers actively involved to promote and develop it to the next level,\u201d Malori said. \nAssociation president Dorothy ToBata and her executives plan to send an under-21 team to the national championship in Alotau.\u00a0 \nTobata is appealing for government and corporate support.", "source": "Papua New Guinea National"}
