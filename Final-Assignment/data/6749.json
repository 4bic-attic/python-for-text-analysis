A popular holiday-weekend form of entertainment all over the country, the Renaissance fair has nothing to do with the Italian Renaissance, offering instead a melange of earlier British medieval history that arrives in the present day via Mark Twain\u2019s A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur\u2019s Court and the Errol Flynn Robin Hood, taking in jesters going \u2018hey nonny nonny\u2019, knights in shining armour, dragons and random fairground attractions along the way. But fair enough. It\u2019s the US. The average European would find it hard to name most US presidents of the 18th century, let alone know the difference between the Roanoake and Jamestown colonies. Let\u2019s not quibble too much over it and we can always take the kids to the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas and enjoy a permanent Renaissance Fair if we want. The problem is when you get something like The Bastard Executioner, Kurt \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d Sutter\u2019s latest show on FX. Allegedly set in the early 14th century in Wales during the reign of Edward II (US readers: that\u2019s the wimpy gay one in Braveheart), it sees one man lead a rebellion of the Welsh peasants against the evil English baron who\u2019s oppressing the masses. And while The Bastard Executioner would very much like to be a rousing, gritty historical drama, it is instead pretty much a Renaissance Fair on TV. About\nKurt Sutter\u2019s follow-up drama to Sons Of Anarchy is officially a go at FX. The cable network has picked up Sutter\u2019s gritty Late Middle Ages drama pilot The Bastard Executioner to series with a 10-episode order. The pickup to the project, from Imagine TV, Fox 21 TV Studios and FX Prods., comes just as the the pilot wrapped production in Wales. Production on the series will resume there in the summer. A period drama, The Bastard Executioner tells the story of a warrior knight (Lee Jones) in King Edward I\u2019s charge who is broken by the ravages of war and vows to lay down his sword. But when that violence finds him again he is forced to pick up the bloodiest sword of all. \u201cFrom his important contributions to The Shield to his epic run on Sons Of Anarchy, Kurt has been one of FX\u2019s most visionary artists, and we are proud to get him back on the air so soon after the unquestionable success of Sons,\u201d said FX Networks CEO John Landgraf. Added Sutter, \u201cI love history. I love theology. I love blood. It\u2019s been very satisfying weaving fact and fiction to create a new mythology that combines all these elements. And with this extraordinary cast \u2014 Stephen Moyer, Katey Sagal and newcomer Lee Jones \u2014 this world explodes on screen. I love working with FX and Fox21TVS. They\u2019ve been my family for 15 years. They not only tolerate me, they embrace my extremely disturbing storytelling sensibilities.\u201d Bastard Executioner, created by Sutter, features series regulars Jones, Moyer, SOA\u2018s Sagal and Sutter, Flora Spencer-Longhurst, Sam Spruell, Darren Evans, Danny Sapani, Timothy V. Murphy, Sarah White, Sarah Sweeney, Elen Rhys, Ethan Griffiths and guest star Matthew Rhys. \u201cKurt Sutter and Brian Grazer have been spectacular creative partners \u2014 and dear friends \u2014 to our studio for years, and their collaboration has resulted in a fantastic and epic new series,\u201d said Fox TV Group chairmen and CEOs Gary Newman and Dana Walden, who called The Bastard Executioner \u201cdangerous, brilliant, emotional and undeniable.\u201d Is it any good?\nI\u2019m assuming Kurt Sutter is a big Mel Gibson fan because The Bastard Executioner is basically an even less historically accurate version of Gibson's Braveheart and The Patriot, but set in Wales. The pilot, which is made up of two episodes, is very much a show of two halves. The first half is almost unbearably bad and unintelligible; the second, when the show settles more into the general format for the series, is considerably more palatable but still has enough residual idiocy that you\u2019ll wonder if Sutter has been punching himself in the head as an act of method writing. The show\u2019s biggest problem is that although the show is set and filmed in Wales, it\u2019s not clear that Sutter actually knows what Wales is or at least can recognise a difference between it and England. Certainly, he\u2019s so sympathetic to Welsh culture that the most obviously Welsh person is having a love affair with his sheep. I\u2019m sure Sutter thinks that\u2019s a fond bit of ribbing and a demonstration that he knows something about the Welsh - but they\u2019ll glass him in Cardiff if he ever goes there. Things get worse though. It\u2019s the 14th century yet not a single Welsh person speaks Welsh, not even momentary special guest star Matthew Rhys who does actually speak Welsh. If Game of Thrones can get a whole bunch of people to speak entirely made up languages for huge swathes of time, you wouldn\u2019t have thought it hard to poach just a few of Pobol Y Cwm\u2019s cast members for a week or two to speak an actual living language, would you? Nevertheless, this wouldn\u2019t be so bad if they\u2019d had everyone sounding English instead, but three of them have Welsh accents while everyone else sounds English. Except for the English, surprisingly, who are largely played by Americans, Australians, Irish and Canadian actors, all struggling to do an RP accent. Virtually lone 'Englishman playing an Englishman', Stephen Moyer (True Blood), meanwhile has decided he\u2019s going to be playing his English nobleman in Wales as if he\u2019s in the East End of London. It\u2019s like he\u2019s playing a joke on Sutter and the US audience: \u201cBet you can\u2019t even tell the bloody difference.\u201d And then there\u2019s long-time Sutter favourite Katy Sagal playing a witch by way of Eastern Europe, who nevertheless has visions from angels. What\u2019s going on there, I don\u2019t know. All very confusing for Brits, but ultimately no one in Armpit, Idaho is going to notice, I\u2019m sure, any more than they notice whether someone is using a cutlass, a rapier or a broadsword down at the fair. Trickier to process, however, is the cod medieval dialogue which coupled with the accent struggles means most of the cast are literally incomprehensible or seem to be as enthused as if they were reading out the instructions for their HMRC Self-Assessment. Fortunately, that dissipates in part two, but you\u2019ll leave part one wondering what the hell is going on and why everyone\u2019s so concerned with otter pelts. As well as the setting, the historical accuracy and the general \u201cEnglish bad, everyone else good\u201d attitude, Sutter\u2019s also got Gibson\u2019s love of extreme gore down pat. Want to see someone disembowelled, have their skin removed from their back, a knife stuck in their head, their throat gouged out with a stick, a sword rammed in their chest or, as the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a pregnant woman stabbed in the stomach and then her foetus and entrails placed on her chest? Then this is the show for you, but you might want to ask yourself what\u2019s wrong with you. Unfortunately, though, no one thought to hire a director with Gibson\u2019s skill at action scenes, because The Bastard Executioner\u2019s are risibly shot and substitute all that gore for even remotely well choreographed sword fights. In common with\u00a0Game of Thrones, the show tries to be gritty and medieval. Sutter wants to go further, though, which means giving everyone bad teeth and having someone to wipe the Baron's bottom with a rag. All the same, apparently these things have limits, because everyone's clothes look like they've just come straight from the dry cleaners and their hair is\u00a0natural, nourised, moisturised, volumised and thickened with natural pro-keratin extracts. The show ends with the status quo for the series established, which might well solve a lot of these problems. I doubt it, but it\u2019s at least more promising than it seemed when it started. All the same it\u2019s laughable bobbins, not quite as implausible as Da Vinci\u2019s Demons but getting there. And if you are going to watch it and you\u2019re a Brit, you\u2019re going to have to resist the huge urge to scream at the TV \u201cNo, you\u2019re cowing not - you're bloody English!\u201d every time Flora Spencer-Longhurst says \u201cI\u2019m just a Welsh girl.\"", "source": "The Medium is Not Enough TV blog"}
