It did not locate the launch site. \n \nThe Long March-5 carrier rocket was designed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. \n \nIt is scheduled to make its first trial flight in 2016. \n \nWith a payload capacity of 14 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit, the largest carrying capacity in China, the rocket will greatly increase China's ability to enter space. \n \nChina plans to launch its Chang'e-5 lunar probe carried by the Long March-5 carrier rocket around 2017 to finish the last chapter in China's three-step (orbiting, landing and return) moon exploration program. \n \nThe final phase involved landing the rover and return back to earth. \n \nChang'e-5 is expected to achieve several breakthroughs, including automatic sampling, ascending from the moon without a launch site and an unmanned docking 400,000 kilometers above the lunar surface.
