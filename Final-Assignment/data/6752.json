Brian Schellman told the Associated Press. \n\nPolice believe teen made it inside the home on Thursday. However, there were no signs of forced entry and the door to the home was unlocked, authorities say. The suspect was with someone else who fled and was found shortly after. \n\nSchellman says a 4-year-old girl was also home. Neither she nor the 11-year-old boy were injured. \n\nThe children's mother was not home at the time of the shooting but is cooperating with the investigation. She told police she had purchased the gun for protection because of previous break-in attempts, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. \n\n\"It's troubling to say the least and shows that too many young people have access to handguns and the results are usually tragic,\" Schellman said in a statement. \n\nSharon Taylor, a relative of the boy, lives next door and says he is \"very respectful\" and not a problem child, though she doesn't believe the home-invasion account.\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
