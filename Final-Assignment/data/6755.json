Sure it is incredibly frustrating that many styles \u2013 particularly the classic pencil cut \u2013 don\u2019t come with pockets \u2013 but they are a truly versatile piece that can be dressed up and down. I thought I\u2019d put one to the challenge when I spent a week covering New Zealand Fashion Week 2015. Now it\u2019s important to know that I like to cover fashion weeks as a photographer rather than trying to get a seat as an attendee. I honestly feel like the best seats in the house are in the media riser where photographers clamour to get the outfit shots as models walk directly to the best light just in front of us. However in terms of dress code we are a pretty motley crew. The pit is still predominantly male and decked out in sneakers, jeans and if polo shirts \u2013 if they\u2019re fancy. For the most part it\u2019s crushed t-shirts, hoodies and scruffy\u00a0jeans. So if you enjoy dressing up in a male-dominated workplace, what are you to do? I advise incorporating dressier items into your work wardrobe and mixing them back in with \u201cthe standard\u201d pieces and always ensure that what you are wearing is practical. To this end \u2013 when I wore a pencil skirt, it was knit one that was stretchy enough to allow me to work unexpected situations like the time I had to sit cross-legged on the floor. The media riser at the Ruby show \u2013 that\u2019s me bottom left on the floor!

Now without further ado here\u2019s a look\u00a0to see three different ways I styled a pencil skirt for work: Look 1: Smart Casual for street style shooting with a chambray shirt and sneakers. Look 2: A relaxed Business Casual look with a bomber jacket and polished heeled loafers. Look 3: Business Casual with a blazer and heels. Elbow-length leather gloves were one of my favourite looks at the Kate Sylvester show and not just because I swear by my own! Losing the blazer for a night out, I may have even switched back to my sneakers for the dance floor ;) Outfit details: Skirt: Seed Heritage Women\u2019s Collection Crepe Fringe Midi Skirt\nDon\u2019t want the tassels?

So there you have it \u2013 three ways that I styled a pencil skirt for fashion week! I opted for a \u00a0knit one with fringing for a bit more fun but you can get this more simple one\u00a0too. Do you wear pencil skirts to the office? How do you style them for work?
