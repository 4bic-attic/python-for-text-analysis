Earlier this summer, protestors against the car service got violent as some vehicles were on the receiving end of some pretty substantial damage. The anger amongst the taxi community against the likes of Uber and Lyft is nothing new, but it looks like this ill-will is not going away anytime soon. \n \nDuring Thursday night\u2019s taping of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , a protestor in the audience allegedly made his presence known during Colbert\u2019s interview with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick . His message was clearly in support of New York City\u2019s taxi industry which is, in his words, being \u201cruined\u201d by the car service\u2019s business model. \n \nBuzzFeed\u2019s Rachell Zarrell was in attendance for the show and according to her update on Twitter , Colbert let the protestor talk: \n   \nAt Colbert, audience member started protesting the Uber CEO. Amazing how Colbert just let him speak. \n \n\u2014 Rachel Zarrell (@rachelzarrell) September 10, 2015 \n \n \n\n \nSince taking photo and video are strictly forbidden during tapings of The Late Show , we currently do not have any visual evidence of the outburst in question. There is\u00a0some time before the third episode of Colbert airs and it remains to be seen whether CBS will cut the outburst or include it in tonight\u2019s broadcast. Here\u2019s hoping the moment does make it to air, as Colbert seems to shine the most during unplanned incidents like these. \n \n(Via The Verge )", "source": "UPROXX \u00bb TV"}
