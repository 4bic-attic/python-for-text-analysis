He takes us forward, too. We have to play on the front foot more. \n\n\"We had a very young team against Swansea and the easy thing to do is go backwards. \n\n\"We've got to have a belief about us that we can go forward and create chances. We shouldn't be frightened about making a mistake. \n\n\"We've got a lot of young players learning their trade. Shaun Maloney can be that little bit of experience, which some of them will need. I'm sure he'll help Robbo (Andy Robertson), in particular.\" \n\nAgainst a Blackburn side who have won just one of their eight Championship fixtures to date, City will be favourites to continue their promotion bid with a victory tomorrow. \n\nGary Bowyer's men ended their search for a win when beating Charlton 3-0 last weekend, but they remain without an away victory since early April. \n\nBlackburn's visit will be City's fifth game in 15 days and recalls are expected for Michael Dawson, Mohamed Diame, Tom Huddlestone and Abel Hernandez.", "source": "Hull Daily Mail"}
