BACK IN THE GYM!!  \n 14 minutes ago BY TMZ STAFF   \nbreaking news \n \nGiants fans looking for a boost, look no further than this video of Jason Pierre-Paul -- ON HIS GRIND, in the gym, and apparently ... ready to bounce back from his horrific hand injury. \n  \nThe G-Men's former all-pro defensive end posted a video of himself running sprints with a sled strapped to his waist. Dude's hauling weight too ... about 270 pounds! \n \nIt's the first time JPP's been seen without a huge cast on his hand since 4th of July weekend, when he blew off at least one finger from his right hand in a firework accident. Hard to tell from the video if he's still sporting any bandages. \n \nSo, does this mean Jason's on the verge of a comeback? In the post he says, \"God can turn any situation around for the better. Your hard times will lead to the best times of your life. Don't believe the hype ... Be back soon! #90PC #ImAFighter #PutMeInCoach\" \n \n\u00a0And every Giants fan said, \"Amen!\" \u00a0Especially after Sunday night's disaster.", "source": "TMZ"}
