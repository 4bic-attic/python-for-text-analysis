She\u2019s flunking out of college, haunted by scandal, and the only person who cares is Sean Whitlow, an irresistible bad boy with a soft spot for her. The problem? He\u2019s her dead sister\u2019s ex. Sean doesn\u2019t bleed red, he bleeds motor oil. During the week, he struggles to turn his auto repair shop into a profitable business. But when Saturday night rolls around, he\u2019s the reigning stock-car king of the local race track. He doesn\u2019t know how to lose\u2013or how to walk away and leave Hannah alone with her grief.\nBetween her grades and her wealthy family\u2019s dark secrets, Hannah\u2019s barely holding her life together. And the last thing Sean needs is to get tangled up with another Casey girl. As the attraction between them spins out of control, they\u2019ll either find a love with no limits\u2013or go up in flames.
