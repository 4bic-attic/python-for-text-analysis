The victors did not mince words when explaining what the results meant: \"Catalans have voted yes to independence,\" said Artur Mas, the\u00a0veteran Catalan leader. \n \nLeaders of Junts pel Si (\"Together for Yes,\" in Catalan) \u2014 a coalition of pro-independence parties from both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 had framed Sunday's election as a plebiscite\u00a0on the region's future. Years of protests and an unofficial referendum \u00a0on the question of independence, though dismissed by Madrid, have generated real political momentum in Catalonia toward secession. \n \nThe region is the wealthiest in Spain, has its own distinct cultural and political history as well as\u00a0 longstanding grievances over various iterations of rule from Madrid. A delegation\u00a0of pro-independence Catalan politicians, speaking to WorldViews on a visit to Washington a few weeks prior\u00a0the elections, insisted their region had a right to control its own destiny, just like Denmark or Austria \u2014 European nation-states with populations of comparable size. \n \nThe regional elections on Sunday would dictate whether they had a\u00a0mandate to pursue, no matter the intransigence of Madrid. \n \n\"Spain will not be able to ignore a clear majority,\" said Roger Albinyana , then secretary for foreign affairs of Catalonia's Generalitat \u2014 the region's governing body that dates back to the 13th century. \n \nBut that's where the trouble for Catalonia's separatists begins. Junts pel Si did not win a clear majority. Combined with the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP),\u00a0a separate leftist party that also favors independence, the secessionist bloc commands enough seats to control Catalonia's regional government, but won less\u00a0than 50 percent of the actual vote. \n \nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, a conservative who is\u00a0adamantly opposed to any Catalonia independence bid,\u00a0cast the election result in a very different light than the separatists. \"Yesterday we saw the plurality of Catalonia,\" he told \u00a0reporters on Monday. \"Those who proposed to break us apart didn't have legal backing, or the backing of voters.\" \n \nRajoy has his own concerns ahead of national elections later this year and has maintained a staunchly Spanish nationalist position. Pablo Iglesias, the pony-tailed leader of Podemos, a leftist, anti-austerity party that's currently polling third in Spain, has said he would be willing to grant Catalonia its own\u00a0right to decide. \n \nCatalan pro-independence politicians look wistfully north to Scotland,\u00a0which was permitted to stage a referendum last year over the question of independence from Britain. The \"no\" camp won the day , but the process has since\u00a0transformed Scotland's once marginalized nationalists into a\u00a0political force in London. \n \nOn Monday, according to the Scotland Herald , officials in the Scottish government apparently\u00a0made the rather provocative\u00a0offer to help \"mediate\" between Barcelona and Madrid, given Scotland's own \"recent experience in a consensual referendum process.\" Doubtless, this is an overture the Spanish government won't take seriously. \n \nIn the absence of any constructive dialogue, Catalan pro-independence leaders\u00a0say they'll move toward building and reinforcing the de facto structures of an independent state over the next 18 months. This includes\u00a0the drafting of a constitution and the strengthening of various state agencies, such as\u00a0Catalonia's own missions overseas. \n \nThe concrete details, though, remain sketchy and\u00a0legal obstacles may further stymie such progress toward statehood. \n \nCatalonia generates nearly 20 percent of Spain's GDP and has objected to the draining of its tax revenues by the central government, especially since the catastrophic recession in 2008. Some economists , though not all , believe the region would be far better off on its own rather than tethered to the rest of Spain. \n \nThe pro-independence officials are at pains to stress that their politics are not based on\u00a0a narrow, traditional sense of ethno-nationalism \u2014\u00a0even though Catalans do take pride in their own language and cultural patrimony. \n \nRather, they champion a cosmopolitan, multicultural state with Barcelona as its capital, home to a majority of people who either themselves were born or whose parents were born outside of Catalonia. In his meeting with The Washington Post, Albinyana added that an independent\u00a0Catalan government would likely be more generous\u00a0in the face of the current refugee crisis gripping Europe, and would orient the focus of its foreign policy\u00a0more toward the Mediterranean and North Africa. \n \nWhatever the case, Catalonia's independence bid also exposes a curious wrinkle in the wider landscape of European politics. Catalonia's secessionists \u2014 with the exception of the far-left\u00a0CUP \u2014 also happen to be\u00a0firm\u00a0believers in the European Union and the larger project of a \"federal\" Europe .\u00a0The world view\u00a0is shared by\u00a0Scotland's nationalists, who were happy to belong to an integrated European economic and political superstructure, even as they sought\u00a0to end\u00a0their centuries-old union with London. \n \nThe irony is that this comes at a time of profound continental disillusionment with the European Union. Financial and political crises have exposed rifts between governments, while\u00a0right-wing, populist, Euroskeptic political parties are surging across parts of eastern and northern Europe. Britain may even hold its own referendum on whether it remains in the European Union next year. \n \nGiven the delicacy of the situation, neither technocrats in Brussels nor officials in other major European capitals are\u00a0likely\u00a0to lend any real\u00a0support to the Catalan nationalist cause. And so the secessionist camp will troop on, dreaming of a larger place in the world as it walks down a rather lonely path. \n \nIshaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.
