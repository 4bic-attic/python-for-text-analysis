The West Coast price fell 10 cents to $2.99 per gallon. The Midwest price decreased seven cents to $2.28 per gallon. The East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Rocky Mountain prices each declined five cents, to $2.26 per gallon, $2.09 per gallon, and $2.68 per gallon, respectively. Future Estimates: In August, U.S. retail regular gasoline prices averaged $2.64/gal. EIA expects monthly average prices to decline in the coming months as refineries continue to produce high levels of gasoline, as demand begins to decrease following the peak in the summer driving season, and as the market transitions to lower-cost winter-grade gasoline. EIA projects regular gasoline retail prices to average $2.11/gal in the fourth quarter of 2015. The U.S. regular gasoline retail price, which averaged $3.36/gal in 2014, is projected to average $2.41/gal in 2015 and $2.38/gal in 2016.
