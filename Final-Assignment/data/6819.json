Starting Oct. 6, patrons can order Egg McMuffins and other breakfast items at any time of the day. \n \nThe Oak Brook, Illinois-based company tweeted about the decision Tuesday afternoon using the hashtag #AllDayBreakfast and responding to customers' queries about extending the chain's breakfast hours. McDonald's even responded to a tweet from 2007 that said, \"Mcdonalds should serve breakfast 24/7.\" \n \nMcDonald's began testing all-day breakfast in March in the San Diego market . The test was expected to expand to Nashville this summer. \n \n\"Serving all-day breakfast is likely the number one request we hear from McDonald's customers,\"\u00a0the company told NBC\u00a0Chicago in a statement in July. \n \nMcDonald's breakfast currently ends at 10:30 a.m. in most markets. \n \nThe chain has long been the fast-food leader in the mornings, with its popular Sausage Biscuits, Hotcakes and other items pulling in roughly 20 percent of the company's U.S. sales. But McDonald's has faced stiffer competition in recent years, with competitors such as Starbucks and Subway rolling out breakfast sandwiches as well. \n \nPublished 4 minutes ago", "source": "NECN.com"}
