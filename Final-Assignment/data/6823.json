(Photo: Courtesy Toni Brooks) \n\nEarlier this month, Toni Brooks and Elizabeth San Nicolas launched Guamoji, Guam-inspired images for chatting through text messaging and social media. \n\nGuamoji, similar to emoji or Facebook stickers, each convey a unique idea, give quick shortcuts for communication. \n\n\u201cWell, we chat a lot; a lot,\u201d said Brooks, a freelance graphic designer. \u201cWe\u2019re always saying local phrases to each other.\u201d \n\n\u201cLike, we wish there was a sticker for that,\u201d said San Nicolas. \u201cSo we just made our own.\u201d \n\nThe first \u201cpackage\u201d includes 20 freely available Guamoji, which Brooks said captures many of Guam\u2019s \u201cwell-known icons.\u201d \n\nAmong them are a fiesta plate \u2014 complete with red rice and fina\u2019denne\u2019, as well as a flying proa, latte and donne peppers. \n\n\u201cIt started as a really fun project for our friends just to be hilarious and chat as we always are,\u201d said Brooks, \u201cand then we had this idea \u2014 \u2018Wait, hold on. Do you think people will buy this? Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\u201d \n\nEmoji made in Guam. \u00a0 (Photo: Courtesy Toni Brooks) \n\nBoth women have backgrounds in web development and design, and the Guamoji project allows them to bridge their tech backgrounds and their Chamorro roots. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you used text smilies way back in the day,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cAnd it just kinda evolves to the point where we need our own representation in that digital world.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re talking on this thing,\u201d added San Nicolas, holding up a cell phone. \u201cTime is of the essence, and less buttons to press is a good thing.\u201d \n\nAnd creating their own way of communicating, Brooks said, \u201cmakes it more personal.\u201d \n\nCurrently, users share Guamoji by copying them or saving them from an online library and pasting them into mobile chats. \n\nBrooks and San Nicolas said an actual keyboard application is in the works, which would allow for a much more streamlined interface. \n\nHowever, that will require tackling all the different requirements needed across the various platforms people would be sending Guamoji on. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest barrier is getting it implemented across different platforms,\u201d Brooks said, noting that the keyboard will also allow them to collect much more content-focused feedback. \n\nPreliminary feedback, she said though, has been mostly positive. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny and it\u2019s cute and it\u2019s, I dunno, really happy,\u201d she added. \n\nBrooks said they\u2019ve already started working with a Guam-native programmer in the states, who is helping develop the keyboard app. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s in demo phase now, so we\u2019re still working out the kinks,\u201d Brooks said. \n\nShe said once that\u2019s approved through the Apple App Store, they\u2019ll be ready for launch. \n\nTheir goal for that, she said, is Christmas. \n\n\u201cAnd then after that, after we get the iPhone app out, we\u2019ll start Android development,\u201d she said. \n\nIn addition to the app, Brooks and San Nicolas are also working on various themed \u201cpackages\u201d of Guamoji. \n\nFollowing Typhoon Soudelor, the duo designed and launched a pack of 20 typhoon-oriented Guamoji. \n\nThe pack sells for 99 cents on the Guamoji website with a portion of the proceeds going toward relief efforts in Saipan via the Ayuda Foundation. \n\nThe site uses a third-party app called \u201cCointent\u201d to process transactions, similar to PayPal. \n\nBrooks said the devastation in Saipan inspired the women to \u201cdo something.\u201d \n\n\u201cI guess this is our way of dealing,\u201d she said, \u201cthrough cute images.\u201d \n\nSan Nicolas noted that Guam is no stranger to the effects of typhoons. \n\n\u201cSo when the typhoon hit Saipan,\u201d she said, \u201cthe next pack, we didn\u2019t decide yet, so we decided \u2018OK, we\u2019ll do a typhoon one and help raise some money.\u201d \n\nThe typhoon pack includes a variety of Guamoji that focus particularly on storm preparation and includes images of batteries, generators and, Brooks\u2019 favorite, typhoon shutters. \n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s animated,\u201d she said. \n\nThe pair also has some theme packs lined up for release in the future. \n\nAmong them will be animal-themed package, featuring English and Chamorro names of Guam\u2019s creatures. \n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m really looking forward to creating those, because they\u2019re going to be so adorable,\u201d Brooks said. \n\nA local myths and legends package is slated for release next month, she added. \n\nBrooks and San Nicolas also said that for anybody looking to create their own art, there\u2019s a slew of resources available in Guam. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2015/09/25/guamoji-put-local-spin-mobile-chats/7254", "source": "Guam Pacific Daily News"}
