He led the Cowboys in forced fumbles (three) and quarterback hurries (five) while adding 3.5 sacks as a junior in 2014. Bean took some time this week to chat with ESPN.com about season goals, taking a redshirt season as a sophomore, and playing alongside Ogbah.\nWhat are some of your individual goals and team goals this season?\nJimmy Bean: My individual goals are private, but as far as team goals we want to be the best defense in the Big 12. We\u2019ve got to compete and prepare every week to do that.Jimmy Bean said part of his game preparation includes watching clips of some of the NFL's top pass-rushers.\u00a0AP Photo/Brandon Wade\nWhat is the key to doing that?\nJB: Turnovers and being able to dominate up front.\nIn terms of the defensive line, is one of the goals to be one of the best units in the Big 12?\nJB: Yeah. It\u2019s always going to be a team\u2019s goal on defense. Overall, as a team, we want to be the best at each position that we can be.\nI know you do a lot of different things for the defense. How do you feel about your overall role?\nJB: I\u2019m comfortable with my overall role. I\u2019m just here to be the best athlete I can and do my job every week.\nWhat was the biggest challenge about being asked to drop in the coverage and do so many different things?\nJB: It\u2019s gotten to a point with me where it\u2019s not much [of a challenge]. If I\u2019m asked, I\u2019d love to do it. All do anything he [OSU defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer] asks.\nDid it take a while to get comfortable?\nJB: At the beginning it did, but I caught up pretty fast.\nWhat\u2019s it like playing with Emmanuel?\nJB: It\u2019s great, he\u2019s a humble dude. It\u2019s fun to compete with him every day.\nDo you guys joke about racing each other to the quarterback?\nJB: Yeah. But it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s the entire defensive line. All the guys on the field, it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, who\u2019s going to get back there first?\u201d\nDo you feel overshadowed or overlooked with the attention he\u2019s gotten?\nJB: I don\u2019t feel overshadowed at all. I just do my job, do the best I can, to the best of my ability. And I think I\u2019ve done that.\nWas there a point where you realized you could play at this level?\nJB: Yeah. My first year coming off my medical [redshirt] I was real confident I could play at this level. They look big on film but once we get on the field they\u2019re the same size as me or the same size as the guys I go against in practice, so I\u2019m real comfortable going against anybody. I think that\u2019s when I realized it wasn\u2019t going to be too much for me.\nWas that tough, having to sit out a year after playing as a freshman? (Note: Bean was a medical redshirt as a sophomore after playing as a true freshman in 2011)\nJB: It was tough, but I knew it was time I needed to get strong and gain weight. When I played as a freshman I was just 220 pounds. A defensive lineman in the Big 12 is at least 250, 260.\nAre there any defensive ends you watch or model yourself after?\nJB: There\u2019s a few I watch and look up to. Every week before a game I watch their YouTube highlights. That\u2019s Tamba Hali, Justin Houston and Bruce Irvin. I watch what they do on the field and try to make my own version of it.\nWhat is it about them you like most?\nJB: They\u2019re relentless, good hands, good get-off the ball. Those are all things I try to put in my game.", "source": "ESPN.com - College Football Nation Blog"}
