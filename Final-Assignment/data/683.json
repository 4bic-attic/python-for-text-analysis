So there will come a slower time, yes. \n [embedded content] \n\u201cI\u2019m aware of my physicality as a man, as an actor and you can only do action movies for so long, and then it\u2019s time to bow out gracefully and let younger men do it. \n \n\u201cBut I think I can still run, I can still throw a punch, it remains to be seen\u2026\u201d \n \nHe added: \u201cWe are going to try and do a November Man 2. I got away with the last one and I think this next one, if everything goes to plan, will up the ante a little bit more, give it a bit of a sheen and just juice it up a little bit more.\u201d \n [embedded content] \nPierce stars alongside Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba in new romantic comedy Lessons In Love, which also stars 72-year-old Malcolm McDowell as his father. \n \nThe Mamma Mia! star said: \u201cMalcolm was a kick in the pants! He\u2019s actually as charming and reverent and naughty and as bold as the day he was born. He is a unique talent, from the landscape of thespians. I was very, very proud to work with him, that he wanted to work with me was an utter joy. \n \n\u201cI did say, \u2018Listen you\u2019re too young to be my father, this is crazy! But I don\u2019t care, if you want to do it, do it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \n   \n Share article  \n   \nLessons In Love is in cinemas now and available on demand courtesy of Arrow Films.", "source": "Didcot Herald"}
