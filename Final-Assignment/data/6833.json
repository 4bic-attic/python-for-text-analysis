There are better ways of dealing with illegal immigration, such as making life miserable and very costly for the employers who continue to hire them. They will go back when the jobs disappear!\u00a0 \n \nAlso, I do favor a modest legalization for some of the kids who are excelling in schools or wish to serve in the U.S. armed forces. \n And I favor the reenactment \u00a0of the \u201cbrasero\u201d program that was so effective in the 1950s.\u00a0It brought Mexicans here legally to work and they went home with their wages. For more on \u201cthe brasero\u201d program,\u00a0 read John Fund . \u00a0The brasero program was cancelled by Democrats pandering to the labor unions in the mid-60s.  \nNevertheless, the Mexican reaction to Trump\u2019s deportation idea takes me back to a time when I worked in Mexico. \n \nA few years ago, a U.S. company took advantage of my Spanish and sent me to Mexico.\u00a0It was a great experience. \u00a0 \n \nI recall going down to the Mexico consulate to fill out the paperwork. I had to prove that I wouldn\u2019t be a burden to Mexico,\u00a0It felt like I was applying for my first mortgage loan, specially given all of the economic information that I had to provide. \n Once in Mexico, our company attorney came by once a year and we filled out more paperwork.\u00a0It was to prove to the Mexican government that we paid our taxes, stayed out of trouble, and did not engage in political\u00a0activities, i.e.\u00a0 Article 33 of the Mexican Constitution \u00a0forbids foreigners from domestic politics. \u00a0 \u00a0  \nFurthermore, my business visa clearly said that I was to carry it with me just in case I had to prove that I was in the country legally. \n \nI recall our Mexican attorney discussing Article 67 with us: \n  Under Mexican law, Article 67 reads, \u201cAuthorities, whether federal, state or municipal, are required to demand that foreigners prove their legal presence in the country, before attending to any issues.\u201d\u201d\u00a0( via CNN )    \nAgain, I had a great time in Mexico.\u00a0Loved it.\u00a0I did not mind that I had to respect their immigration laws. After all, wasn\u2019t I a guest in their country? \n\nIt seemed totally logical to me that I had to respect their laws living in their country.\u00a0It never\u00a0occurred\u00a0to me\u00a0to march down the street with a U.S. flag complaining about Mexican laws! \n We read a recent story that Mexico\u00a0 now deports \u00a0more Central Americans than the U.S.:   Between October and April, Mexico apprehended 92,889 Central Americans. In the same time period, the United States detained 70,226 \u201cother than Mexican\u201d migrants, the vast majority from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.    \nMexico has a very tough policy against illegal immigration.\u00a0And there is nothing wrong with that! Every sovereign country has the right to decide who comes in and how long they stay.\u00a0Controlling your borders is the essence of sovereignty. \n \nIt\u2019s time for the U.S., and our elected officials, to defend our right to have immigration laws.\u00a0And to say so publicly! \u00a0I fear that our wimpy political class, intoxicated with a heavy dose of PC, is too quiet about the U.S.\u2019s right and duty to protect its borders. \n \nAs a legal immigrant, and naturalized citizen, I understand the contributions that we\u2019ve made to the U.S. At the same time, let\u2019s get serious about immigration laws and their usefulness in the real world.", "source": "Before Its News"}
