Military was told not to save the Benghazi compound and ignore Americans getting killed. Now they're doing the same here. Obama admin. giving orders to US troops to not do anything about Afghan soldiers molesting young boys. \n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/world/asia/us-soldiers-told-to-ignore-afghan-allies-abuse-of-boys.html?_r=2&referrer\n\nIt's obvious the Obama admin. gave that order. Who else would it be? The President is in charge of the troops to begin with. The Qur'an permits and encourages Muslims molesting children so that's probably why Obama is permitting them to do it. \n\nKev", "source": "K'Brocking"}
