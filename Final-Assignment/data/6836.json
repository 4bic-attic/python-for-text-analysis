The five-year compound annual growth rate is flat at 1.0% and revenues will only increase to $50.4 billion by 2020, according to a new report by Ambient Insight called \" The  2015-2020 Worldwide Self-paced eLearning Market .\" \n \nFive-year regional forecasts for three types of eLearning products are provided for seven regions: Africa , Asia Pacific , Eastern Europe , Latin America , the Middle East , North America , and Western Europe . Five-year revenue forecasts and market analyses are provided for 120 countries in this report. This is the most comprehensive and detailed eLearning report ever published. \n \nRead the Executive Overview here: \n\n \nhttp://www.ambientinsight.com/Reports/eLearning.aspx \n \nAfrica has the highest growth rate at 16.3% and eLearning revenues will reach over a billion dollars in that region by 2020. Revenues will more than double in seventeen of the twenty-nine countries in Africa by 2020. \n \nThroughout the forecast period, the top buying countries are the US, China , Canada , South Korea , and India . The US is the largest eLearning market in the world by a wide margin, yet the growth rate in the US is now slightly negative at -0.9%, the first time the US eLearning market has entered negative territory in the history of the industry. Nevertheless, the high revenues in the US will remain steady throughout the forecast period. \n \n\"This is the first time in the eleven years that we have been publishing the global eLearning market reports that we have revised our forecasts downward. Low growth rates are now common in early adopter countries,\" comments Adkins. \"Twenty of the countries analyzed in this report have flat-to-negative growth rates; most are early adopter countries where suppliers are competing solely on price in highly-commoditized markets. In a commodity market, demand is still high, but pricing power is weak.\" \n \nThe flat global growth rate masks the phenomenal growth in dozens of countries. In fact, eLearning revenues will more than double in 49 of the 120 countries analyzed in this report; the majority of these countries are developing economies. \n \nThe top twenty countries with the highest eLearning growth rates in the world are Laos , Thailand , Uganda , Cambodia , Ghana , Rwanda , Mongolia , Myanmar , Senegal , Nepal , the Dominican Republic , Kenya , Honduras , Sri Lanka , Vietnam , Ethiopia , El Salvador , Tanzania , Zambia , and Bangladesh ; nine out of twenty are in the Asia Pacific region and eight are in Africa . The other three are in Latin America . Eight of the top twenty have growth rates above 40%. \n \n\"The astonishing growth rates and adoption rates in countries like Laos , Thailand , Uganda , Cambodia , and Ghana are good examples of once nascent markets that became vibrant revenue opportunities for suppliers in just the last two years, literally overnight in the context of a learning technology product lifecycle,\" adds Adkins. \n \nThe supply-side section provides regional revenue forecasts for three types of eLearning products and services including: retail packaged content, custom content development services, and authoring tools/platforms. \n \n\"The flat overall growth rate for the global market is due to flat-to-negative growth rates in the US, thirteen countries in Western Europe , and six countries in Asia Pacific ,\" adds Adkins. \"The growth rate for eLearning in North America is now negative, being dampened by the weakness in the US market. Western Europe and Asia Pacific have flat growth rates below 2%.\" \n \nMedia Contact:  Sam Adkins , Ambient Insight, 360-805-4298, sam@ambientinsight.com  \n \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com  \n \nSOURCE  Ambient Insight \n \nCopyright 2014 PR Newswire.
