However, once Wale and Metro Boomin settled on the direction of the song, it was almost as if they completely forgot about the crowd, experimenting without reservation. The Highbridge Voices choir brought an additional layer to the experience, adding haunting harmonizations to Metro\u2019s production. \n \n\n \nWatch how the track was created below. \n \n\n \nThe post Wale \u2013 \u2018Voices In My Head\u2019 ft.
