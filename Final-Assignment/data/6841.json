At cornerback, Alterraun Verner was working with the second-team defense on Friday, which suggests that veteran Tim Jennings -- who got 53 snaps Sunday to Verner's 36 -- will step in and get his first start with the Bucs as well. \n \nTight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins (shoulder) and safety Major Wright (abdomen) haven't practiced all week, so they're all but officially out for Sunday. Chris Conte, who had an interception and forced fumble against the Saints, is expected to start again at safety, with Luke Stocker, Brandon Myers and Cameron Brate all getting more work to help offset Seferian-Jenkins' absence.", "source": "St. Petersburg Times"}
