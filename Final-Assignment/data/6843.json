The parrot was found perched on the Jaya Vijayulu statues near the sanctum sanctorum. The temple staffers were able to catch the parrot and release it outside. \n\nTemple officials said they felt the parrot was a representative of \u00a0Andal Ammavaru. Its appearance on the day a garland sent from the Srivilliputhur was offered to Lord Balaji and the processional deity in Mohini avatar was very auspicious. \n\nThe 15-foot-long Andal mala was sent by Srivilliputhur temple administration of Tamil Nadu which was offered by the Pedda Jeeyar of Tirumala on Saturday. The garland adorned the presiding deity and processional deity on Sunday, as is the age-old practice.", "source": "Deccan Chronicle"}
