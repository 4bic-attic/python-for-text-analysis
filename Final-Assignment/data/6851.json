Whatever the solution it is simply not credible to keep asserting that needs will be met by continued efficiency savings \u2013 this is a wake-up call.\u201d \n \nBut prime minister and Witney MP David Cameron said: \u201cI recognise the pressure on our doctors and nurses but I don\u2019t think that this is just about finding more money. \n \n\u201cWe have committed an unprecedented \u00a310bn increase above inflation for the NHS, balanced by efficiencies delivered as set out in the NHS\u2019s own strategy \u2013 the Five Year Forward View. This will involve changing the way that care is delivered in many of the ways that Sir Jonathan describes - such as better coordination of services.\u201d \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe county\u2019s other MPs have not yet responded after being asked for their views.", "source": "Banbury Cake"}
