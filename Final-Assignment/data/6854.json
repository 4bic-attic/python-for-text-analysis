This increases the risk of fractures. Osteoporosis mainly affects women, but can also affect men. In women, bone loss occurs very rapidly in the first few years after menopause and continues through the postmenopausal stage. Osteoporosis progresses when\n\nbone resorption occurs too quickly or when replacement occurs too slowly. Risk factors for osteoporosis that cannot be controlled include gender, age, body size (low body weight), ethnicity, and family history. Risk factors that can be controlled include sex hormones, medication use, calcium and vitamin intake, alcohol intake, and smoking. Analysts recognise the following companies as the key players in the Osteoporosis Drugs Market in BRIC Nations: Amgen, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novartis Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Abiogen Pharma, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, IMMD, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Pantarhei Bioscience, Pfizer, PhytoHealth, Radius Health, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and Zosano Pharma. The treatment paradigm of osteoporosis has been stationary for the past few decades. This will likely change with the launch of anabolic agents in BRIC countries, which are currently in the late and mid-stages of development. The launch of new efficacious and safe anabolic treatments will be the major modification in the management of osteoporosis. By directly stimulating bone formation, anabolic agents restrict the incidence of fractures by increasing bone mass.\" According to analysts, Aging is a known risk factor for osteoporosis and associated fractures. Osteoporosis is one of the major public health issues in BRIC countries, particularly among people aged 50 and above. The improved standards of healthcare facilities and sophisticated treatment options have resulted in higher life expectancy rates, leading to an increased aging population. Further, analysts state that an inadequate number, high cost, and limited availability of DXA systems restrict the diagnosis of people with osteoporosis. - Eli Lilly Other prominent vendors - Abiogen Pharma - Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals - F.
