He didn\u2019t specify which provisions. \n \nGelblung said,\u00a0\u201cMaterials on sale offend the memory of Hitler\u2019s victims and provoke violence against Jewish communities throughout Latin America.\u201d \n \n\u201cCosta Rica\u2019s long support for Israel and its well-established Jewish community require the immediate removal of this anti-Semitic emporium,\u201d the organization stated. \n \nMinister S\u00e1nchez\u00a0confirmed that the Justice Ministry had\u00a0received the petition last Sept. 2 in an email from the Simon Wiesenthal Center\u2019s branch office in Buenos Aires, Argentina. \n \nS\u00e1nchez said her office\u00a0submitted the request to government\u00a0prosecutors\u00a0so that they can\u00a0determine\u00a0whether there are grounds to proceed with a criminal case. \n \nOn Wednesday the Prosecutors\u2019 Office said\u00a0they had not received any request from the Justice Ministry regarding the business or its owner. \n \nThe Economy Ministry, through its press office, also\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday that it had\u00a0not\u00a0received any petition to close the business and that, in any case, it had no power to do so\u00a0unless the business is a tax debtor or dodger. \n \nSteven Ferris, a San Jos\u00e9 lawyer and board member of The Tico Times\u2019 parent company, said currently there are no specific laws in Costa Rica banning\u00a0the sale or purchase of Nazi\u00a0or anti-Semitic merchandise, therefore there appear to be\u00a0no grounds for prosecuting the business owner. \n Shop owner: It\u2019s a private collection  \nThe shop\u2019s owner, Minor Blanco Villalobos, told The Tico Times his business was being targeted by\u00a0a person who entered the store,\u00a0took pictures of some of the\u00a0German army and other Nazi objects and sent them to the\u00a0Wiesenthal Center. \n \nBlanco, who said he has master\u2019s degrees in history and arts, said collectors from other countries often contact him to value antiques. \n \n\u201cThe [Nazi] objects\u00a0belong to an Italian collector from Verona who also has businesses in Costa Rica,\u201d Blanco said. \u201cHe asked me to verify and value them. That\u2019s the reason why these objects\u00a0were on my shop. I\u2019ve received requests to value and sell objects ranging from Mayan spearheads to Etruscan art pieces.\u201d \n \nHe denied the collection includes concentration camp prisoners\u2019 clothing or\u00a0Holocaust denial books.\u00a0He said it\u00a0only includes\u00a0military uniforms and said the books are German political books written before Hitler\u2019s time as dictator, even before \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d he explained. \n \nBlanco said his shop mostly offers traditional antique\u00a0objects: old coins, bank notes, books, toys, furniture,\u00a0archaeological artifacts, pictures, sculptures, religious art and old Tico memorabilia. Blanco\u00a0also owns military collectibles from the U.S., Japan, Italy, France and\u00a0as well as some\u00a0World War II items. \n \nThe shop owner said the bad publicity from the\u00a0Wiesenthal Center\u00a0had forced him to remove all the Nazi items from his store to avoid problems.\u00a0\u201cPeople in recent\u00a0days contacted\u00a0me through email and social media and told me some groups are commenting on at least two social media profiles about\u00a0visiting my business to protest or even worse \u2026 and now I have to be extremely cautious to avoid attacks to my property,\u201d he said. \n \nBlanco\u00a0said his store\u00a0will remain\u00a0open and that he only closed it for a few days this week to reorganize the objects on display, after removing the German collection. \n   \nThe shop\u2019s collection also includes traditional antiques such as Matroska dolls, archaeological artifacts and even religious art. \n \n(Courtesy of Caza de Tesoros)", "source": "TicoTimes.net"}
