The project, part of its\u00a0Five Year Forward Review, hopes to develop promising ideas about integrating health into communities and building-in digital care and monitoring to help them become established across England\u2019s 200,000 homes a year output.\u00a0 The project was announced last week by Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, with expressions of interest from promoters and landowners sought by September 30. The five selected projects will be revealed in the autumn. The five will be offered a package of support and expertise, with NHS England paying for consultancy advice and upfront development work, although it also hopes to act as a broker to leverage support from existing project partners such as BT Health.\u00a0 Three ongoing schemes have already indicated that they hope to take part: Old Oak Common in west London; Grosvenor Estate\u2019s Barton Park in Oxford; and Taylor Wimpey\u2019s Cranbrook in east Devon. Taylor Wimpey\u2019s Cranbrook in east Devon A spokesman said that NHS England could offer design and clinical expertise to a project seeking to develop a well-being centre, and was \u201cdefinitely supportive\u201d of embedded digital technologies. \u201cWe want to use this as a test bed on innovations in embedded technology and active monitoring, or facilitating virtual consultations. In the US, we know that a lot more healthcare is being run through technology,\u201d said the spokesman. \u201cOne of the reasons we want to do this is we feel this thinking is not mainstreamed enough, so that\u2019s the longer term objective.\u201d Other examples of ideas it wants to support include: creating communities that support social cohesion, physical and mental well-being, walking, cycling and sports in place of current \u201cobesogenic\u201d built environments; designing-in the use of new digital technologies to help people live independently in their own homes; sharing land and buildings infrastructure such as new NHS clinics, schools, police and fire stations and other public services. Stevens said: \u201cThis country needs a big expansion in affordable new house building, but as we do so, let\u2019s future-proof our new communities for the health and care challenges of this new century \u2013 obesity, dementia, new models of digital health. \u201cWe want to work together with local councils and others to design and develop new town partnerships that put innovative health and social care practice at the very heart of urban planning to create healthier places to live from the outset. \u201cIn practical terms that means a triple agenda: designing-in healthy living, capitalising on new home-based care and technologies to support older people at home, and sharing infrastructure across public services to make smarter use of taxpayers investment.\u201d Construction Manager - News\nThis was taken up by the national mainstream press:\nNHS should help implement 'radical changes' in town planning to keep us fit, says health chief\nResearch found people who live in areas with less green space are less active\nCHARLIE COOPER HEALTH CORRESPONDENT Sunday 05 July 2015\nThe NHS should help to redesign our towns and cities in order to safeguard the nation\u2019s health, the chief executive of the health service in England has said.\nSimon Stevens, who has described the NHS as \u201ca social movement\u201d as well as a health service, said that it can no longer just \u201cpick up the pieces\u201d after illness strikes, but should play an active role in prevention \u2013 even at the level of town planning and architecture.\nHealth experts said \u201cradical changes\u201d were necessary after years of towns and cities being designed in a way that encouraged sedentary behaviour.\nLast week, health officials issued a formal invitation to developers, housing associations and local authorities to apply for NHS support \u2013 including expert advice and, potentially, funding \u2013 for five new housing developments of up to 10,000 homes, which they hope will become national exemplars of how house design, infrastructure and street planning can encourage healthy lifestyles.\nNHS boss Simon Stevens has identified prevention as a key way to drive down demand on the NHS (PA)\nOfficials are anticipating interest from new towns such as Cranbrook and Sherford in Devon, and areas where major new developments are about to take place, such as Old Oak Common in north-west London.\nNHS should help implement 'radical changes' in town planning to keep us fit, says health chief - Health News - Health & Families - The Independent\nIt is clear that good design can impact radically on health outcomes:\nFutures Forum: Designing places for healthier lives\nFutures Forum: Greener, healthier and more humane cities\nFutures Forum: Community-led design from the Glass House\nFutures Forum: Landscaping for Health\nFutures Forum: Active by Design ....... finding new ways to connect our planning system, health services and the built environment\nFutures Forum: Trees reduce pollution\nHowever, there are serious doubts that design is a priority in Cranbrook:\nFutures Forum: Cranbrook: welcome to dismaland\nFutures Forum: Cranbrook: where's the 'good design'?\nThe Sunday Times recently highlighted the gap between the hype and the reality:\nCRANBROOK TO BECOME A \u201cHEALTH TOWN\u201d TO CUT NHS BURDEN?\n20 AUGUST 2015\nThe head of the NHS has had this bright idea and Cranbrook is mentioned as a possible pilot town.\nThe chosen towns will emphasise active travel, parks, table tennis, more sheltered housing for elderly people, mobile and accessible health services, no fast food restaurants close to schools, GP monitored technology in homes, no kerbs, non- slip pavements and symbolic signs to help dementia sufferers.\nGood luck with that one, with a fish and chip shop opening near the school and a row already going on about the school playing fields having no floodlighting making it inaccessible at night and cars parked half-on kerbs because there isn\u2019t enough parking. Not to mention \u2013 so far \u2013 zero provision for specialist housing for the elderly.\nThe article mentions that Cranbrook is expected to have 20,000 new homes which seems to imply that all the 17,100 homes claimed as being required in the Local Plan will be sited there along with another 3,000 for good measure.\nSource: Sunday Times 30/8/15, page 15\nCranbrook to become a \u201chealth town\u201d to cut NHS burden? | East Devon Watch\nAnd whilst Cranbrook has had its first baby\nCranbrook: how to create a new town with an old sense of community | Exeter Express and Echo\n...\u00a0a County Council\u00a0committee\u00a0has raised real questions as to how the new town is developing - and has made several recommendations, including:\nPlace Scrutiny Committee\n11 September 2015\n5: To establish a strategic health and wellbeing group as a matter of urgency which oversees the development of a health and wellbeing strategy for Cranbrook, including representatives from all strands of the community, including lead county councillors, public health, social care and the Cranbrook Town Council.\nPlace Scrutiny () - Fri Sep 11 2015\nThis has been covered by today's Express & Echo:\nReport finds that Cranbrook is not yet \u2018future proof\u2019\nBy Exeter Express and Echo | Posted: September 14, 2015 A NEW report has found that Cranbrook is not yet \u201cfuture proof\u201d, as there is no provision of bungalows, retirement homes, extra care housing and nursing homes for older residents.\nThe problem was highlighted in findings from a review by a county council task force.\nThe task group\u2019s report states that \u201ca huge amount has been achieved\u201d since building work began at Cranbrook in June 2011.\u00a0Cranbrook held its first elections in May and it now has its own Town Council to serve its estimated current population of around 2,500 people living in just over 1,000 homes.\nThe reports states that although the Cranbrook Medical Centre opened in April 2015, there was a \u201ccomplete lack of healthcare, social care or other professional support during the first 18-24 months\u201d.\nThe GP surgery will need a larger premises in future to have sufficient capacity for the town\u2019s expanding population.

Can you BELIEVE the developers, officers and councillors didn\u2019t see any of these major flaws? Or was it just a rush for maximum profits as fast as possible to take advantage of government sweeteners? AND Councillor Moulding (with his EDDC councillor hat on) was around the whole time but now criticises the project with his DCC hat on? You could not make it up! AND it seems Mr Cohen may have been too busy on the Knowle project to notice, too!\nEast Devon Watch\n.\n.\n.", "source": "Futures Forum"}
