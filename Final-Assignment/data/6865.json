This September marks the 5,000th meal donated through JAACF to St. Luke\u2019s VNA Hospice, Bethlehem, and Agentis has asked loyal donor restaurants to commemorate the milestone by teaming together and donating in tandem. \n\n\u00a0On Thursday, September 3, The Apollo Grill donated a feast of its signature dishes, including seared tuna; grilled asparagus; Apollo Waldorf Salad; Brie, Pear and Tricolore Salad; Beef Tips with Udon Noodles; and Sesame-Crusted Tuna Sashimi\u2014plus a bounty of signature salads and sides, a smoked salmon sushi, and an array of desserts. \n\nMeanwhile, staff and owners from Yianni\u2019s  Taverna were on hand to assist in setting up and serving, and their donation of giant trays of Pasticcio , a Greek comfort food of pasta, cream and meats, and an enormous crisp, colorful Greek salad proved to be a welcome sight for families traveling from as far away as Florida and the Chicago area to be with loved ones. \n\n\u00a0\u201cThe list of donor partners has grown to 62 area restaurants, and these are some of the finest businesses in the Lehigh Valley,\u201d observes Agentis . \u00a0He adds, \u201cAfter a business donates for the first time, they often ask, when our business can donate again?\u201d \n\nLoyal donor restaurants include: The Apollo Grill, Corked Steak and Wine Bar, Edge, The Mint Gastropub , The Hamilton Kitchen and Bar, Tapas on Main, Shula\u2019s Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill, Panera Bread, and Yianni\u2019s  Taverna . (Attached please find a full list of participating restaurants.) \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The families visiting loved ones at hospice are more than grateful for the delicious meal, and have expressed their appreciation in donations, thank-you cards and well wishes weeks later on Facebook . \n\nAgentis and the JAACF earned the Heart of Hospice Award from the Pennsylvania Hospice Network, 2014, and the Shining Star Award from St. Luke\u2019s Health Network, 2014. The nonprofit also recently earned a grant from Just Born, Inc. \n\nDyanne Holt, a co-owner of Apollo Grill, says, \u201cThis is a notable charitable foundation with an excellent mission. The foundation recognizes the need that family members here at hospice need to nourish the whole body and soul. Providing fine food is one way to help them do that.\u201d \n\n\u201cHospice is important; they help make you ready and help make your loved one comfortable,\u201d adds Holt, who has experienced having two of her own family members in hospice. \n\nFor more information about the JAACF, established to provide meals to hospice centers and to provide testing,\u00a0early\u00a0detection, awareness and education about\u00a0Pancreatic and Liver and Colon\u00a0Cancers,\u00a0visit www .JAACF. org , Facebook /JAACF or Twitter @JAACF org . \n\n#### \n\nContact Info: \n\nJAACF \nP.O.
