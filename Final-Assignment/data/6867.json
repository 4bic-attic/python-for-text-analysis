He has experience of playing in France (and Europe) with Toulon and is at the top of his game.\n\nThe Aussies have realised how key he is by changing their rigid selection policy and picking him from a team outside of Australia.\n\nCoach co-ordinator at Gosport & Fareham, Simon Burns\n\nEverybody will start off with New Zealand as favourites but the southern-hemisphere sides are renowned for not travelling very well.\n\nFor that part, I think it will be between England and France.\n\nFrance may well come good \u2013 they had a good game when they were up against a supposedly semi-reasonable England side and beat them comfortably.\n\nBut if you take England and the way they performed against Ireland, it is looking good for them.\n\nThey have real strength in depth and I think Stuart Lancaster has picked the right players.\n\nIn terms of expectation levels, with England, you are speaking about professional players who week in, week out are under pressure so there are no excuses on that front.\n\nThe only downfall for England is that they are a young side. Will they have that experience? Only time will tell as they grow into the competition.\n\nThere are forwards playing exceptionally well and Jonathan Joseph has had a couple of outastanding games so the pack is looking strong.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Sam Burgess gets on. \n\nI like how he plays at Bath in the back row but he has still got that Rugby League mentality in the way that he carries the ball.\n\nJust for the experience would I put him in? Of course I would.\n\nBut will he get a starting slot when they get to the later stages?\n\nI doubt it but I would have him on the bench to bring on as a wrecking ball.\n\nThe hits he puts in are just amazing.\n\nAs far as interest outside of the home nations lies, it would be nice to see USA have a good World Cup.\n\nThey are still coming into the sport and the fact they are based at United Services Portsmouth, it would be nice to see them progress to say we looked after them as a city and things like that.\n\nAs for individuals, I\u2019d like Jacques Burger to go well for Namibia \u2013 it is great to see these players playing for their home nations on the biggest stage of all.\n\nHampshire coach, Ian Chandler\n\nI think the teams to beat will be South Africa or New Zealand. \n\nSouth Africa because of the physicality and sheer size of their forwards, which gives them a chance in any one-off game \u2013 they know how to win.\n\nNew Zealand because their squad of 31 players is he best on paper \u2013 they will take nations apart.\n\nThey have been there, seen it, done it and know what to expect \u2013 it\u2019s not a surprise so that will be a major part.\n\nIf you are a betting man, then England would be the smart money at slightly longer odds. That\u2019s as long as they win their group.\n\nIf they don\u2019t win their group and all else goes to plan, then as runners-up they would have to beat South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nIf you do that then you deserve to win it.\n\nThey have got the players to do it \u2013 it is all on the day.\n\nAs far as England personnel is concerned, I think Sam Burgess is a surprise with his lack of experience at international rugby level.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting his qualities as an individual, but is he a game winner in union? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have picked him.\n\nI would have stuck with tried and trusted at this level.\n\nI would have taken Danny Cipriani because he can play in multiple positions. \n\nBurgess would have been left out for him for me, because Owen Farrell can also play in the centre if needs be. \n\nFellow fly-half George Ford from England could be the star of the tournament.\n\nHe has got everything \u2013 the boy can really play, he has just got to take the shackles off.\n\nIf England\u2019s line-out functions and gives him some ball then he can create big holes.\n\nElsewhere, Jonathan Joseph is one of a talented group of England backs.\n\nThe old addage goes if you can beat people with pace then there\u2019s no substitute for it. They (Joseph & Co) have got the wow factor.", "source": "Portsmouth Today"}
