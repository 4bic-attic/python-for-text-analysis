There are multiple reports on Twitter about people being charged around \u00a3235 yesterday (five times the game\u2019s price) despite ordering only one copy. GAME responded quickly on Twitter and said that customers affected by this would get\u00a0 a refund within 24 hours. However, it seems like the issue was not fully resolved as this morning, at least one person claims to have been charged an additional two times, for a total of seven times the game\u2019s original price.
