When I was 9 years old, I saw the movie, The Last Waltz, about THE BAND\u2019s final concert. Seeing Robbie and Clapton made me want to become a lead guitarist. For this movie, Robbie Robertson had his guitar dipped in bronze, which I thought looked so cool. Every time I see it, it brings back the same feelings I had the first time I saw The Last Waltz, and dreamed of being a lead guitarist.\nI wanted to have a replica of this guitar, so I asked Warmoth if they could do it. Christina Hudson wrote me back saying they would be happy to. Aaron Cheney wanted to do it for free, and my buddy, Jeff Kiesel at Carvin, gave the okay.\nChristina first tried to find some guitar painters who could make it look just like bronze, but she finally thought that we should have it dipped in bronze, just like Robbie had done. She found a place that Robbie\u2019s son had used to bronze his guitar. It looked exactly right!\nChristina and Warmoth nailed every detail; the bronze body, the middle and bridge pickups put together, and the Telecaster knobs on a Strat.\nThanks to my friend, Brian Acuff, I had the neck already.\nI can\u2019t thank Warmoth enough for this beautiful gift, which brings back the great memories of when I first fell in love with the electric guitar. I also thank my awesome guitar company, Kiesel Guitars Carvin Guitars, for letting Warmoth do this for me.", "source": "Truth In Shredding"}
