Our return procedure is already one of the fastest in the country. In the last two months, we have extended this further by piloting the IMPS refunds program, which has seen positive adoption and traction from our end users,\u201d Punit Soni, chief product officer-Flipkart said. \n \nThe CoD IMPS return facility is currently active for banks having IMPS transaction capability. \n \n\u201cEntitled customers will be regularly notified about the status of their refund via SMS and emails. Earlier, the refund process used to take three to five business days, causing customer discomfort,\u201d it added. \n \n\u201cThis is a huge step in the payments front and has a big impact in the way customers shop on Flipkart. An instant, hassle-free refund experience, combined with consistent and accurate communication to the customer is definitely going to be a breakthrough, and a way forward for all future payment innovations,\u201d Soni added. \n \n\u201cTransactions on IMPS can be accessed and initiated across different channels such as mobile, internet, NUUP, ATM and at bank branches. More than 12 million successful transactions are been processed every month,\u201d Dilip Asbe, chief operating officer, NPCI said.", "source": "DQ Channels"}
