Whether you\u2019re giving new life to a historic treasure or simply sprucing up a more modern home, there are many ways to retain features that keep the integrity of the original design intact while keeping your renovation budget under control. Heating and cooling systems: Adding a temperature control system to a home or considering how to integrate an addition into an existing system can be a daunting proposition. In those cases, not only is a ductless system one of the easiest options for improved home comfort, it also preserves the existing structure and architectural integrity of a home. Installing a ductless system, such as those offered by Mitsubishi Electric Cooling & Heating, is a simple solution for eliminating window units and baseboard heaters that detract from the beauty and architectural essence of your home. There\u2019s no need to tear through or lower ceilings to make space for ducts and no messy demolition is required. Kitchen and bath: Two rooms that see the greatest attention in home makeovers are the kitchen and bath, and they\u2019re also commonly the most expensive. In some cases, updates are truly necessary to keep pace with matters like modern plumbing. But before you make plans to gut a room, consider how you might repurpose the existing contents to fit your needs. In the kitchen, you may be surprised by how sanding and staining or painting the existing cabinetry transforms the space. Remember that lightly colored cabinets and countertops will make a small kitchen space feel larger, and you can bring pops of color into the room with the backsplash and decor. Especially if you\u2019re rehabbing an older home, you may find a bath without a shower. In most cases, it\u2019s actually fairly simple to convert a claw-foot tub with some plumbing improvements and the addition of a shower curtain. Tired tile and grout may simply need a thorough cleaning or you may be able to add paint for a fresh look. \u2014 Family Features HOME-SELLING TIP Your front door is one of the first ways you can make a good impression on people interested in buying your abode. Take a good look at your door and see what fixes need to be made. If your door is still in nice shape, it may just take a good coat of paint and some new fixtures to make it sparkle. Double-check the screen, and replace it if need be. You also want to spruce up the area around your front door: Some nice potted plants can make a big difference in the look of your entryway.

The dingy carpet you can\u2019t wait to tear out may actually be covering a hidden gem: original hardwood floors. Many homeowners rush to rip out old flooring at the first sign of damage, HGTV\u2019s Nicole Curtis says. Her advice: approach your renovation with a \u201cwhat can I save\u201d rather than a \u201cwhat can I lose\u201d mentality. Damaged sections of wood flooring can be patched using reclaimed wood from other parts of the house or even the attic. \u2014 More Content Now GARDEN GUIDE Ready to get planting in your yard? Get the ground prepped by improving your soil. Begin by digging up your current garden soil to a depth of at least 10 inches, breaking up clumps of dirt and getting rid of rocks as you work. Next, you\u2019ll want to spread about 6 inches of compost over the area you\u2019re planning on planting on. Finish things up by raking the soil until it\u2019s level. Voila: You\u2019re ready! \u2014 More Content Now", "source": "Wicked Local Lexington"}
