The downturn this year could be as much as 4.3 percent, it said. \n \n\u201cThis will accelerate an already troubling rise in the poverty rate,\u201d said the bank\u2019s country director for Russia, Andras Horvai. \n \nThe Bank ditched its earlier forecast of a gentle recovery with 0.7-percent growth in 2016. It now expects Russian economic output to decline 0.6 percent next year, with a recovery only appearing in 2017 with growth of 1.5 percent. \n \n\u201cThe recession is having a severe impact on households as double-digit inflation erodes real wages and incomes,\u201d the World Bank said, citing \u201csharply increasing\u201d poverty rates. \n \n\u201cThe current recession is expected to reverse recent progress in poverty reduction and threatens shared prosperity achievements of the last decade,\u201d the Bank said, referring to trends regularly hailed by Russia as major achievements of President Vladimir Putin. \n \nRussia experienced a \u201cdramatic contraction in real wages and income\u201d in the first half of 2015, especially for public sector workers whose real wages fell by 10 percent, according to the Bank\u2019s report. \n \nAs a result, the poverty rate has climbed to 15.1 percent, representing 21.7 million people, in what World Bank called a \u201ctroubling rise\u201d exacerbated by increasing food prices. \n \nIn some regions, more than 35 percent of the population live in poverty, it said. \n \nThe World Bank forecasts assume Western sanctions remain in place. \n \nRussia\u2019s central bank this month predicted a greater contraction of between 3.9 percent and 4.4 percent in 2015. \n \nConsumer prices in August were up 15.8 percent year on year, the state statistics service said this month. \n \nThe government is struggling to keep the Russian currency afloat but the current interest rate of 11 percent is too high to kick-start the economy. \n \nAs oil prices plunged this summer, the ruble fell 20 percent against the dollar, reaching its lowest level this year in August and pushing up consumer prices. \n \n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "Eyethu News"}
