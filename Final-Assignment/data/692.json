(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \n\nWILMINGTON With mourners still gathering to grieve the loss of Thomas \u201cCannibal\u201d Cottingham, who was stabbed in Rodney Square on Monday as he intervened to protect a mother and her child as they were being chased by a man with a knife, police officers launched a campaign for a more visible law enforcement presence in the square on Friday. \n\nThe New Castle County Police brought out their mounted patrol to be stationed in the square, the heart of the city\u2019s central business district, and Wilmington police officers patroled on bikes and in marked cars. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about combating crime, this is about making people feel safe,\u201d said Col. Elmer Setting, pointing to the six officers on horseback that lined the green Friday morning. \n\nSetting said the county has also launched a mobile patrol unit in Wilmington to bolster the efforts of the city department, but residents and those who were walking around the area on their lunch break seemed drawn to the mounted patrol, coming up to pet the large Clydesdales and snap a photo. \n\n\u201cFor the kids it is just fun,\u201d said Sheila Carn, whose sons Javier and Ezekiel stood in awe looking up at the horses. \n\nWhile her children took in the spectacle, Adam Young, who recently moved to the Residences at Rodney from Philadelphia, said the stabbing just around the corner is disconcerting. \n\nHe said the slaying was a random act that could have happened anywhere, but the fact that it happened around the corner is shocking. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect that to happen,\u201d said Young, who added he thinks the area is a little dangerous. \n\n\u201cEven during the daytime I wouldn\u2019t walk terribly far.\u201d \n\nAaron Stansell, a kitchen managers at Ernest and Scott Taproom, flagged down police after the alleged assailant, Calvin Hooker III, walked by the restaurant. \n\n\u201cI know Wilmington is dangerous,\u201d said Stansell, who was recently robbed at gunpoint near 8th and Orange streets while walking to his car after work one night. \n\n\u201cThey just walked up to me and put a gun to my head,\u201d Stansell said. The robbers got away with $40 and Stansell\u2019s cell phone. \n\n\u201cI think people pretty much know that it\u2019s dangerous and so they don\u2019t live here or come here,\u201d he said. \n\nStansell said he only continues to work here because it is good money. \n\nSheila Carn, who lives in Riverside, said the increased police presence is about safety. \n\n\u201cI think it is good because we need more cops,\u201d Carn said. While she has her own concerns about her neighborhood, Carn said it is also needed in Rodney Square where people congregate and loiter for hours. \n\n\u201cThis is a big population for drugs. People sleep here,\u201d Carn said, admitting she doesn\u2019t take the bus alone at night and tries to leave work before it gets too dark. \n\nIn addition to the stabbing on Monday, a man was shot in the chest on the 800 block of N. West Street in January inside an apartment. The area around Rodney Square typically sees crime like thefts from buildings and robberies, according to city crime data. \n\nFor Haley Peoples and Amy Riddell, who work in the Nemours Building, the presence of police and the mounted patrol are a relief. The women said while they have never been the victims of violence, they know co-workers who have, some having their cell phones stolen as they walked to their cars. \n\n\u201cJust seeing the mounted patrol and knowing that they are there makes you feel better,\u201d Riddell said. \u201cAnd I know is that someone is watching my back.\u201d \n\nPeoples said the violence has made her think twice about working in downtown Wilmington, but hasn\u2019t been enough of a problem to make her leave. \n\n\u201cI have a family to look out for,\u201d Peoples said. \n\nPaige Mikstas, who also works downtown, said she feels unsafe walking and crime is definitely one of the factors keeping her from moving into Wilmington. \n\n\u201cI have friends who live on Market Street and sometimes will stay after work,\u201d Mikstas said. \u201cI think if they don\u2019t live close by, people try to avoid the area after, like, 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.\u201d \n\nMikstas said she is uncomfortable walking around in the city after dark. \n\n\u201cYou just have to take the general precautions like don\u2019t walk around alone, walk fast,\u201d Mikstas said. \u201cMy dad always told me to look pissed off when walking alone and feeling uncomfortable, because then no one will bother you.\u201d \n\nDowntown Visions, a public-private organization aimed at improving the downtown, offers safety escorts for employees walking to their vehicles or to public transportation, to help ease any fears, said Marty Hageman, the organization\u2019s executive director. \n\nBetween July 2014 and June 2015, the \u201csafety ambassadors\u201d were called to 4,556 safety escorts, Hageman said. \n\n\u201cThe number of requests tends to decrease when it is warmer out and increase in the winter, when the sun sets earlier,\u201d he said. \n\nWSFS bank, which employs about 275 people in Wilmington, said they often share safety tips with employees, including encouraging them to use the safety escort services offered by Downtown Visions, said spokeswoman Cortney Klein. \n\nThe Delaware College of Art and Design does the same with students moving into dorms in the Wilmington Campus and provides information for the safety escort program to them. \n\n\u201cWe carry security guards in our buildings and in our residence halls and we have key cards and video monitoring,\u201d said Jason Mokar, director of student services at the school. Mokar said the school has never had any issue with violence or safety concerns, but takes precautions like on any college campus. \n\nThe call for an increased police presence was heard loud and clear from the business community earlier this year as some threatened to consider relocating from downtown. \n\nWilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said his department has worked to increase the presence in the central business district, and the help of New Castle County Police will boost the patrol numbers there. \n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams echoed Cummings, saying the city cannot afford to lose businesses, so there must be a sustained law enforcement effort downtown and there must be an effort to address the homeless who gather as well as those who suffer from drug addiction or mental illness. \n\nThat effort by police hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by businesses, said Richard Heffron, the head of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \n\n\u201cI know they are trying,\u201d said Heffron. \n\nMac Nagaswami, CEO of Carvertise, located in the Hercules Building at 1313 N. Market Street, said he and his employees haven\u2019t ever had a problem with crime and feel comfortable walking around downtown. \n\n\u201cThe reality is here in downtown there is such a large visual presence so everybody feels safe,\u201d Nagaswami said. \n\nBut for residents who live in the area, crime is a persistent and serious concern. \n\nBen Cohen, president of the Midtown Brandywine Neighbors Association, said his group has reached out to police asking for additional patrols and surveillance. \n\n\u201cI think we are pretty concerned about crime,\u201d Cohen said, adding that one of his neighbors was held at gunpoint a few weeks ago, but escaped unharmed. \u201cThere is a concern about public safety in the city at the moment.\u201d \n\nMike Hare, senior vice president for Buccini/Pollin, a development group that has several apartment buildings in downtown Wilmington, including on Rodney Square, said the company polls its residents about living downtown and safety has not been a top issue for most. \n\n\u201cPeople who choose to live downtown are used to more mess than most,\u201d Hare said, adding that any kind of violence is unacceptable and a concern for those who work and live in the area. \n\n\u201cI think some people are shaken by the incident this week,\u201d Hare said. \u201cAs long as these incidents don\u2019t continue and there is an appropriate police response it will be OK. We remain advocates as a company for improved public safety deployment in the city and have long been advocating for mounted patrols to come back, but our goal is to eliminate the concern.\u201d \n\nCohen, whose neighborhood is just a few blocks from Rodney Square said he is encouraged seeing more and more officers on the street. \n\n\u201cI believe they are doing the best they can,\u201d he said. \n\nBrian Lofink, who lives in the Midtown Brandywine neighborhood and works downtown, said right now things seem pretty safe, but if crime continues to increase and move toward his neighborhood, it could be a reason to think about moving out. \n\n\u201cI could see it becoming an issue at some point,\u201d he said. \n\nContact Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com or 324-2837. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1F7nA5N", "source": "Delaware Online"}
