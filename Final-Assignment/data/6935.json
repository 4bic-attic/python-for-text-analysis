Matuszak has been negotiating with the family for about a year. He wouldn\u2019t release any information about them except that they reside in Peoria County, making them eligible for a 30 percent discount on their purchase. The family is considering two sites for the mausoleum \u2014 one in the Riverview South section of the cemetery, and the other in plot of land across from Summit Range South. The news caused a flurry of discussion among authority members. Since it has been so long since a family purchased land and built a mausoleum in the cemetery, there were questions about protocol. Authority member Al Andrews thought board approval was needed for the Riverview South site, since it has not been officially plotted for burials. \u201cThat might be the old dump area, and might not be suitable for structural foundations,\u201d he said. Authority member Garth Madison raised concerns about the style of building the family was planning. \u201cThere needs to be design approval, some kind of oversight so we don\u2019t have someone building something wildly out of place,\u201d he said. Even an audience member had a concern. \u201cI hope you have a percent that is going to go in perpetuity to fund the cost of maintaining the property,\u201d said Cheryl Budzinski. Authority Chairman Bob Manning asked Matuszak to contact other historic cemeteries to see what kind of guidelines they have in place for new construction. Since Springdale is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, there might be more regulations that need to be followed, said Andrews. Matuszak reassured authority members. \u201cWhatever the family wants to do, I can make it contingent upon approval of the board,\u201d said Matuszak. \u201cBut I think they want to be here in a big way.\u201d Andrews said the deal was very much welcome. \u201cWe want them to build here,\u201d he said. Matuszak would not talk about either the size of the planned mausoleum or the amount of money being negotiated for the land, other than to say that both were \u201csignificant.\u201d It\u2019s not the only mausoleum deal Matuszak is negotiating. He\u2019s also in serious discussions with a St. Louis family with roots in Peoria, he said. There are 15 family mausoleums in Springdale Cemetery. The oldest was built in 1859 by the Zotz family, and the newest was built in 1935 by the Fromme family. The fact that people are considering investing in Springdale Cemetery again is a good sign, said Matuszak.
