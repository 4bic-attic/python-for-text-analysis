The results, as you might expect, are astronomical. Here are a few of our favorites. \n\nThe image above, by Chap Him Wong from Hong Kong, won the People & Space category. It depicts Sunset Peak, Hong Kong\u2019s third-highest mountain, with star trails looming behind. the trails of light are from campers wandering along the paths. \n\nMeanwhile, below is a shot of Comet/2014 E2 Jacques in the path of the spectacular NGC 896 Nebula by Lefteris Velissaratos from Greece.

The shot of Comet Lovejoy, captured by 15-year-old George Martin from the UK, reveals its motion against the stars because the stars appear to trail. Imagine being able to take photographs like that at the age of 15 \n\n! \n\nFinally, this picture of the 2015 solar eclipse as seen from Svalb\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
