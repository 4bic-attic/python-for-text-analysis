This time they are introducing us to the IK-KV-12.1 monitor, a high-bright, daylight readable flat panel display. \n\nThis 12.1-inch rugged monitor is the first in the all new iKeyVision display line from iKey. Aside from being daylight readable, the display also has a two-point capacitive touch screen, and integrated speakers. The touch screen has up to 1000 nits of brightness, meaning there is no glare or obstructions while working in bright areas. The iKeyVision also comes with an on-screen display control panel for easier component adjustment and includes a one-touch emergency key. \n\nIn addition, it features a standard VESA pattern for in-vehicle mounting. The VESA mount pattern makes it ideal for mobile, public safety, transportation, and utility applications. \n\nLike the rest of iKey's rugged line of products the iKeyVision can withstand the harshest elements in any environment, keeping people productive on and off the field. \n\n\"At iKey we are constantly working to develop new products.
