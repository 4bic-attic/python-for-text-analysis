Turtle stew is a local favorite.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11896\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] Just like men, women also lead in carrying products to the market[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11882\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Theystart displaying their products at the open market early in the morning[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11876\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] One section of the market displays sago, and other agricultural products. Fish and other aquatic products are displayed in another section of the market[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11895\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] Garden products do not sell too quickly and so the families have to stay on the island for days.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11880\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] While on the island, the boats become the family's temporary home[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11881\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] A mother does her laundry while her husband sells bananas at the market[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11886\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] Small kids stay inside the boat all day...[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11884\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] ...
