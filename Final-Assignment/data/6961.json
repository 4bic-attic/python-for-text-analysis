The results? LOVE this piece! \n \n\n \nYou can check out the whole how-to for this surprisingly easy background here is my YouTube video . \n \n\n \n\n BlueMoonScrapbooking \u00a0and\u00a0 Scrapbook.com \u00a0 carry most of the supplies I used, you can also use the affiliate links below to Simon Says Stamp. \n \nSupplies Used: \n \n                                                                                                       InLinkz.com  \nI love these cameos so much \u2013 this one inspired my canvas. \n \n\n \nFrom the rosette (I used the snowflake design!) to the alcohol ink colored roses I just love how this turned out! It was surprisingly quick and easy too \u2013 which is always a bonus! \n \n \nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial and project. I\u2019ll be doing more with stencils in the new class I\u2019m just starting to develop (don\u2019t hold your breath -it\u2019s gonna be a while!) and you can bet the turn the stencil + use it more than once to get a design like this will be used.", "source": "Craft With May"}
