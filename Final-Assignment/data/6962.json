I will be able to go the conference and present the paper, which I will upload to my academia.edu profile after I will be back.I am leaving to Madrid in two weeks and you can't imagine how grateful I am!!!On the one hand I am very happy for this success, but on the other hand I feel angry that our funding system is non-operative, so researchers must: a) skip a part of the academic events; b) look for alternative funding (as did I); c) to fund it by themselves (what is usually hardly possible since many of researchers are underpaid in Lithuania).", "source": "Indiegogo: Announcements"}
