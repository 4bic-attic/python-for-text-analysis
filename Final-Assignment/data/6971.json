Other charges include racketeering and money laundering. \n \n\u201cThis case is not just about me. This case is about how much control we allow US corporations and the US government to have over the Internet,\u201d Dotcom said on Twitter before the hearing  began. \n \nDotcom entered the courtroom wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, his Mercedes SUV with the number plate \u201cKIM.COM\u201d parked outside. \n \nDozens of black-clad police, working in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rappelled into Dotcom\u2019s New Zealand mansion in 2012. Years of legal wrangling ensued. \n \nU.S. authorities say Dotcom and the three other Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows. \n \nDotcom greeted supporters in the gallery but sat apart from the other accused men in a black leather arm chair brought to the court from his mansion. He told New Zealand radio last week he needed a special chair because of back problems. \n \nThe case is being watched closely by the media industry and developers in the file-sharing business for signs of how far Washington is willing to go to protect U.S. copyright holders. \n \nThe hearing is scheduled to take two weeks. Monday\u2019s session was largely procedural and the case will resume on Thursday. \n \n(Reporting by Nigel Marple in AUCKLAND; Additional reporting by Charlotte Greenfield in WELLINGTON; Editing by Paul Tait)", "source": "SRN News"}
