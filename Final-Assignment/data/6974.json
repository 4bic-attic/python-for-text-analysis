The Times says that the TCS employees shadowed the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us employees and created intricate manuals for how to perform the jobs of 67 different workers. They then returned to India and trained other TCS employees how to do those jobs. The Toys \u201cR\u201d Us employees were subsequently laid off. \n \nMost of these foreign workers are in the US on a visa program known as\u00a0 H-1B , which allows American employers to hire foreign professionals with \u201chighly specialized knowledge\u201d to meet their needs. According to federal guidelines, employers must sign a declaration that the foreign workers\u00a0 \u201cwill not adversely affect the working conditions\u201d of Americans or lower their wages,\u201d the Times reports.\u00a0 \n \nThe\u00a0American workers being laid off at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and New York Life say the foreign workers did not have highly specialized knowledge. In addition, the Americans were instructed to teach the foreign workers how to do their jobs. If they refused, they were asked to resign.\u00a0 \n \n    \nFlickr/werkmens \n    \n\n \n\u201cAt the very least, those are violations of the spirit of the law,\u201d Christine Brigagliano, a lawyer who advises companies on obtaining visas, told the Times. \u00a0\u201cThose contractors are signing on the bottom line, saying we will not undercut the wages and working conditions of Americans. But, in fact, they are.\u201d \n \nToys \u201cR\u201d Us and New York Life both defended their outsourcing practices to the Times by saying it will lead to future growth in the US. \n \nThe staff reduction was a part of \u201c designing a streamlined, more efficient global organization to make it fit for growth,\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh said, adding that the contractors were required to comply with\u00a0 \u201cany and all immigration laws\u201d and that the outsourcing\u00a0 \u201cresulted in significant cost savings.\u201d \n \n\u201cOur decisions are centered on keeping the company competitive, keeping it in the United States, keeping it growing,\u201d New York Life spokesman William Werfelman added. \u00a0 \n Check out the full report here\u00bb   NOW WATCH: RED EVERYWHERE: It\u2019s a global market meltdown      \n \n   \n   \nRead more stories on Business Insider , Malaysian edition of the world\u2019s fastest-growing business and technology news website.", "source": "Business Insider Malaysia"}
