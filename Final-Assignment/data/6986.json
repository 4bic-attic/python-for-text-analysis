Brazil is one of the partner countries identified by the fund for research collaborations on development topics. \n\nAs well as research collaborations, the mission could lead to a framework agreement between the Scottish Funding Council and state funding councils in Brazil, PhD studentships, including fee-waivers, for Brazilian students to study in Scotland and opportunities for Scottish PhD students to complete fieldwork in Brazil.\n\nLloyd Anderson, Director of British Council Scotland, a Connected Scotland partner said: \"Brazil has now grown to be one of the major education partners for Scotland. \n\n\"Education in Brazil is a complex and rewarding market that requires a collective approach from Scottish HEIs and this joint mission represents a great opportunity for Scottish and Brazilian researchers to exchange expertise and increase long-term research collaboration. \n\n\"The benefits of internationalising applied research cannot be undervalued as it not only contributes to greater economic balance but boosts career prospects for those involved.\n\n\"Building the global learning community lies at the very heart of British Council Scotland and therefore we are delighted to be part of this ambitious undertaking with Connected Scotland.\"", "source": "Brechin Advertiser"}
