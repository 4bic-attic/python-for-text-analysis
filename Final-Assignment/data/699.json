Hopefully she'll come along to a pub quiz, I might have a chance with her on my team.\u201d \n \nBut it\u2019s not the only thing in the pipeline for Ben, who will soon be in front of the camera for a worthy cause as well as on stage. \n \n\u201cI'll be shooting a short film for the Teenage Cancer Trust within the next couple of months. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\u201cIt's important to get a mix of stage and screen as actors can so often be pigeon holed, ultimately restricting the work you can get. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be working for such an amazing charity too.\u201d", "source": "Runcorn and Widnes World"}
