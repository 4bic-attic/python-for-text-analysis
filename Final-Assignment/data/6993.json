It is not only the responsibility of the factories, hospitals, pharmacies, pharmacovigilance officers and governments (but all of us).\u201d \n\n\u201cThe governments issue alerts on the different types of drugs based on patients\u2019 notifications,\u201d he continued, adding that whatever information governments get from the ground are disseminated to regional health regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) including the World Health Organisation on the international level. \n\nAl Amiri also said at some point at the press conference, \u201cWe, in government are doing everything that we can.\u201d \n\nAsked on how drug companies guarantee that medications and treatments are safe for use, BI-Middle East/Turkey/Africa medical director Prof Dr Mohammad Meshref said the industry is \u201chighly regulated.\u201d \n\nHence, all pharmaceutical products are subjected to stringent examinations and \u201cauditing\u201d by every government these are applying for registration and distribution or sale, after these have been approved by the FDA and EMEA. \n\n\u201cOur strategy is driven by a central focus on the safety and well-being of patients everywhere. Having said that, healthcare companies and representatives are all ethically-bound to identify and respond to drug safety issues that could compromise the health of individuals, groups and populations alike,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Gulf Today"}
