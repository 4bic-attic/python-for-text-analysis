Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands and South West were the three English regions that recorded an increase in exports, while all others saw export values fall. \n\nThe industries that recorded the largest reductions in earnings from exports were all involved in \"petroleum, petroleum products and related materials\", said HMRC. \n\nOil-related companies recorded a \u00a37.9bn \u2013 or 43pc - fall in export values, as the price of the commodity has plunged in the past year. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, recently hit six-year lows of below $45 a barrel. \n\n\u201cTurmoil and change in the Asian markets \u2013 specifically in China - has meant a loss of momentum from these markets,\u201d said Rob Donaldson, head of corporate finance at accountancy firm Baker Tilly. \n\n\u201cEuropean exports have struggled as a result of the still sluggish European economy being battered by the lack of confidence. Add to this the European-wide austerity, and we have a long way to go before we start to see any early signs of a pick-up in Europe,\" he added. \n\nHowever, the data suggest the number of exporting businesses rose by 2.1pc over the year to 50,300, as firms increasingly see the benefit of targeting overseas customers as a way of boosting sales. \n\nMore recent data from the Office for National Statistics, which takes most of its data from HMRC, also suggests that exports have picked up again in the past couple of months. \n\nEngland as a whole accounts for 75pc of all exports in the UK, with the South East contributing the greatest share in the UK at 14pc. The US remains the largest export partner by value for England, Wales and Scotland, followed by Germany, France, the Netherlands and China. \n\nThe total annual value of UK imports fell by 1pc to \u00a3405bn over the year.", "source": "Telegraph"}
