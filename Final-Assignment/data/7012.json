This was reported to Agenzia Fides by Bishop William Shomali, Patriarchal Vicar for Jerusalem and Palestine of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. \u201cThis episode\u201d, explains to Fides Bishop Shomali \u201churts the image of Bethlehem and its coexistence. The monastery of Mar Charbel had received aid for its restoration by the Palestinian National Fund, on the orders of President Abu Mazen. The project to repair the religious house, in ruins for years, had been supported by the Palestinian government. This is why now the Palestinian authorities want to find out the author or authors of this act of vandalism. And the first results of the investigation\u201d, adds the Patriarchal Vicar \u201cfollow the line of criminal retaliation for reasons of interest, and not that of intimidation with religious reasons. In short, a vindictive revenge in some way connected with the use of the funding arranged for the work of restoration\u201d. The fire destroyed much of the furniture on the second floor. \n\r \nOn Saturday the monastery was visited by the Mayor of Bethlehem, Professor Vera baboun, and by the leaders of the security forces and Palestinian intelligence, welcomed by Bishop Shomali and several priests from Bethlehem, Beit Sahour and Beit Jala. \n\r \nThe restoration of the monastery, founded in 1983 and belongs to the Maronite Church in the Holy Land, had started in January, after being closed for fifteen years also due to administrative reasons.
