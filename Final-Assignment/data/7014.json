In constant pain, I remain since July 27th. My wrist was broken when I fell off my bike. \u00a0My grip is getting stronger. \u00a0I still can not turn a doorknob, to open a door. \u00a0 Typing with both hands is now possible. \u00a0More range of movement with my hand and wrist helps me do things this week that I couldn't for a month: buttoning my pants and shirts, tying my shoes, \u00a0Fastening a belt, better at scrubbing the left side of my body. (I had to use my left hand.)\n3. \u00a0I am internally\nreferented, abiding by my feelings, wants and values. \u00a0I do not let others opinion of me define who I am or determine my moods. I do not placate others.\n4. \u00a0When relating with others, last week, I sought to know what is best for both us. I am not interested only in what is beneficial for me, \u00a0 Nor do I deny myself, only looking at what is best for the other person. \u00a0I want to do what is in the best interest for everyone. That is Tradition 2 in recovery, something I have learned through being a consistent, dedicated member of Al-Anon Family Groups.\n5. \u00a0Several opportunities to react in the past seven days. \u00a0I am thankful for principles that help me be emotionally mature. \u00a0It allows me to stay and be comfortable with negative feelings. \u00a0I do not rush to conclusions. \u00a0I state and see things as neutrally as possible, relying upon my senses only.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No interpretations of me by others are wanted. \u00a0I rather relate than having another trying to control me with their judgments. \u00a0I live in a judgment-free zone.\nHow About You?\nWhat were the best things that happened to you last week?\nI am exhausted. I'll re-work this tomorrow, Tuesday. \u00a0Good night.", "source": "The Attitude of Gratitude Inn"}
