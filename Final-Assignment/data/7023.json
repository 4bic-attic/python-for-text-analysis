Finnegan has been with the company\u00a0since\u00a02011. \n \n\u201cHe [Finnegan] is as clear a thinker as any I\u2019ve worked with,\u201d wrote Atlantic Media CEO and chairman\u00a0 David Bradley , in a memo. \u201cI\u2019ve come to trust his thinking and judgment coping with the (fear-inspiring) complexity of modern media. Against all odds, Atlantic Media grew 20 percent last year; against all odds, it will do the same this year as well. This is a team accomplishment, but it\u2019s hard to overstate Michael Finnegan\u2019s centrality to that team.\u201d \n \nFinnegan\u2019s appointment is effective immediately.", "source": "NetNewsCheck"}
