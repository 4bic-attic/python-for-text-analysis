Apple has not released any sales figures so far. \n \nAndroid and Android Wear, the operating system from Google, is expected to grab a 17.4 percent market share with 4.1 million units selling this year, according to IDC. \n \nSmart wristwear, including watches and bands that are capable of running third-party applications, is a key growth driver, according to IDC. \n \nThis includes the Apple Watch, Motorola\u2019s Moto 360, Samsung\u2019s Gear S-series, and Pebble\u2019s Time. \n \n\u201cWe are at a stage now where more vendors are getting into this segment, setting the stage for more selection and ultimately more volumes,\u201d said IDC\u2019s Ramon Llamas. \n \n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "Zululand Observer"}
