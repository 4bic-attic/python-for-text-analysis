CERN\u2019s Advanced Information Services (AIS) group is embedding Pentaho into several internal applications to optimize all of the operational groups responsible for running the world\u2019s largest particle physics laboratory. When the project is completed at year-end 2015, CERN\u2019s community of 15,000+ users will benefit from a single, 360-degree view of all native operational data along with analytics and self-service reports. \n\n \nDerek Mathieson and Jan Janke respectively Group and Deputy Group Leader GS-AIS, CERN will present this ground-breaking project for the first time during PentahoWorld 2015 , taking place on October 14-15 in Orlando, Florida. \n \nEmbedded into day-to-day operations across the organization \n \nIn June, CERN restarted the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its main particle accelerator, following a major upgrade. To ensure that administrative processes do not interrupt the ground-breaking research ongoing at the laboratory, systems must be fast, simple and seamlessly embedded into familiar processes and applications. Rather than creating and rolling out a new standalone analytics application, CERN is embedding Pentaho via its web APIs to give all of its users access to analytics and reports through the familiar departmental applications that they use every day. This integration will provide in-context insights to the organization\u2019s users and management across areas including finance, human resources, logistics, process automation and many other business functions.\u00a0 \n \nGoverned, role-based access for rigorous data protection \n \nAs an international non-governmental organization, CERN\u2019s corporate information systems face unique challenges. Not only does CERN employ around 2,500 staff, but acts also as a university, hosting hundreds of students, and thousands of visiting scientists every year. It also delivers services to its staff and their families typically found in their home nation such as pensions and health insurance and public services like housing, healthcare, and security. \n \nCERN\u2019s many functions mean that the data it holds on its personnel is subject to substantial data protection and compliance regulations. The individual\u2019s role in the CERN community \u2013 whether it be full-time scientist, short-term trainee, or security guard \u2013 subjects their data to unique security and access privileges. \n \nPentaho\u2019s capabilities for governed data delivery and its open, extensible platform are enabling CERN to define data and analytics access privileges for every distinct role in its community.\u00a0 Pentaho provides compatibility with access rights across CERN applications, while still providing the flexibility to accommodate evolving security rules. CERN\u2019s security implementation with Pentaho is complete and currently being tested internally. \n \nAccording to Jan Janke, \u201cCERN\u2019s systems need to manage high volumes of confidential data on its employees and their families so security, data governance and data integrity are all paramount. After reviewing five different proprietary and open source platforms, Pentaho emerged as best adapted to our needs. I believe it is a future-proof solution that will help us to ensure data governance, \u2018one version of the truth\u2019 and a great user experience.\u201d \n \nResources: \n \nABOUT PENTAHO, A HITACHI DATA SYSTEMS COMPANY \n \nPentaho, a Hitachi Data Systems company, is a leading data integration and business analytics company with an enterprise-class, open source-based platform for diverse big data deployments.
