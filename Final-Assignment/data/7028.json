Chris Christie has been stepping up his attacks against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Christie says Clinton may have committed a crime in her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business. \n \nYet the only email Christie has provided to a state legislative committee investigating the 2013 Fort Lee lane closures came from his own private Yahoo account. New Jersey Public Radio's Matt Katz talks with WNYC's Jaimi Floyd about what Clinton and Christie's email lapses have in common. \n  \nMatt Katz, New Jersey Public Radio/WNYC \n Political reporter Matt Katz is The Christie Tracker at WNYC.org .
