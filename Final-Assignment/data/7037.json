A public input hearing was held earlier this year at the Upper Merion Township Building where Valley Forge Casino Resort personnel submitted exhibits and presented testimony on various aspects of the facility's operation since its initial license was issued in November 2011.\u00a0 The public was also permitted to provide testimony on the casino and its impact in the community. \nIn reaching its decision, the Board also reviewed testimony received at the hearing from local government officials, community groups and the PA State Police, along with the Gaming Control Board's Office of Enforcement Counsel, Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement, Office of Compulsive and Problem Gaming, and Casino Compliance.\u00a0 Each testified as to Valley Forge Casino Resort's performance since it began operations in March 2012 . \nAdditionally, a public hearing was held in Harrisburg today to permit Board members to further question Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, LP representatives about any remaining issues prior to voting on the renewal. A PowerPoint presentation provided at today's meeting is available on the Board's web site, www.gamingcontrolboard.pa.gov , under the Board Meetings tab. \nSince its opening, Valley Forge Casino Resort has generated $342 million in gross revenue from the play of slot machines and table games resulting in a return to the Commonwealth of almost $140 million in gaming tax revenue.\u00a0 Valley Forge Casino Resort currently operates 600 slot machines and 50 table games, while employing 1,060 persons. \nThe next meeting of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. , Wednesday, October 21, 2015 in the PGCB's Public Hearing Room located on the second floor of Strawberry Square in Harrisburg.\u00a0 \n About the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board :The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board was established in 2004 and is tasked to oversee all aspects of the state's casino industry.
