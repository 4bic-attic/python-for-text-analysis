That's an enormous step from where it was. And it is moving ahead with a reform agenda of its own design. It fully warrants the continued assistance of the international community for the simple reason that Afghanistan's success is our shared goal,\" said Kerry. \n \nUnderlining the challenges faced by Afghanistan, Kerry said, \"The Afghan people are still threatened by Taliban, and other violent extremists have entered the fray. Governing and judicial institutions still need to be strengthened. The economy is barely scratching the surface of its potential. Corruption and abuses of human rights are matters of grave concern to everybody, and we know they have to be addressed.\" \n \nKerry, however, said these and other problems obviously can't be underestimated, but neither should we ignore the remarkable gains that are being made and which defines the promise and future of Afghanistan. \"The development trends in Afghanistan are positive, and it matters that a whole new generation of Afghans is eager for the chance to move their country forward,\" he added. \n \nHowever, reiterating China's support for the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, \"China has played an active part in Afghan-related international and regional cooperation and has actively participated in the CBMs under the Istanbul Process. We will actively advance trilateral cooperation involving China, the U.S., Afghanistan and China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and to help forge synergy among the various assistance efforts.\" \n \n\"On issues of peace and development, we are bound together in a community of shared future. The Afghan people aspire for stability and prosperity, but that goal is also shared by the broader international community,\" he said, while reiterating Chins's commitment to work with the international community for sustained peace, development, and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region.
