Alexa Cioffi, 21, of Staten Island, and a 22-year-old woman were both unconscious, and were taken to Staten Island University North Hospital, where Cioffi pronounced dead. \n\nThe other woman is in critical condition. A 2015 Toyota SUV was traveling north on Hylan Boulevard with a boat in tow when it tried to change lanes and its trailer detached. \n\nThe trailer continued rolling in the right lane, striking the 22-year-old bicyclist. The boat then hit Cioffi, who was pinned under the vehicle as it stopped. The driver of the Toyota remained on the scene. \n\n \nIt is not yet clear if the fishing boat was properly attached to the Toyota. \nPolice are investigating if the trailer hitch was somehow modified, and whether that cause it to become unsafe. \n\nThere are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing. \n \n(Copyright \u00a92015 WABC-TV.
