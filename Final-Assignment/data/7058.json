Tomlin also said that the problems always happen when the team plays at Gillette, but the Steelers announced Friday that they won\u2019t be lodging a formal complaint with the league. \u201cWe have provided information to NFL representatives regarding issues that occurred Thursday night at Gillette Stadium with our coach-to-coach headset communications system,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cThe problem was addressed during the game and we did not have further problems in the second half. We did not file a formal complaint, nor do we plan to do so.\u201d The NFL has said they will conduct a \u201cthorough review\u201d of the communication issues, which Bill Belichick said also affected the Patriots. Headset trouble has happened at other stadiums as well, including Heinz Field, and Panthers coach Ron Rivera said Friday, via Joe Person of the Charlotte Observer, he\u2019s had problems in stadiums other than Gillette over the years. If the problems are widespread, the NFL\u2019s \u201cthorough review\u201d of communication protocols should go well beyond New England since the league is providing the equipment to teams at every stadium.", "source": "ProFootballTalk"}
