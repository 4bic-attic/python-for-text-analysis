Morrow.\u00a0With the appearance of both Red Tornado & Dr. Morrow previously confirmed, for Supergirl\u2019s inaugural season, now comes word that the characters will both be brought to life by way of Iddo Goldberg (Salem, Tut). Red Tornado is described as the World\u2019s most advanced & powerful android, created by Dr. T. O. Morrow (get it?) for the U.S. military. Clearly something goes wrong, and the android becomes another problem, for National City, that Kara Danver\u2019s Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) persona has to deal with. Since, canonically, T.O. Morrow is villain, having created Red Tornado specifically to bring down the Justice League, it seems safe to assume that he will be the reason Red goes rogue. As to the nature of Iddo Goldberg\u2019s dual role: we\u2019ll have to wait and see how Red Tornado is adapted to the series. There are similarities to the Ultron-Vision dynamic, from Avengers canon; so it is possible that Goldberg could be lending his voice to a CGI/practical SFX creation. On the other hand, budget concerns \u2013 and the fact that Dr. Morrow has a tremendous ego \u2013 allow for Red Tornado being an identical copy of his creator (think STNG\u2019s Data & Dr. Soong). Dr. Morrow & Red Tornado add to a Supergirl first season already loaded with source villains, and a Kara-Red Tornado battle should be pretty big; but don\u2019t expect Red Tornado to be part of any Supergirl rogues gallery \u2013 the whole Ultron-Vision thing considered\u2026.
