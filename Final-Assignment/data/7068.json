And he said unto me, Write:\u00a0 for these words are true and faithful.\u00a0 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\u00a0 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\u00a0 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\u00a0 (Revelation 21:\u00a0 1-8, KJV)\n\n \n\nTHE DOUBLE DAGGER:\u00a0 The Apocryphal Books? (08/07/2015); Catholics, Protestants and The Trinity? (10/12/2014); The Gift of Life Despised? (10/13/2014); Succession (02/05/2014); On Youth Doing Enough (02/06/2014); Hierarchy (11/14/2013); The Benefit of Law? (11/15/2013); Confessing Only to GOD? (04/08/2013); Evidence of the Unseen Spirit? (04/09/2013)\n\n \n\n(1.)\u00a0 The proper business of Protestant believers is not to argue, condemn, debate, dismiss and question the benefits or weaknesses of doctrine and practice among Catholic believers.\u00a0 Completing the work of sharing the Gospel, preparing the body of believers for the Savior\u2019s Advent, and reconciling oneself to judgment through confession, repentance, and sanctification is more necessary.\u00a0 Those who repeatedly speak condemnation regarding such things as confession, genuflecting, or the mysteries of Rosary prayer usually do so having no part in those things, and speak from ignorance and common disbelief.\u00a0 Romans 14:\u00a0 4, King James Version (KJV):\u00a0 4 Who art thou that judgest another man\u2019s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up:\u00a0 for God is able to make him stand.\n\n(2.)\u00a0 Many argue that Catholic (we say, universal) belief is unacceptable, because it goes beyond the Hebrew canon, the Gospels and new testament holy writings, and embraces such non-biblical texts as the Apochrypha and the writings of Saint Augustine.\u00a0 In addition to Apostolic succession and traditions from the early church (established by those who were directly prepared and appointed through Jesus and the twelve), Catholics also acknowledge writings by others regarded as appointed and endowed through the Holy Spirit (we say, Church Fathers), including historians and scholars that, in the early centuries following the resurrection of Jesus, established the authenticity of early documents and teachings.\u00a0 John 10:\u00a0 15-17, KJV:\u00a0 15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father:\u00a0 and I lay down my life for the sheep.\u00a0 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold:\u00a0 them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\u00a0 17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.\n\n(3.)\u00a0 In addition to formal instruction (catechism) provided to all members, Catholics may depend upon formal writings developed by the Bishops, the Popes, and other men of faith (we say, churchmen).\u00a0 Given that the household of faith\u00a0 founded through the blood of Jesus may be spoken of as the Bride of Christ, for many Catholics the authority of the Church is understood to be similar to, where not equal to,\u00a0 that of the Husbandman.\u00a0 The church is not to be a clone, a copy, a counterfeit, or a replacement for Jesus.\u00a0 However, his wife is to be respected as a peer in 50-50 relationship, not as a concubine or slave.\u00a0 Therefore, the business of \u201crunning the household\u201d permits fixing Sunday as a day of rest and worship as well as calling forth aspects of new dispensation for those already ceased.\u00a0 Isaiah 54:\u00a0 5-8, KJV:\u00a0 5 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.\u00a0 6 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.\u00a0 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.\u00a0 8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.\n\n(4.)\u00a0 Where the church is seen operating upon a different platform of truth that seems to deny the things of the early believers this is often because the body of Christ must continue to respond as a ministry of reconciliation practiced by Jesus, and must answer to current aspects of human development, lapses or progress in ways that are not conservative, and that must display the peculiar risk-taking required by believers having to continue upon the earth.\u00a0 John 14:\u00a0 11-13, KJV:\u00a0 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me:\u00a0 or else believe me for the very works\u2019 sake.\u00a0 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\u00a0 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.) \n\n(5.)\u00a0 Where the church has been received as a body composed of the quick and the dead, it is neither impossible nor unreasonable that holy convocation would include the appearing of all believers from every age.\u00a0 Clearly, the action and input from those in flesh will be different from those whose spirit aspect is separated from their carnal form through death; and many secret things known only to divinity will be in effect and present.\u00a0 Romans 8:\u00a0 5-14, KJV:\u00a0 5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.\u00a0 6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\u00a0 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God:\u00a0 for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\u00a0 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.\u00a0 9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.\u00a0 10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.\u00a0 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.\u00a0 12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.\u00a0 13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die:\u00a0 but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\u00a0 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\n\nThere is far more to be considered, and carefully understood.\u00a0 For example, (6.)\u00a0 As among Catholics, Protestants acknowledge a principle that the church may receive the appointment of sacred officers and workers by the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 Thus, just as Matthias was elected to serve as an apostle in place of Judas, such men as Martin Luther, Calvin, Newton and Zwingli are also being received as sent by GOD and his Christ.\u00a0 Acts 1:\u00a0 23-26, KJV:\u00a0 23 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.\u00a0 24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,\u00a0 25 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.\u00a0 26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.)\u00a0 Even so, I trust this fragment will be useful.\u00a0 Be it unto you according to your faith.\n\n \nTHE BLACK PHOENIX\nWashington, DC", "source": "THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD"}
