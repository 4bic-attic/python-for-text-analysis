It was specified for its durability and low maintenance qualities as well as its ability to retain an attractive appearance when weathered. \n \nAward winning London architectural practice, Mador Architects were commissioned to design these luxury properties which have been sold to individuals for second homes and investment opportunities. \n \nIt was important that the Timber length was over 3.3m as they wanted to avoid butt joints which would spoil the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s natural look and feel.\u00a0 This was a hurdle that James Latham was able to advise on as Western Red Cedar produces long lightweight lengths of timber with a fine straight grain making this specie easy to cut, saw, machine and fix. \n \nIt was also essential that the wood used for the cladding was durable and would require little maintenance, while providing a quality and natural looking finish.\u00a0 With natural resistance to moisture, decay and insect damage, Western Red Cedar also offers outstanding dimensional stability, is lightweight and easy to work with and is simple to finish and stain which all go to make it the perfect material for exterior cladding applications.", "source": "Building Construction Design"}
