The letters\u2014sent over a 10 year period\u2014were published in the February 2015 issue of The Sun Magazine, and are entitled Your Wretched Correspondent. Wood is serving a twenty-two-year sentence in California for second-degree robbery. He allegedly\u00a0robbed banks and other venues with a toy gun to support his drug habit. In the shower the other morning, I was considering what it would be like to live in prison (where you are not even guaranteed a shower after a seven\u00a0hour stint of dishwashing in a gnarly prison kitchen) as I was staring out the window to a springtime blue sky and green trees from a bright, clean bathroom. My soul seems somehow to understand the feeling of being trapped. I shuddered to think of the prison walls, the shared showers and the overall wretched environment. I imagined how an inmate might feel standing in a private shower across from an open window, a soft breeze and sunlight streaming through,\u00a0and the ecstasy of other simple events like waking up each morning in a bed of one\u2019s own (something that my non-morning-person self does not currently delight in), placing your bare feet on a clean floor, choosing your breakfast, and on and on and on (I can only imagine). Wood writes, \u201cOne of the most jarring parts of being in prison is waking up. Every morning it comes crashing down: the smells, the walls, the noise, the irrefutable fact of being trapped, and the memory of the events that led me here\u201d (p. 38). He doesn\u2019t seem to feel sorry for himself though (well, maybe sometimes he does, I mean, who wouldn\u2019t?); instead, he accepts full responsibility for his current predicament and I think this sense of unexpected grace coupled with a raw sense of humor and willingness to look at himself are among the qualities of his writing voice that I am drawn to. \u201cThe first ten years behind bars didn\u2019t change me as much as they might have a normal person. Even though my life is in ruins, a complete catastrophe, a profound debacle (get out your thesaurus, look up \u2018fucked up,\u2019 and add to this sentence), right from the start I figured I could use the time to write and maybe regain my foolish soul.\u201d (p.45). Reading this, I am reminded of the beauty and blessings in my life. I have to say, though, that\u00a0I am not a big fan of the word \u201cblessings\u201d because of the way it is sometimes used, as in \u201cI am so blessed!\u201d to have such and such (insert: brand new jeep for my 25th birthday\u2026one of the more obnoxious \u201cso blessed\u201d offenses I have come across), as if those of us who don\u2019t have such things are not blessed? Cursed? I refer to blessings here in a more \u201ceveryday\u201d sense (\u201cordinary blessings,\u201d in Joan Didion\u2019s words): Blue sky. Green trees. Song birds outside my window. I digress. That morning in the shower, before I glanced through the bathroom window and noticed the beauty around me, I had been fretting over things that now seem like luxuries. How much of our lives are wasted by stressing over things that might be considered a luxury, a blessing, to someone else, or worrying about things that are out of our control (I am a big culprit of this one) while we ignore the beauty that is all around and within us? I know it\u2019s not all roses, but I also know that we can create our own private prisons even in the most physically appealing environments and, by the same token, inmates (or those who are physically trapped) can create freedom, space, for themselves by transcending the \u201clittle\u201d mind\u2014the part of the mind that keeps constant tabs on what is wrong, that keeps us feeling separate and disconnected from the source. Saint James Harris Wood inspires me by\u00a0creating art, beauty, inside prison walls. If he can do that, I\u00a0think we (i.e., those of us who are not in prison) can find our way too. Namaste, Saint James. \u00a0 * Note: These letters were originally published\u00a0in the February 2015 edition of The Sun Magazine, Issue 470.
