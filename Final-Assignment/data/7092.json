Rookie catcher Carson Blair homered for his first major league hit an inning later.\n\nAdrian Beltre homered twice to drive in five runs and Shin-Soo Choo also went deep for the Rangers, who stayed within 1 1-2 games of AL West-leading Houston. The Astros open a four-game series Monday in Texas.\n\nThose three homers came off Felix Doubront (3-2) in his seventh appearance for Oakland since being acquired from Toronto.\n\nThe left-hander struck out five, but allowed seven runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings. He was gone a batter after Beltre's second homer, when Prince Fielder reached on an infield single.\n\n\"Actually, it might have been the best command we've seen since he's been here. He just got a couple of balls in the wrong spot to Beltre,\" Melvin said.\n\n\"I've been throwing the ball well and getting back with my old stuff,\" Doubront said. \"Today I was throwing the ball really good until those innings. That happens.\"\n\nRookie right-hander Chi Chi Gonzalez (3-5) went 5 1-3 innings for his first victory in the majors since a three-hit shutout at Kansas City on June 5. The Rangers used five relievers after that.\n\nChoo put Texas ahead with his 18th homer, a solo drive onto the hill beyond center in the first. He was on base for both of Beltre's homers, a two-run shot in the fourth and a three-run blast in the fifth that made it 6-0.\n\nRougned Odor added a three-run homer in the eighth as Texas stayed one game ahead of Minnesota for the AL's second wild card \u2014 and can now look forward to the Astros.\n\n\"We talk about not looking ahead, not getting ahead of ourselves and staying focused on today. We have done a tremendous job at that,\" Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. \"But they're well aware of the next four days.\"\n\nGOING DEEP\n\nIt was Beltre's 27th career multihomer game, his first since June 4, 2014. ... The four homers matched a season high for the Rangers, who hadn't had a four-homer game at home since April 21, 2013.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nAthletics: Reliever Edward Mujica strained his right hamstring covering first base on a play in the fifth. ... C Stephen Vogt (groin), out for a week, played catch on the field before the game.\n\nRangers: Robinson Chirinos is still bothered by soreness in his strained left shoulder. The catcher will see a doctor again when the inflammation subsides.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: Sonny Gray goes for his 14th win when Oakland opens a four-game series at the Chicago White Sox.\n\nRangers: Cole Hamels (9-8) was given an extra day of rest, which set the right-hander up to pitch the series opener against Houston. He is 3-0 with a 3.34 ERA in his last five starts.", "source": "Beaufort Gazette"}
