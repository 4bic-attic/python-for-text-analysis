Authorities are reporting that more cash than ever is being lost to malicious software that\u2019s implanted on ATM machines throughout the world. Now, though, hackers have grown so sophisticated that they\u2019ve figured out how to drain an ATM of all its\u00a0money and walk away before anyone notices an attack took place. \n \nThe security firm Proofpoint unveiled new research Thursday announcing the discovery of GreenDispenser, a strain of malware that enables a hacker to trick a machine into spitting out cash simply by entering a special PIN number. An attacker likely needs to physically install the software on an ATM, Proofpoint reported, then control the machine\u2019s internal workings via an app specially designed for this purpose. It targets XFS standard, a Windows-based client server architecture that\u2019s been widely adopted on ATMs throughout the world. \n \n\u201cATM malware such as GreenDispenser is particularly alarming because it allows cybercriminals to attack financial institutions directly, without the extra steps required to capture credit and debit card information from consumers \u2013 and with correspondingly less traceability,\u201d Kevin Epstein, vice president of Threat Operations for Proofpoint, said in a statement. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many ATMs have been infected with GreenDispenser. \n \nResearchers said GreenDispenser, which briefly displays an \u201cOut of Service\u201d message and then self-destructs, wiping away much of the evidence, has been detected primarily in Mexico. But ATM skimming technology doesn\u2019t adhere to international borders, and a wave of recent cybersecurity research indicates that new forms of attacks have recently presented themselves in Mexico, Russia and throughout Europe. \n \nTake SUCEFUL, for example. \n \nResearchers at FireEye disclosed on September 11 that the malware subverted cash machines, forcing them to retain debit cards instead of returning them to the customer. While a customer walks away to ask for help, SUCEFUL-infused ATMs compile debit card data, read data from the chip of the card, suppress ATM sensors to avoid detection and eject only when a special PIN number is inputted, according to FireEye. The process makes it possible for hackers to steal physical cards, not just the information they contain. \n \nBoth GreenDispenser and SUCEFUL are thought to still be in development phase. \n \nLast year Symantec discovered that hackers were using text messages to trick ATMs into dispensing cash, and Kaspersky announced it was working with INTERPOL to identify the suspects behind another scam in Europe. \n \nThe European ATM Security Team revealed in April that the number of reported skimming incidents fell 3 percent in 2014 (5,631 from 5,822 in 2013), though total dollar loss jumped from $255 million to $300 million.", "source": "International Business Times"}
