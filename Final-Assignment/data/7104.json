Some researchers, including potentially Nikola Tesla, seem to think so!\nAether Flow -- The True Electric Current?\nby Hank Mills Pure Energy Systems News\nhttp://pesn.com/2012/01/27/9602024_Aether_Flow--The_True_Electric_Current/\nunquote\nElectricity it often spoken about in terms of electric 'current', and electrical 'flow', and even electrical 'pressures', and it's because, early on, scientists, not knowing what electricity is, thought of it as in comparison to water, which was easy to experiment with, and the self same mathematical formula that explained how water worked, they found that these worked for electricity too!\nquote\nFranklin's discoveries resulted from his investigations of electricity. Franklin proposed that \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" electricity were not different types of \"electrical fluid\" (as electricity was called then), but the same electrical fluid under different pressures. He was the first to label them as positive and negative respectively,[50] and he was the first to discover the principle of conservation of charge.[51]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin#Electricity\nunquote\ngo here in the above quote: electrical fluid\nBen Franklyn is pretty cool...remarkable that a fellow\u00a0could dabble in so many pursuits, and be exceptional...he made a remark about rattle snake bites that I went over in a Tree in the Door post...and it comes to mind again...and I was about to refer to it, but on reading, I find this:\nquote\nIn a 1772 letter to Joseph Priestley, Franklin lays out the earliest known description of the Pro & Con list,[65] a common decision-making technique, now sometimes called a decisional balance sheet:\n...\u00a0my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons con equal to some three Reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.[65] from above wiki\nunquote\nWhen I was aiming at the pool ball, I was thinking how in a real game, I assess my probability of making a shot...I look for ones I can take and make, and avoid those I would miss...a rehearsal of future probabilities\u00a0we do all the time!...anyway, lemmesee if I can find the rattlesnake thing...\nquote\nAs if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be a most defenseless animal; and even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible; but their wounds however small, are decisive and fatal. Conscious of this, she never wounds 'till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.\nBenjamin Franklin on the Rattlesnake as a Symbol of America\nhttp://www.greatseal.com/symbols/rattlesnake.html\nend quote\nSince the advent of the book Moneyball, the talkabouts on the radio sports channels can't get enough of talking about 'analytics'!\nFranklin can be subject infatuation myopic...meaning his description is made to suit his notion...I don't think rattlesnakes give much warning to mice!\nDavidDavid", "source": "Tree in the Door's Fauna and Flora"}
