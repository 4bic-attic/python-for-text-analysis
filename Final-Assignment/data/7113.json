Two minutes later, Ruslan Mukhametshin finished off a counter-attack to make it 3-0. \n\nLeonid Slutskiy's team pulled one back six minutes after halftime through substitute Kirill Panchenko and the hosts were also reduced to 10 men when Yannick Djalo was sent off for a second bookable offence four minutes later. \n\nThe tide turned as Zoran Tosic and Seydou Doumbia scored twice in a minute to pull CSKA level just before the hour, only for Lutsenko to put the hosts back in front with just over 20 minutes left. \n\nNigeria forward Ahmed Musa equalised in the 80th minute, then put the visitors 5-4 in front before Ivory Coast forward Doumbia, who re-joined CSKA on loan from Roma this season, scored his second with two minutes to play. \n\nCSKA stayed top of the Russian Premier League table with 25 points from nine matches, five ahead of Lokomotiv Moscow who beat Kriylia Sovetov 2-0. \n\nDefending champions Zenit St Petersburg are a further three points behind in third after being held 1-1 at home by midtable Amkar.
