Gibson's first film as a director since Apocalypto has several Australian cast members alongside the lead, English actor Andrew Garfield (Never Let Me Go, The Amazing Spider-Man). In the movie, based on a true story, Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a heroic conscientious objector who served as a medical orderly in the US Army and took his place in the frontline without carrying a weapon. Alongside Sam Worthington, Richard Roxburgh and Rachel Griffiths, Australian cast members also include Luke Bracey (who was in the Nicholas Sparks' adaptation The Best of Me, and is in the upcoming remake of Point Break) and Teresa Palmer (Warm Bodies, Knight of Cups). Gibson's 25-year-old son, Milo, is also in the film, in his first screen role.
