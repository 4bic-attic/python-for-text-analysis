It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t believe in it; I mean, really, who doesn\u2019t believe in having good health and fitness levels, right? It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been leading such a sedentary lifestyle before that it feels almost hypocritical to talk the talk but not walk the walk. \n \nAbout 7 weeks ago, that changed. I started exercising daily. I started to eat better. I started to drink more water. And I thought I\u2019d share my journey with you to better health and fitness and why I embarked on it. By the way, this blog post is going to be very long and rambly so get yourself a cup of tea and I\u2019ll meet you back here in 5. \n \n\n How this whole \u201cjourney\u201d started  \nRewind to a couple of months ago, I was rushing to catch a bus from the train station. The bus was probably about 50-100 metres away and as I didn\u2019t want to wait another 15 minutes for another bus to come, I decided to make a run for it. By the time I got up the bus, I was so out of breath, I almost blacked out. And then I started hyperventilating. \n \nI really thought for a second there and then that I was going to die. \n \nI used to be a 100m sprinter back in high school. How did it go from being a sprinter to not being able to even run for less than that distance without feeling like I wanted to die? By the time I got home, I was so ashamed at how terribly sedentary my lifestyle has become over the years that I knew I had to do something about it. I\u2019m 35 years old. I\u2019m no spring chicken but I\u2019m not very old either. Like the cliched saying on TV, it\u2019s time I got my life back. \n \nYou want to know how sedentary my lifestyle was before? A couple of years ago, I got myself a FitBit One. I thought maybe it would get me to walk more since I have it clipped on my bra all day and it could monitor my steps. My average daily number of steps was about 2000-3000. On a good day, it could be 5000. On a very, very good day, I may even hit 10,000. I was basically walking from my bedroom to the office, to the kitchen, to the living room, to the bathroom and back to the office. If I didn\u2019t have to walk Janey daily, I would be walking even less. Even so, I was only walking her for less than 10 minutes each time. \n \nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t exercise. I didn\u2019t like exercising. I hated to sweat. I thought I\u2019d start swimming more this year. I began with good intentions and then stopped in less than a month. \n \n\n I\u2019m ready to try anything. And that includes running.  \nBy now you\u2019ll know that I have some issues with infertility. Now I really don\u2019t know if my terribly low fitness levels have anything to do with it (I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t, but when you\u2019ve been trying for so long and nothing is happening, it\u2019s hard not to want to blame SOMETHING). When I knew I had to do something about my health and fitness levels, I thought that perhaps it could maybe even help things along in that department, y\u2019know what I mean? I could be wrong but hey, there\u2019s nothing wrong in hoping it would. \n \nI don\u2019t go to the gym but I knew I had to start somewhere so soon after that bus incident, I donned my pair of runners (which I literally purchased just to look good in. It was never intended for exercising) and I went for a brisk walk and very, very short run around my neighbourhood. I couldn\u2019t even run half a block without feeling out of breath and getting a stitch on my side. But when I got home, it felt good. Something about running cleared my mind and it helped me focus better. \n \nThe next day, I went walking and running again. It was only a 10-15 minute walk and run and I mostly walked because I couldn\u2019t run past 5 houses without getting out of breath. I rested for a day and did it again the next. A couple of weeks later, I downloaded the Couch 2 5K app on my phone and started a proper running program. I\u2019ve heard about Couch 2 5K for a few years now and even though I had downloaded the app to an old phone then, I never even started Day 1. \n \n\n The Couch 2 5K running program  \nIf you don\u2019t know what Couch 2 5K is, it\u2019s a running program for beginners who have never run before, who have probably led an equally sedentary lifestyle that I had and need that kick up the backside to just start walking. It\u2019s a 12-week program that will get you running (not just walking) 5km by the end of it. \n \nI\u2019ve just started Week 5. It\u2019s getting tougher but it feels good when the run is over. Seriously good. I don\u2019t run daily of course; it\u2019s not recommended and I don\u2019t want any extra stress to my knees and feet anyway. In between my running days, I\u2019ll either take a rest day or work out at home to aerobics and yoga. There are heaps of free workout and yoga videos on YouTube for it. I\u2019m also taking Janey for longer walks now. Instead of our usual 10-minute walk, we walk for at least 30-40 minutes. \n \nI was very worried that this would be a \u201cnew broom sweeps clean\u201d sort of thing, so I decided to log my exercises, daily water intake and daily steps taken into what I call my health and fitness journal (it\u2019s just a notebook with a calendar). There\u2019s something about putting it on paper that shows me how far I\u2019ve come. Sure, everything could be logged on apps but it somehow motivates me better when I write it down and see my progress. \n Thank goodness for my accountability buddy  \nHaving an accountability buddy was very important for me too because I don\u2019t want to fall off the wagon halfway. LeGeeque\u2019s running as well and she\u2019s my accountability buddy. We tell each other of our progress and cheer each other on. We\u2019re not competing against each other since our fitness levels are different to each other but having someone hold me accountable to my journey to better health and fitness helps tremendously. I\u2019m also very thankful to Norlin who got me started and hooked on running as well. \n \nSo, what are the results of my 7-week journey so far? My resting heart rate has gone down. I\u2019m still slightly breathless after climbing a long flight of stairs, but I don\u2019t have to stop in the middle of it to rest anymore. I no longer find > 1km distances so damn far. I\u2019ve lost a bit of weight. I\u2019m slowly strengthening my core. I can run 8 minutes non-stop. I\u2019m eating healthier and I\u2019m watching my portions (I don\u2019t cut anything out of my diet by the way. Hello, I still love food!) And best of all (you know I have to say this, being a beauty blogger and all ), my skin is looking much better. \n \n\n \nApologies for the amount of self-indulgent selfies. I take one after each run. \n My first run!  \nTo make this whole journey even better, I\u2019ve signed up for the City 2 Sea 5km run in November. Mind you, I\u2019m nowhere close to running a full 5km yet (I have quite a long way to go) but I\u2019m making that 5km run my target. Never in my life have I ever willingly signed up for anything like this but I figured I wanted to work towards a target and this is it. And you know what? I\u2019m really excited for it. Something which I couldn\u2019t even fathom a few months ago. LeGeeque will be joining me on this run as well and since my folks will be visiting us then, they\u2019ll be able to cheer us on. \n \nCall it tooting my own horn if you will, but I have to say that I\u2019m pretty damn proud of myself for doing this. For getting off my lazy backside and doing something about my very-low fitness level. Even Tim is impressed. He knows that this is incredibly hard for me and being a runner himself, I can\u2019t imagine it being easy for him to keep quiet about seeing me rot on the couch every evening and not even want to walk just that extra mile. I\u2019m the sort of person who would make him park the car as close to the entrance of a shopping centre/restaurant/etc as possible because I couldn\u2019t be arsed to walk. Kid you not. \n \nEven though it\u2019s only been 7 weeks and not 7 months, it\u2019s important for me to share this and also written down for you to see. If I had kept it a secret, who knows how quickly I would have fallen off the wagon. Plus if you have any tips for this beginner runner, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it! \n \n\n \nWhen I purchased my first activewear (off topic: activewear shopping is so damn fun and addictive!) at Target, I kept one of the labels that came with the running tights. It says \u201c 30 minutes a day. That\u2019s all. If you can find the time, your health and wellbeing will thank you. \u201d I have that label stuck to my planner so that it reminds me every day to move actively for at least 30 minutes. \n \nAnd what a change it has brought me. \n What about you? Do you have a health and fitness story to share? There\u2019s zero judgment here even if you don\u2019t like exercising. I\u2019ve been resisting it for so long that I didn\u2019t even think I could get rid of that ass print on my couch!   \n For (almost) daily blog updates via email, please click HERE . \n \nAlternatively, be an awesome BA Insider by hitting the subscribe button below for weekly news, tips and tricks and all that fun stuff in your email inbox. \n \n  \nCopyright \u00a9 Beautyholics Anonymous", "source": "Beautyholics Anonymous"}
