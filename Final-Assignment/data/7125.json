After several months on an upward track, mixed paper and board, supermarket corrigated paper board and old corrugated containers (OCC) have become cheaper again.\r \n \nPrice pressure had mounted in August, fuelled in part by a slump in the export business with Asian customers. This turn of events led to an knock-on effect on prices on the domestic market in September.\r \n \nPlayers on the markets in France and Italy explained that supplies were good and recovered paper was readily available in September. Consequently, paper producers had sufficient RCP stocks and their inventory levels were normal to high.\r \n \nThis article is an excerpt from EUWID's monthly report on the paper markets in France and Italy. The EUWID Price Watch France and EUWID Price Watch Italy for September will be published in EUWID Pulp and Paper no. 40 on 30 September. \n\nOur weekly newsletter's print and e-paper versions keep busy professionals up-to-date on the latest news from European pulp and paper markets. \n\nTest EUWID Pulp and Paper free of charge and without any obligation by clicking  here . \n Tags of this news", "source": "EUWID"}
