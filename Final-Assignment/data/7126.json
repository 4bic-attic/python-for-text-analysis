The boy was far away, ill, and despondent. He wrote his father fearfully asking whether there was any hope of a reconciliation. The father sent him a telegram of just one word, \u2018Home,\u2019 and it was signed \u2018Father.\u2019 The gospel of Jesus Christ is God\u2019s telegram to a sinful world. It is summed up in one word, \u2018Home,\u2019 and is signed by one word, \u2018Father\u2019even our Father in heaven. \n\nGod alone knows the path of life. Men have traced many paths, and millions have plodded their sad miles for thousands of years, finding at the end that all their \u2018yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.\u2019 He who is the living God, and He alone, knows and shows the path of life. \u2018In him was life; and the life was the light of men\u2019 (John 1:4). \u2018As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself\u2019 (John 5:26). The path of life is revealed in the words of Christ, \u2018The words that I speak unto you, . . . they are life\u2019 (John 6:63). \n\nAre you acquainted with \u2018fulness of joy\u2019? God\u2019s path of life leads to joy here and now\u2019joy in His service, joy even in suffering and disappointment. \u2018Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations [or trials]\u2019 (James 1:2; see 1 Peter 1:6-8). \u2018For the kingdom of God is . . . joy in the Holy Ghost\u2019 (Romans 14:17). This joy of believers cannot be explained; it is a \u2018joy unspeakable and full of glory\u2019 (1 Peter 1:8). And the path of life leads on to the very right hand of God above, where we enter into the joy of the Lord (Matthew 25:21) and find in His presence \u2018pleasures for evermore.\u2019 \n\nIn His word, God has clearly shown us the path of life. Let us follow it today, for \u2018the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\u2019 (Proverbs 4:18). \n\nMEDITATION PRAYER: \u2018My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation\u2019 (Psalms 13:5). \n\n\n___________________", "source": "Sebring Seventh Day Adventist Church \u00bb Sebring Seventh Day Adventist Church"}
