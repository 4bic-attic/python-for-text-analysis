Some think the Fed needs to make a decision sooner rather than later, while others think it should delay,\u201d Turkish deputy prime minister Cevdet Yilmaz told a news conference. \n \nTo limit the volatility of capital flows from emerging economies into dollars, the reason for concern about a future Federal Reserve hike, G20 financial leaders said they would avoid any surprise or excessive moves. \n \n\u201cWe will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our actions, especially against the backdrop of major monetary and other policy decisions, to minimise negative spillovers, mitigate uncertainty and promote transparency,\u201d they said. \n \nConcern about the turbulence that might be caused by a possible Fed rate hike was amplified by investor worries over an economic slowdown in China. \n \nG20 officials said they discussed the devaluation by China of its yuan currency in August, a move some may see as a realignment to market rates rather than a move to help exports. \n \nG20 officials welcomed strengthening activity in some economies but said that growth fell short of expectations because reforms were not being implemented quickly enough. \n \nLast year, G20 leaders agreed to boost global output over the next five years by 2% above what was already expected at the time through co-ordinated reforms and investment. \n \nBut they were behind schedule, the G20 communique indicated. \n \n\u201cWe are making progress towards our commitments [but]... more effort is needed for implementation,\u201d the statement said. \n \nLagarde was even more explicit, making clear governments had for too long relied on the supply of cheap cash from central banks that have been running ultra-loose monetary policy. \n \n\u201cMonetary policy alone will not cut it. It is necessary. It is recommended from our perspective, particularly in Europe and in Japan still, but it will not cut it on its own,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cClearly in the fiscal sphere as well as in the structural reforms sphere, more needs to be done, and it needs to accompany and eventually take the baton from the central bank governors.\u201d \n \nBoosting investment was key, the G20 financial leaders agreed. \n \nGovernments will prepare their final investment strategies by November, when G20 leaders are to meet to discuss them in Antalya in Turkey. \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
