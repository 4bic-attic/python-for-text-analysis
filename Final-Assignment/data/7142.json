This one\u2019s already eclipsed its $30k funding goal and managed to achieve a couple stretch goals, so whether you decide to back the game or not, you can look forward to its PC/Mac later this year via Steam. \n \n\n \nNext we have Cold Horizon from Big Cake Games. This hand-drawn, post-apocalyptic beauty is a 2D action/adventure platformer with elements of puzzle-solving, stealth, and survival. The game stars a polar bear named Eira, who assumes guardianship over a young boy and must lead him to safety while avoiding a clan of hunters and braving the harsh weather. \n \nCold Horizon hasn\u2019t picked up a lot of traction just yet\u2013at the time of this posting it\u2019s only managed to pull in a shade over $3,000 of a $40k funding goal\u2013but the campaign still has 26 days on the clock. It\u2019s also worth noting that the game is planned for an episodic release across five chapters. The minimum goal will only fund the first two episodes, while the developers actually needs up to $85k in stretch goals to ensure all five episodes make the projected 2016 launch for PC. Additional stretch goals are in place to fund development for Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo, Android, and iOS. \n \n\n \nLast but not least is Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan , a 2D side-scrolling action-RPG by pioneer African development studio Kiro\u2019o Games based out of Yaounde, Cameroon. The main draw to Aurion is its unique story and visuals inspired by African culture, lore, and mythology. Another standout feature is the game\u2019s action-packed, combo-heavy combat system, said to be at least partly inspired by Bandai Namco\u2019s \u2018Tales of\u2019 series. Aurion, already over $10k toward a funding target of $45k with a month to go, is projected to launch in Q2 2016 for Windows 7 & 8 PC via Steam, with stretch goals in place for potential release on Linux, Mac, and even home consoles.", "source": "VGBlogger.com"}
