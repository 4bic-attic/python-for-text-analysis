Senate President\n\n   Resolution passed in error says Marafa No delay in screening ministers \u2013 SPresident  By Ikechukwu Okaforadi and Umar Muhammad Puma There was mild drama yesterday as the senate resumed sitting after a long recess with the All Progressives Congress APC senators who are challenging the leadership of Senator Bukola Saraki as the Senate President disrupting plenary even as eighty three senators from across party line passed vote of confidence on the principal officers of the upper chambers as presently composed The commotion started when the anti Saraki senators through its spokesman Kabiru Marafa APC Zamfara raised a point of order 525 and 538 through which he challenged the legality of the Senate leadership According to senator Marafa the senate erred against the Senate standing order by passing a confidence vote on the Senate President and other principal officers even when the Senate Unity Forum led by senator Ahmed Lawan are still challenging the legality of the senate leadership According to senator Marafa the Senate Standing Order 525 forbade the lawmakers from making any mention of any matter that is still pending before the court adding that the confidence vote on Saraki by the eighty three senators was a subjudice and contempt of court Efforts by the Senate President Bukola Saraki to refer senator Marafa to Senate standing Order 526 rather aggravated the tension as Marafa began to openly challenge the Senate President saying there is no order in the Senate in the first place However things got worsened when another senator suggested that Marafa should be taken out of the chambers as he practically made to exchange blows with the senator in question but for the intervention of the leader of the anti Saraki senator Ahmed Lawan and other members of the Senate Unity Forum including senators Olusola Adeyeye APC Osun Gbenga Ashafa APC Lagos Barnabas Gemade APC Benue among others At this point the lawmakers belonging to the fold of the Senate Unity Forum led Marafa out of the chambers to his office though he later returned to the chambers Speaking shortly after orderliness returned in the chambers the Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu threatened that this will be the last time the senate session would be disrupted by any senator Ekweremadu said the Senate has the powers to stiffly punish any senator who disrupts its session according to the standing order is office though he later returned to the chambers He recalled that the only time the senate invoked its disciplinary powers since 1999 was when Senator Arthur Nzeribe was becoming unruly in the chambers The Deputy Senate President while apologising on behalf of Senator Marafa for his actions warned that any time such situation repeats itself the senate will have to apply its powers He urged all the aggrieved senators to put behind their grievances and work for a united house such as to move the country forward adding that though every senator is elected to represent a constituency such representation must be done with decorum and responsibility M eanwhile while moving the motion that the Senate do pass a vote of confidence on the Senate President Senator David Umaru APC Niger said the 1999 constitution as amended guarantees the separation of power and the independence of the legislative arm of government He emphasised that the Senate will continue to defend Nigeria\u2019s democracy and rule of law by performing its constitutional duties and responsibilities \u201cThe Senate notes with dismay the attempt and continued interference in the internal affairs of the Senate by detractors and media propaganda against senators the Senate and its leadership by selfish politicians especially considering the on-going unwarranted embarrassment and aspersions being cast on the Senate and its leadership \u201cThe Senate shall not allow itself to be distracted deterred or succumb to cheap blackmail in the course of carrying out its constitutional responsibilities by any individual or group of people under any pretense or guise for personal political interest\u201d senator Umaru said B riefing journalists yesterday after the plenary session the Senate\u2019s spokesman Deno Melaye said the Senate will commence the screening of appointees from President Mohammadu Buhari immediately it receives the list He warned that this time around screening of ministers will not be business as usual or \u2018bow and go\u2019 saying that the Senate will this time subject them to due diligence and scrutiny to ensure that the right candidates are selected and appointed I n a related development a pro democracy group Ohanaeze Ndi-Igbo Youth Movement ONYM yesterday stormed the National Assembly complex in Abuja in support of the Senate President Bukola Saraki and the Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu President of the group Mr Uche Nnadi told newsmen that the rally to the National Assembly was also to protest the use of anti-corruption war by politicians for personal gains \u201cThis despair is caused by the fact that the anti-corruption war which Nigeria in general and Igbo youths have keyed into is being misused by few political elite to fight their political war \u201cWe must state categorically that it is an act of corruption to use the anti-corruption war for party politics and political benefits\u2019\u2019 Nnadi said He faulted the trial of Saraki by the Code of Conduct Tribunal saying that he was being persecuted because his emergence as Senate President allowed an Igbo man to be the Deputy Senate President According to Nnadi the trial of the Senate President by the code of conduct Tribunal is in contravention of section 3d of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act \u201cThe same Chairman of the Tribunal Mr Danladi Umar ruled in favour of the principle in section 3d on the November 30 2011 in the case against Tinubu \u201cAnd today is insisting on trying the Senate President We know that Mr Danladi Umar cannot overrule himself\u2019\u2019 he said Nnadi therefore urged the tribunal to quash the charges against the Senate President and discharge him He added that Saraki\u2019s trial was quickly contrived to force him out of office \u201cOtherwise why will all this political tension when the man has not been found guilty \u201cOur law still upholds a man as innocent until he is found guilty\u2019\u2019 he said The protesters displayed placards with write-ups \u201cNo to Witch-hunting\u2019\u2019 and \u201cNo to Plot To Destabilize National Assembly\u2019\u2019 M eanwhile the Senate President has promised that there will be no delay in the screening of ministerial nominees even as he faces opposition from his political opponents He also urged senators to get ready for thorough screening of ministerial nominees to be forwarded to the senate this week Saraki in the address said though he was being persecuted by some forces outside the senate for being the Senate President screening of the ministerial nominees by the senate under his leadership  will not be visited with any form of political vendetta He said \u201cAs we await the list of ministerial nominees this week I believe the presence of ministers will create the space for greater policy engagement with the Executive Arm of government and enable us to begin to respond in a more systematic manner to the various economic and social challenges before us especially through our various Committees that will also be constituted soon \u201cOn this note I want to urge you all my colleagues to ensure that what is uppermost in our minds as we begin the constitutional task of screening of ministerial nominees is the overall interest of our country informed by the enormity and the urgency of the challenges before us \u201cOnce the list is submitted let us ensure that we treat it with dispatch and thoroughness We must not be held down by unnecessary politicking The enormity of our national challenges at this time does not give room for pettiness or politics of vendetta\u201d Saraki had earlier in the speech made reference to his recent arraignment at the Code of Conduct Tribunal  CCT on alleged false assets declaration saying \u201cI wish to reiterate my remarks before the Tribunal that I have no iota of doubt that I am on trial today because I am the president of the Nigerian Senate against the wishes of some powerful individuals outside this Chambers\u201d He added that what was clear to him  is that no amount of persecution  will make senators who freely elected him as their leader to abandon him and allow outside forces to dictate what they should do for them His words \u201cBut what is clear to me also is that the laws of Nigeria and the rules of the National Assembly give consideration only to the wishes and desires of those of you who are here today as members of the Senate to elect as you wish one of your peers as President of the Senate This in your wisdom is what you have done by electing me to be the first among all of you who are my equals\u201d", "source": "Uncova"}
