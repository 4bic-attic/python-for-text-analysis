His arrival followed that of Argentinian defender Ramiro Funes Mori from River Plate for \u00a39.5million. \n\nWinger Matt Jarvis joined Norwich on loan for the season from West Ham but  Bradley Johnson left Carrow Road to join Derby for an undisclosed fee. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nAston Villa loaned left-back Joe Bennett to Bournemouth but recruited fellow defenders Tiago Ilori and  Joleon Lescott. \n\nBennett was joined at Bournemouth by central defender Tomas Andrade, on loan until the end of the season from River Plate, and striker Glenn Murray on a three-year contract from Crystal Palace. \n\nMichael Hector joined Chelsea from Reading and was immediately loaned back, while fellow central defender Papy Djilobodji joined the champions from Nantes. \n\nSouthampton finally secured the signing of Virgil van Dijk from Celtic, who replaced him with Croatia Under-21 defender Jozo Simunovic. \n\n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Mid-Ulster Mail"}
