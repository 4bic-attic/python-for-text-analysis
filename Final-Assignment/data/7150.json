This new technology is designed for innovative producers seeking greater plant productivity and ease of nutrient application. \n  \nThe practice of fertigation (applying fertilizer to crops through irrigation systems) provides similar benefits; coinciding nutrient delivery with crop demand. The use of fertigation often leads to stronger healthier plants, increases in water and nutrient use efficiencies, reduced labor and expense associated with nutrient application, less strain on the environment and ultimately increases in crop productivity. Poor water quality, has limited the type of fertilizer that may be applied with fertigation. In particular, fertigation with phosphorus presents a challenge. \n \nPoor quality irrigation water may bind to the phosphorus, making it unavailable to the plant, and even worse, may cause scale build up in irrigation lines causing clogging of emitters (especially for drip, trickle, and micro-jet irrigation systems). \n \nNachurs Alpine Solutions answers these water quality challenges with the addition of polyamine technology to phosphorus-containing fertilizer in the Aqua-Tech family. Greg Bame, technical services for Nachurs Alpine Solutions said, the technology prevents cations from binding to phosphate, resulting in the reduction of occurrences of emitter plugging and the increase in plant nutrient uptake. \n \nEven as the fertilizer solution enters the root zone the polyamine technology continues to offer protection from phosphorus tie-up. \n \nFor more information, see a representative or visit www.nachurs.com .", "source": "High Plains Journal"}
