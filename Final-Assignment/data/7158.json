The report study is best suited for product manufacturers, technology solution providers, forums, alliances, and associations, technology investors among others. \n\nThe report focuses on the study of small UAV drones which are used for the commercial applications such as law enforcement/public safety, precision agriculture, media and entertainment, retail, inspection/monitoring, surveying/mapping, hobbyist and do-it-yourself (DIY), and education. Among all the commercial applications, precision agriculture application is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 42.25% during the forecast period. \n\nThe UAV drones market is dominated by the key players such as DJI ( China ), Parrot S.A. ( France ), 3D Robotics Inc. (U.S.), PrecisionHawk (U.S.) among others. \n\nKey Topics Covered:  \n\n1 Introduction \n\n2 Research Methodology \n\n3 Executive Summary \n\n4 Premium Insights \n\n5 Market Overview \n\n6 Industry Trends \n\n7 UAV Drones Market, By Type \n\n8 UAV Drones Market, By Application \n\n9 UAV Drones Market, By Geography \n\n10 Competitive Landscape \n\n11 Company Profiles \n\n- 3D Robotics, Inc. \n- Aerovironment, Inc. \n- Airware, Inc. \n- DJI \n- Drone Deploy \n- Hoovy LLC \n- Parrot S.A. \n- Precisionhawk \n- Trimble UAS \n- Vdos Global LLC \n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/46zr94/uav_drones_market  \n \nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uav-drones-law-enforcement-precision-agriculture-media-and-entertainment-retail-market-2015-2020-dji-parrot-3d-robotics--precisionhawk-dominate-the-559-billion-industry-300149711.html \n \nSOURCE  Research and Markets \n \nCopyright 2014 PR Newswire.
