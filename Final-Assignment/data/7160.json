The greenback's \"status as a funding currency or as a safe-haven currency for that matter is lost\", wrote Juckes in his daily morning note. \"Instead, it's a barometre of the global mood.\"\n\nDue to the fact that longer-dated US Treasuries command a sizable premium relative to most debt denominated in other major currencies, the greenback's role as a funding currency has been largely supplanted by the euro.\n\n\"At the moment, significant further dollar strength is dependent on both longer-dated US yields and equities rising.,\" wrote Juckes. \"That's possible on a quiet day like today, but if we get back to more risk-averse markets, the dollar is unlikely to out-perform the yen and euro, even as all three do well against everything else.\"\n\nCommodities\n\nCopper led losses in industrial metals and zinc fell to a five-year low on concern that a weakening economy will reduce demand in China, the world's biggest metals user.\n\nCopper for delivery in three months dropped 3.6 per cent to settle at $US5078 a metric ton ($US2.30 a pound) at 5.51pm n London, after touching $US5036, the lowest since August 27.

S&P materials, down 1.8 per cent, led the decline for the S&P 500, but the selloff was broad-based, with all 10 major sectors lower.\n\nShares of Volkswagen suppliers BorgWarner, Honeywell and Delphi Automotive fell after the German car maker admitted to cheating on vehicle emission tests.

I'm completely unable to give a time horizon when this may end; it's a pretty scary picture.
