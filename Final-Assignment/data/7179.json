Two years after spending the built-in family holiday , Zeta-Jones and Douglas are thoroughly back together after a  and have spent 2015 crisscrossing the globe together as a unit. \n\nWhich seemingly would make for a much nicer joint birthday party this weekend, right? \n Jean Catuffe/GC Images   \n\"We had a little bump in the road,\" Douglas  in\u00a0 Event magazine. \"The problem in this business is that everything is so public.\" \n\nThe Ant-Man star added, \"I love Catherine as much, more than I ever have. And hopefully the feeling's mutual...We worked things out\u2014if both people want to work something out and make it better, you can do it.
