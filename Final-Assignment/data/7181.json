Bottom line: None of them are going to be a JFK. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because even JFK wasn\u2019t the JFK of space-advocate fantasies. We live in a democratic Republic, and we\u2019re not going to do Apollo again, to Mars or anywhere else. The best we can hope for is a president who recognizes the value of high-leverage space technology needed to reduce costs, and will fund those things necessary to support it during his or her term.", "source": "Transterrestrial Musings"}
