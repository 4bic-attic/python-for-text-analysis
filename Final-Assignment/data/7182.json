If not, let us prove it to you. Trevor MacDonald is a self identified female-to-male transgendered gay man, who\u2019s given birth to two children since he transitioned. He\u2019s expecting another baby in April.\u00a0MacDonald explains he was born female but transitioned to male by taking hormones and having chest surgery. \u201cWhen my partner and I decided to start a family, we got advice from my doctors and I stopped taking my testosterone. Because my surgery removed most of my breast tissue, I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ll be able to breastfeed, but I really want to try.\u201d He\u2019s accused the midwifery community of \u201ctransphobia\u201d in The Huffington Post.\u00a0MacDonald argues that suggesting that trans guys who give birth are not men \u2014 but actually women, because of their biology \u2014 is \u201chighly offensive to trans individuals because it denies our gender.\u201d Some midwife organizations have already begun to remove offensive references that suggest that mothers are women, moving to instead call them \u201cpregnant people\u201d and \u201cbirthing individuals.\u201d However, in a sign that all may not be lost in our culture, some midwifes, mothers and experts are pushing back. There is no such thing as \u201ctransphobia.\u201d Normal people who have not been indoctrinated into the poison of political correctness rightly reject transsexuals as abnormal, and that is a natural reaction to an unnatural behavior \u2013 not evidence of some sort of mental illness, as attaching a \u201c-phobia\u201d to it would suggest. And a culture which enforces behavior like Trevor McDonald\u2019s as normal (someone who calls herself a man and yet still bears children is not, in any serious sense, normal) rather than enforcing a rejection of such behavior is not a culture in ascendance. It\u2019s a culture in decline, and swift decline at that. Also see...\nThe Liberal Vision For The Poor Vs.
