She had a wonderful time and she\u2019s still talking about it now. \n \n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s visit was quite special. When she realised who it was, her jaw dropped. They had a good 20-minute chat, which was very sweet of the mayor.\u201d \n \nMrs Caterham was born in Wiltshire in 1909 and, from the ages of 18 to 21, worked as an au pair for a miltary family in India. \n \nOn her return to Britain, she met and married Norman Caterham, who went on to become a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Pay Corps. His postings led to the family travelling extensively across Europe, Asia and North America. \n \nMrs Caterham only stopped driving at the age of 97 and was a regular bridge player until a few years ago. \n \n\u201cShe still does an awful lot for herself,\u201d Mrs Gaisford said. \u201cShe\u2019s quite a phenomenon. \n \n\u201cI told her she would end up in the Guinness Book of Records, but she just takes it all in her stride.\u201d", "source": "Get Surrey"}
