Nepal's government has a target of 6 percent growth in the budget for the current fiscal year. \n\nAccording to ADB's Macroeconomic Update released here on Thursday, the growth rate is possible on the back of agricultural growth, pace of reconstruction work and revival of tourism. \n\nADB Country Director Kenichi Yokoyama said, \"The goal would be met if the growth rate of agriculture sector increased by 2.5 percent and the non-agriculture sector by 7.7 percent.\" \n\nBeside agriculture, the pace of reconstruction works and tourism revival followed by the April 25 massive earthquake are the major elements for economic growth. It has also mentioned other indicators like infrastructure development, improvement of the service sector and increased flow of remittance. \n\nHowever, ADB warned that the target could not be met if the political unrest continued and the monsoon rainfall became unfavorable. \n\nMeanwhile, the Manila-based multilateral donor has projected inflation to grow by 9.5 percent in worst scenario and 8.5 percent in better supply.", "source": "Individual.com"}
