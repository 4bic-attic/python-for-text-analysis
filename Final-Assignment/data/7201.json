Now, Catalonia faces its own destiny.\u201d \n \nSunday\u2019s election was for Catalonia\u2019s 135-member parliament, located in the region\u2019s capital Barcelona. \n \nBy early afternoon, around 35% of those eligible to vote had cast their ballots, more than 5% more than in the previous regional election, the government said. \n \nRegional spokeswoman Meritxell Borras said postal votes cast by Catalans living overseas could also have an important impact. \n \nMas and the other secessionists argue that if they win 68 seats, the result would give them a democratic mandate to initiate an 18-month plan to split from Spain that could include a unilateral declaration of independence. \n \nThe central government of Mariano Rajoy says it will use all legal means to prevent Catalonia from breaking away, an exit European leaders warn would include ejection from the EU. \n \nSpain\u2019s government has also said it is concerned that if Catalonia tries to break free it would disrupt the fragile signs of economic recovery for the country that has endured unemployment of over 22% for several years. \n \nWhile most Catalans support a vote on independence to decide the divisive question, polls have forecast a slim win for the separatist parties. \n \nThey also indicate that Mas\u2019 leading bloc of separatist parties Together for Yes will likely need the support of the extreme left-wing CUP to cobble together a majority of seats needed to launch their push to sever century-old links with the rest of Spain. \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
