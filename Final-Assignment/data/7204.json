The MTA is suggesting those who can avoid traveling to New York City during this time do so, since many street closures near those locations will result in traffic congestion and pedestrian diversions. \n \nCustomers taking the New York City Subway, Metro -North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road for papal events should buy round-trip\u00a0MetroCards\u00a0or train tickets in advance and expect some crowding. \n \nMTA Metro -North Railroad will have additional trains and crews stationed in Grand Central Terminal. \n \nMetro -North will run a normal schedule on Thursday, Sept. 24. On Friday, Sept. 25 , the railroad will operate three additional inbound trains, leaving Poughkeepsie on the Hudson Line at 10:37 a.m. ; leaving Southeast on the Harlem Line at 10:08 a.m. ; and leaving Fairfield Metro on the New Haven Line at 11:00 a.m. Some earlier trains will be combined and canceled to provide crews and equipment for those trains; details on those service changes will be available at\u00a0 www.mta.info/mnr . \n    \nThe post appeared first on Milford Mirror .", "source": "Milford Mirror"}
