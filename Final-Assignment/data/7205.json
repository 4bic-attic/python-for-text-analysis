He was therefore fully aware of my status as a so-called 'non-dom',\" he said. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nAsked if Mr Cameron had been damaged by the revelations, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think the British people had their verdict on David Cameron's premiership just a couple of months ago at the General Election and they re-elected him because he is a strong leader who has led this country out of economic turmoil to economic success. \n \n\"Britain is walking tall on the world stage again and (I'm) frankly not going to dignify that book with a more detailed response.\"", "source": "Ealing Times"}
