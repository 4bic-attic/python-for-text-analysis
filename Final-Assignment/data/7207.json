It did say the 3.5km Family Walk is still scheduled to proceed, provided the PSI level at 8am is below 150. \n  Image taken from POSB PAssion Run for Kids Facebook page.   \nFor the participants of the competitive races, they may collect their medals at the carnival. Alternatively, they can collect the medals at a later date and organisers will announce more details \"shortly\", it added. \n\n\"Like you, we are disappointed as we have been looking forward to the run. However, your health and safety are of utmost importance to us, and we seek your kind understanding,\" POSB said, adding that the carnival is still on. \n\nCulture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong will be at the event to launch a SG50 commmemorative book that envisions what the country will be like in the next 50 years, the organisers said. \n\nThis cancellation follows in the heels of another event that was cancelled due to the haze. The Singtel - Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) Race Against Cancer was called off on Saturday due to the worsening air quality here. \n\n- CNA/kk", "source": "Channel NewsAsia"}
