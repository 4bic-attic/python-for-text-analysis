The old retaining wall on the south side of the Pierce School Lofts is being rebuilt, and the developers are taking extra pains to make sure it complements the historic district. \n\n\u201cIt was rotted railroad ties and crumbling concrete,\u201d said Tim Baldwin, who is partnering with Pat Sherman to transform the old school. \u201cWe\u2019re using manufactured block that is made to look like cut stone. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll apply an acid etch and stain to give it a limestone color.\u201d \n\nThe project, which is getting $708,000 in housing tax credits through Iowa\u2019s Economic Development Authority, has a total price tag of $8 million to $9 million. \n\nWhen finished next summer, the property at 2212 E. 12th St., will contain 41 housing units. \n\n\u201cEverything is getting state and federal approval, because of the tax credits,\u201d Baldwin said Thursday. \u201cWe can\u2019t use the credits for the new wall or the parking lot, though.\u201d \n\nThe Economic Development Authority has a specific list, called Qualified Reimbursable Expenses, for the portions of the project where tax credits can be used. Other rules also apply, and the partners have made changes to the development to make sure they comply. \n\n\u201cWe really wanted to do a rooftop deck,\u201d Baldwin said of the portion of the school that was added to the historic property in the 1970s. \u201cWe thought it would be a beautiful viewing area for the turn on the (Quad-City Times) Bix 7.\u201d \n\nBut it was not possible to provide access to the roof that would comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. \n\n\u201cInstead, we\u2019ve designed the parking-lot layout in a way that creates a space for permanent bench seats with historic features around it,\u201d Baldwin said. \n\nWhen finished, Pierce School Lofts will contain large, primarily one- and two-bedroom apartments. The units will be considerably larger, Baldwin said, than those inside the former Democrat building on Brady Street, which Baldwin and Sherman also rehabbed. \n\nThe pair recently decided to add a studio unit, because the smaller, less-expensive living options have become increasingly popular in historic makeovers, Baldwin said. \n \n\u201cThe one bedrooms can go for $900 plus and the two-bedroom units can run from $1,300 to $1,400,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lower studio pricing is in demand.\u201d \n\nThe target date for opening Pierce was June 2016, but the project is ahead of pace. \n\n\u201cAs it stands now, we\u2019re running a couple months early,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe could hit some snags in the winter, but we\u2019re in good shape now. \n\n\u201cEverything is framed in, and we\u2019ll be hanging (sheet) rock in the next couple of months, and the electrical, plumbing and HVAC are roughed-in.\u201d \n\nBaldwin said he has been \u201cdisheartened\u201d by one element of the work: Someone has been shooting a BB gun through some of the windows, which have been, \u201cliterally re-handcrafted. \n\n\u201cEventually, the building is going to have a sophisticated security system, but, for now, we\u2019ve asked the police to help us keep an eye on things. \n\n\u201cThis project is going to clean up the neighborhood so much.\u201d", "source": "QC Times"}
