I'm completely baffled. You know it's gay pride. You knew you agreed when you sent the contract in and took the money.\" \n\n\nHowever, on Monday (07Sep15), the Loyal hitmaker, who was in Georgia for his One Hell of A Nite Tour, hit back at the allegations and set the record straight, insisting the booking was never confirmed. \n\n\nBrown also made it clear he appreciates all the support he receives from his lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) fans, writing, \"I wasn't aware or informed of a show I supposedly canceled. I have nothing but love and respect for the LGBT COMMUNITY. \n\n\n\"The show was never confirmed by any of my people. So I apologize if the fans wanted me there. I honestly wasn't booked for the show. Hopefully in the future we can do it right. Much love LGBT\".", "source": "Young HollyWood.com"}
