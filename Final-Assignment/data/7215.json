Henson, another black nominee in the category, stood and applauded Davis\u2019 win. Other African-American actresses who prevailed Sunday were Uzo Aduba and Regina King, who won for supporting performances. \n \n\u201cMad Men\u201d star Hamm claimed the best drama actor Emmy that eluded him seven times before. He bypassed the steps to the Emmy stage, scrambling onto it on his stomach. \n \n\u201cThere has been a terrible mistake, clearly,\u201d said Hamm, who played troubled ad man Don Draper in the series that ended its run without adding another best-drama trophy to its haul of four previous wins. \n \nIt lost to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which became only the second so-called \u201cgenre\u201d series, after sci-fi drama \u201cLost,\u201d to win. \n \nPeter Dinklage nabbed the best supporting drama actor award for \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which also won writing and directing trophies. Tracy Morgan, the actor-comedian seriously injured last year in a car accident, made a triumphant return to reveal \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d the best drama series. \n \nHost Andy Samberg noted that the 67th Emmys coincided with the 67th birthday for George R.R. Martin, whose novels are the basis for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d A smiling Martin was in the theatre audience to accept the congratulations, and was onstage for the big win. \n \nOn the comedy side, political satire \u201cVeep\u201d claimed the top series award that had gone to \u201cModern Family\u201d for five consecutive years. \n \nJon Stewart is gone from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d but not forgotten by Emmy voters, who gave the late-night show the best variety talk series award Sunday over another host who\u2019s moved on, Stephen Colbert. \n \nStewart, who left the \u201cDaily Show\u201d earlier this year, warned the theatre audience that the perils of leaving TV include no applause or free food. \n \n\u201cTo everybody on television, I just want to tell you, cling to it as long as you can,\u201d joked Stewart, who\u2019s turning over \u201cDaily Show\u201d to Trevor Noah. \n \nBesides Colbert, who left his Comedy Central show to become host of CBS\u2019 late-night show, the tough competition included another channel alum, John Oliver. \n \n\u201cTransparent\u201d emerged as an early winner at Sunday\u2019s Emmy Awards, capturing a best comedy actor trophy for Jeffrey Tambor and a directing award for its creator, and giving both winners a chance to pay tribute to the show\u2019s trangender themes. \n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to dedicate my performance and this award to the transgender community. \u2026 Thanks for letting us be part of the change,\u201d said Tambor, who plays a man journeying toward womanhood. \n \nJill Soloway, who based the series on the life of her own \u201cmoppa,\u201d as she calls her parent, used her directing trophy acceptance speech to ask for equal rights for transgender individuals. \n \n\u201cIt is legal in the majority of U.S. states to refuse to rent to trans people,\u201d she said, saying the country has a civil rights problem that must be addressed. \n \nAduba won the supporting actress in a drama trophy for \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d which was switched under academy rules this year from comedy competition. Aduba won a guest actress award last year for her portrayal of \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d in the series. \n \nEmmys voters didn\u2019t give up their fondness for choosing the familiar over the groundbreaking in other categories as well. \n \nJulia Louis-Dreyfus was honoured as best lead comedy actress for \u201cVeep\u201d for the fourth time. Allison Janney of \u201cMom\u201d and Tony Hale of \u201cVeep\u201d were repeat winners for supporting comedy acting honours. \n \nJanney, who plays a dysfunctional parent, thanked series producer Chuck Lorre for creating a deeply flawed character and \u201cthinking of me to play her.\u201d \n \n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d said Tony Hale, thanking his show\u2019s writers and lauding his fellow nominees: \u201cYou make me laugh hard.\u201d \n \n\u201cOlive Kitteridge,\u201d based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Elizabeth Strout, nearly swept the limited series categories, with six trophies including the top award and lead acting honours for Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins and a supporting award for Bill Murray. \n \nKing of \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d won supporting actress honours for a limited series. \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d won for best variety sketch series. \n \n\u201cThe Voice\u201d won a best reality series trophy, breaking the hold that \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d long had on the category and snaring an award that always eluded \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d \n \nSamberg kicked off the ceremony with a video in which he made elaborate fun of the overload of TV programs available. \n \n\u201cSo many shows, so little,\u201d he sang, before entering a \u201cTV viewing bunker\u201d to binge-view on all the nominated shows. A bearded, shaggy-haired Samberg emerged to boast to contenders Jon Hamm and Kerry Washington that he had them and everyone else covered. \n \nAppearing on stage, groomed, Samberg touched briefly on the political scene. \n \n\u201cSure, Donald Trump seems racist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else?\u201d \n \n___ \n \nOnline: http://www.emmys.com", "source": "News 1130"}
