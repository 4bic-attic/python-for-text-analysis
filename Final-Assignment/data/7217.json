This week it held that \"the EPA lacked substantial evidence to support its conclusion\" about its use on crops. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The EPA and Dow argue that since the studies are inconclusive as to the risks of sulfoxaflor for bees, the studies affirmatively prove that sulfoxaflor does not cause unreasonable adverse effects on bees,\" U.S. Circuit Judge Mary Schroeder wrote. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Neither logic nor precedent can sustain this position. We have previously held that an agency cannot rely on ambiguous studies as evidence of a conclusion that the studies do not support,\" she continued. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The panel vacated the EPA's ruling for further studies about how the pesticide affects bees. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Schroeder was joined by U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt, sitting by designation, and U.S. Circuit Judge N. Randy Smith, who issued a concurring opinion. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am inclined to believe the EPA instead decided to register sulfoxaflor unconditionally in response to public pressure for the product and attempted to support its decision retroactively with studies it had previously found inadequate,\" Smith wrote. \"Such action seems capricious.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petitioners in the action were the Pollinator Stewardship Council, American Honey Producers Association, National Honey Bee Advisory Board, American Beekeeping Federation, and beekeepers Thomas R. Smith, Bret Adee and Jeffery Anderson. \u00a0", "source": "Courthouse News Service"}
