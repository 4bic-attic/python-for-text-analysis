He tried to lose weight all the time\u2014every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. \n \n\u201cIn every corner of our house, there was no wall space,\u201d Lerman says. \u201c[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad\u2019s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.\u201d \n \nLerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family\u2014her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as \u201cLeggo My Eggo\u201d and \u201cFly the Friendly Skies\u201d\u2014was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman\u2019s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. \n \nLerman\u2019s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they\u2019d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat \u201clike ladies.\u201d \n \n\u201cMy grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,\u201d \u00a0 Lerman says. \u201cIf it smells, if it has an aroma\u2014it\u2019s going to transform your world.\u201d \n \nOnce Lerman\u2019s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. \n \n\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,\u201d Lerman says. \u201cI had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister\u2026and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.\u201d \n \nLerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty\u2019s \u201cthrow it in\u201d style or her baker Aunt Jeannie\u2019s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie\u2019s healthy \u201cswaps\u201d (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. \n \nBut despite food\u2019s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman\u2019s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn\u2019t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. \n \n\u201cWhile working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,\u201d she says. \u201cI worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children\u2019s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.\u201d However, it wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. \u201cI realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,\u201d she says. \n \nThis creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter\u2019s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, \u201c Snacking Outside the Box ,\u201d for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter\u2019s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. \n \n\u201cMy daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,\u201d she says. \u201cWe made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.\u201d \n \nAfter her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: \u201cThat\u2019s not your story. We want to hear about your family.\u201d So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times\u2019 \u00a0 \u201cWell\u201d blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. \n \nLerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she\u2019d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process \u201cnerve-wracking.\u201d However, her father\u2019s response after reading the book was: \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way baby,\u201d a tagline he\u2019d created for Virginia Slims. \n \nLerman has found that her story resonates with many; she\u2019s received letters from people all over the world who\u2019ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. \n \n\u201cMy story is everybody\u2019s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,\u201d Lerman says. \u201cInstill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body. What we put in our body is how we\u2019re going to live our lives. You\u2019ve got to treat your body well.\u201d \n \nTo learn more about\u00a0Dawn Lerman, visit  penguin.com ! \n \nThe post appeared first on New York Family Magazine .", "source": "New York Family Magazine"}
