The report expects 495,000 homes and condos to sell by the end of 2015; a 3.3% increase over 2014. That number is second only to the pre-recession period in 2007, when 521,894 homes were sold. Price growth in 2015 is projected to increase 6.2% year-over-year to $433,600.

Outside Ontario and British Columbia, sales are up a more modest two percent.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, it is projected that 495,000 homes and condos will exchange hands nationally, a slight decrease over 2015 levels. The national average price, on the other hand, is forecast to climb by two percent to a record $442,400. The continued increase comes on the heels of strengthening economic prospects.\n\n\u201cContinued low interest rates will support home sales and ongoing price trends. That\u2019s good news for first-time home buyers or those looking to refinance or consolidate their debt,\u201d Aggarwal concludes. \n\nCanadalend.com is one of the largest, most trusted private mortgage brokers in Canada, with skilled independent, licensed professionals helping Canadians coast-to-coast.
