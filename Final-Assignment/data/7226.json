Your organization can help satisfy our cravings for community and connections by delivering conference experiences that foster connexity. \n \nConnexity is more than speed networking. It is more than just an evening reception or party. It is a tech term for the merging of community and connections. And it is one of the main reasons people attend your conference. \n Face to Face Interactions Are A Premium  \nAs you plan your conference, you have to be intentional about designing experiences that foster connexity. It shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought. Nor should it be something that you hope happens at the opening reception.

And it\u2019s a strategic priority that you should invest time and money into designing, implementing and nurturing. \n Free Connexity Webinar  \nJoin me September 9 at 2 pm Eastern to discover how to create a connexity game plan.
