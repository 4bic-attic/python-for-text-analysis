[Citylab for 9/15/2015]\n\nThe flow of undocumented immigrants has been essentially\u00a0flat since 2010. There is no flood of people crossing our supposedly porous border. [Debates on U.S. Immigration, ed. Judith Gans, Elaine M. Replogle, Daniel Tichenor.]\n\nThere is no huge budget crisis looming because of Medicare and Social Security. [Henry J. Aaron writing for Brookings, article entitled \"Why Projections of Rising Budget Deficits are a Myth.\"]\n\nEspecially in a presidential election year, if you want to argue for change of political party, you apparently have to argue that things are bad and getting worse. Lots of things really are bad and getting worse: the Syrian refugee crisis, home grown white racist terrorism\u00a0in the U.S., gridlocked government, and elected public officials who claim the right to pick and choose which laws to obey. But the Republican field is trying hard to get the base revved up over things\u00a0than aren't legitimate\u00a0issues.\n\nSuch an Alice-in-Wonderland world we live in.", "source": "Pam Klainer's Day"}
