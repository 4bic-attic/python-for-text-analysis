I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you're shooting in June, I have to say no' - because that's when we were shooting Con Man, and I couldn't figure out how to reschedule it.\" \n \nHowever the stars aligned when Edwards told him he wouldn't be needed on the film's Pinewood Studios set, and whilst Tudyk didn\u2019t divulge any plot spoilers, he did reveal that the majority of his scenes are with Diego Luna and Felicity Jones and added \"It's more fun on a movie set than I've had in a very long time, \"I didn't know what to expect. I really like my fellow cast-members - Diego Luna and Felicity Jones, I see them a lot, most of my scenes are with them. And Gareth is great. \n \n\n \nThere's always those days that are really hard. You're wet, you're cold, it's way early... there's some interesting things when you're on-set that can be challenging. \n \nBut when you get into that moment of, 'This is hard, this is terrible, I'm miserable' and then you're like, 'Oh look, it's Star Wars!' and that feeling is immediately erased. It doesn't last for a breath - you can't even get it out without going, 'But look over there! And look at that!'\" \n \nStar Wars Anthology: Rogue One hits cinemas in December next year. \n \nAlan Tudyk Profile |\u00a0 Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One Film Page \n \nSTAR WARS ANTHOLOGY: ROGUE ONE HITS CINEMAS DECEMBER 2", "source": "Fan Carpet"}
