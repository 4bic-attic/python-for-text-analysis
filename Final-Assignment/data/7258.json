It claims to be the country\u2019s largest, producing 5000 tonnes per day. \n \n\u201cWe are a new brand but we are focused on the quality of cement and fulfilling market demand,\u201d said the company\u2019s managing director. The firm aims to double its production to 10,000 tonnes of cement per day by next year. \n \nFor the time being the company plans to focus on meeting growing domestic demand rather than exports, he added. \n \nA number of other cement manufacturers are looking to increase their local presence. Thai-based Siam Cement Group (SCG) is building a 1.8 million tonne plant in Mon State, aiming to have it open next year. \n \nSeveral companies also import their products to Myanmar. \n \nDaw Zin Mar Lwin, owner of Pyi Kyaw construction materials wholesale, said Double Rhinos has a good price, which has attracted many customers. \n \n\u201cThe price is K1000 cheaper per bag for Double Rhinos, though old brands like SCG are still popular, as all cement is expensive and quality matters,\u201d she said.", "source": "Myanmar Times"}
