I have had enough conversations with other wallflowers who are struggling to bloom because they keep themselves hidden from the light of truth and the water of nourishment in accepting who they are. \n \nThey compare their gifts.\u00a0They compare their ability to be a good mother.\u00a0They compare their love stories.\u00a0They listen to \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and \u201cwhat if nots\u201d.\u00a0They cannot accept their uniqueness. They look to where they are not yet, so they stop and stunt their growth. \n \nThey wait and wonder \u2013 when will the insecurities go away?\u00a0When will the fear erase?\u00a0When will the comparing stop? \n \nWhen will someone else give me enough confidence to be\u2026me? \n \nOn our property we have several franji panji plants also known as Plumerias.\u00a0About 350 days a year they look like a stick. These tall sticks if you will appear lifeless, brown and sort of\u00a0barren. But then when it\u2019s the right time, they bloom.\u00a0They bloom pink with a yellow center, sometimes purple and white and\u00a0most fragrant cocoa butter smell you have ever inhaled. \n \nThey are strung together on Hawaiian leis, given as crowns upon a brides head\u00a0and\u00a0are offered for special occasions as bouquets. \n \nI thought about these incredible petals,\u00a0these slow growing plants and how they don\u2019t apologize for blooming once a season. They don\u2019t apologize for their appearance when they aren\u2019t in full bloom. They don\u2019t wait for other trees or plants or shrubs to tell them what they are. They know their beauty and for what they are created to do and become. \n \nThey come forth when it\u2019s their time and do what only they can do. \n \nBeautifully displayed.\u00a0Timely.\u00a0Unique.\u00a0Fragrant. \n \nAren\u2019t these things we as women of God\u2019s creation are called to be? \n \nBeautifully displayed. \n \n\u201cOaks of righteousness, \na planting of the Lord \nfor the display of his splendor.\u201d Isaiah 61:3 \n \nTimely. \n \n\u201cHe has made everything beautiful in its time.\u201d Ecclesiastes 3:11 \n \nUnique. \n \n\u201cI praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. \nMy frame was not hidden from you\u00a0when I was made in the secret place, \nwhen I was woven together in the depths of the earth. \nYour eyes saw my unformed body; \nall the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.\u201d Psalm 139:15-16 \n \nFragrant. \n \n\u201cFor we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing\u201d 2 Corinthians 2:15 \n \nBut we forget.\u00a0We hide the beauty within, afraid that we are not enough.\u00a0We deny that we are special,\u00a0suppress that which is unique and\u00a0underestimate the time of which we are to bloom. \n \nWe cover our fragrance with insecurity and fear.\u00a0We wait for someone to give us permission to be who we are. We rob the world of knowing Christ through the uniqueness of our own life experience, our own unique story, our own fragrance. \n \nI love the franji panji \u2013 it will forever be my favorite flower.\u00a0I love that this delicate flower reminds me of the fragile earthen clay that I am made of holds endless treasure and beauty. \n \nI love that the sunset center of it\u2019s design reminds me of the beauty of the one who created it and that the same created me to also be on display for His glory. \n \nI love how it reminds me that everything is beautiful in it\u2019s time and that my being is created with a timely purpose. \n \nI love how it reminds me not to try to look or be like someone else but to be and live the truth of Psalm 139. \n \nI love that the fragrance reminds me to be a fragrant, a\u00a0sweet smelling offering\u00a0unto Him. \n \nMaybe you too need to be reminded that you are beautiful, unique, timely, special and fragrant. \n \nDon\u2019t wait for creation to tell you who you are or who you should be, be who the Creator called you to be.", "source": "98.5 KTIS"}
