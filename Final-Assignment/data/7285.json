Through this program and some other initiatives we\u2019re working to teach the parents and the students the language and make for a better learning environment.\u201dThe program starts out in kindergarten classrooms and works to integrate students every step all along the way.Lynn Steelman, an English as a Second Language specialist with the district said the schools are offering personalized classes for recent immigrants while working with all of the students in the ESL programs to make sure the language is catching on.In the Mel-NAP district the ESL courses are especially tough. Unlike most districts with large non-English speakers, teachers and administrators work with large populations speaking both variations of arabic languages and spanish. The school system has large hispanic and Yemeni population.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique situation,\u201d Soranno-Bond said. \u201cThe bilingual education program started last year with a company called Melcast that has really kickstarted the training here in Melvindale.\u201dThe language divide is tough for any non-English speaker to pick up, but according to Steelman it\u2019s even harder for the Yemeni immigrants because their language doesn\u2019t have any of the similar constructs that spanish and English share.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough various techniques and some sheltered instruction we are able to see this program working already.\u201dSteelman said the program is designed with teachers in mind.\u201c(It) provides a framework for teachers to work with students in their classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also helps with the native (English) speakers. It reinforces the academic vocabulary, which is not what is generally used in the home.\u201dDistrictwide the curriculum is changing quickly to keep up with the ever changing population. While the current population is about 38 percent non-native English speakers, the elementary schools are closer to 50 percent non-native English speakers.\u201cWe\u2019re adapting with the times.\u201d Soranno-Bond said.", "source": "Heritage News-Herald"}
