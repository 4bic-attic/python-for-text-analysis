Enjoy. \n \nYou\u2019ll thank me the next time you\u2019re out drunk at 5am and realize you have a coupon in your wallet for a free Waffle House waffle . Though to be honest if you\u2019re thinking about coupons at the crack of dawn while intoxicated, you deserve some massive props. \n \nThe coupon doesn\u2019t expire until Sept. 24, 2015 so there\u2019s no rush on killing those brain cells. Note the coupon is only valid Mon-Fri. \n \nAlso it\u2019s worth noting that most (all?) Waffle House\u2019s (Hice?) will accept mobile coupons. That means instead of printing the coupon, pulling the coupon up on your mobile browser in the restaurant should work just fine. \n \n\u00a9 Hey, It's Free!\u2122 LLC, All rights reserved.
