The National Board of Revenue (NBR) introduced the centre. \n \nThe tax center will provide services from September 6-10 to the officials of the secretariat during office hours. \n \nMuhith also suggested the tax authorities to encourage people instead of forcing them to pay tax. \n \nAmong the 16 crore population, only 17 lakh pay tax which is shameful, the minister said, adding that the number has to be raised to 30lakh. \n \nState Minister for Finance and Planning MA Mannan and Cabinet Secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan attended the programme as special guests with NBR Chairman Md Nojibur Rahman as chair. \n \n\u201cWe are building teamwork to increase the revenue collection for the government,\u201d said MA Mannan. \n \nHe also said the income tax fair and establishment of tax information and service centre have already positive impact on expediting the revenue collection. \n \nThe NBR chairman said the centre was established to give information to secretariat officials and employees over submitting their tax returns. However, other people visiting secretariat can take service from the centre as well. \n \nFrom the current fiscal, the government officials are now liable to pay income tax on their income from bonus and festival allowances, along with the basic pay.\u00a0", "source": "Dhaka Tribune"}
