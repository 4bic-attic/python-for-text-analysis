There is an old saying that says that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This doesn\u2019t mean that buyer assistance programs are not true, or good for homebuyers, it just means that there is more to assistance than free money to buy a home. There is no such thing as free money, and no amount of buyer assistance will allow you to qualify for a home mortgage if you don\u2019t otherwise meet the income, asset and credit requirements of the loan program you are trying to apply for. Buyer assistance is intended to help otherwise eligible and qualified homebuyers with the upfront costs associated with buying a new home. Assistance comes in the form of a grant, that\u2019s not paid back, or more commonly, a \u201csilent second\u201d mortgage that has little or no interest rate, with no payments for the life of the first mortgage. That said, there is always a price, or cost associated with homebuyer assistance. \u00a0In most cases, you will pay more for your home mortgage if you use an assistance program, than if you did not use assistance. Government Says Assistance is Not Good? In the mortgage industry, there has been a lot of confusion, and discussion about a recent report published by the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. On July 9th, 2015, the OIG published an Audi Report on a company based in Arizona that does a high volume of homebuyer assistance programs. \u00a0To paraphrase, it cited higher closing costs, higher interest rates, and unnecessary risk associated with many assistance programs being offered by the mortgage lender. Shortly after this report came out, on July 20th, 2015, Ed Golding, Principal Deputy Assistance Secretary for Housing and Head of the FHA posted\u00a0this rebuttal: FROM THE DESK OF ED GOLDING July 20, 2015 RE: FHA\u2019s Position on Down Payment Assistance Programs In light of a recent audit by HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General, I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm FHA\u2019s support of certain down payment assistance programs, like those run by State Housing Finance Agencies. These programs help creditworthy families buy their first homes in communities across the country \u2013 responsibly expanding access to credit. The intent of our rules regarding down payment assistance is clear and allows HFAs the discretion necessary to fund these programs appropriately. HUD is taking active steps to completely resolve the issues raised in the audit and to provide proper clarity and guidance to the market. The High Cost of Homebuyer Assistance I don\u2019t want to dissuade you from using homebuyer assistance, without it, there are many families that could never overcome the upfront investment required to purchase their first home. \u00a0I\u2019m a huge advocate of homebuyer assistance programs, and I\u2019m an even greater advocate for transparency and consumer education. I am a lender in the State of California, and we have access to many great downpayment and closing cost assistance programs that are available throughout the entire State. Most all of these programs have fees and interest rates associated with them that are not charged if you do not use one of these assistance programs. Calculating the Cost of Assistance Here is an example how Buyer Assistance Programs cost more. Each week, Freddie Mac does a survey of the average interest rates being offered by lenders across the Country. \u00a0This survey is called the Primary Mortgage Market Survey, or PMMS. This is a snapshot of Thursday, August 6th survey of nationwide banks. \u00a0The average 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage rate is 3.91%, with .60% costs.\nLet\u2019s look at the same day\u2019s\u00a0interest rates on California\u2019s most common Homebuyer Assistance Programs. All of these programs require that you use\u00a0either a Conventional, or FHA, 3o year fixed first mortgage offered by the assistance provider. \u00a0Compare these rates to the Freddie Mac PMMS 30-Yr FRM. California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) CalPLUS FHA with ZIP & EXTRA \u2013 $4.125% CalPLUS Conventional with ZIP & EXTRA \u2013 4.625% Golden State Finance Authority (GSFA) GSFA Platinum Grant \u2013 Conventional \u2013 5.00% max grant GSFA Platinum Grant \u2013 FHA \u2013 4.5% National Homebuyer Fund (NHF) NHF Platinum Grant \u2013 Conventional \u2013 5.00% max grant NHF Platinum Grant \u2013 FHA \u2013 4.5% NHF Sapphire Grant \u2013 FHA \u2013 4.5% Southern California Housing Finance Authority (SCHFA) SCHFA Homebuyer Grant \u2013 FHA \u2013 4.375% In addition to slightly higher interest rates, all of these programs will also include an origination fee that is typically equal to 1.5% of the first loan amount. \u00a0Some programs will limit this to 1% of the loan amount, but that is rare. Looking at GSFA Platinum Grant, which offers a grant of up to 5% of the first loan amount, is automatically knocked down to 3.5% after you pay for the origination fee. CHDAP \u2013 Low Cost California Homebuyer Assistance Programs The State of California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) offers a \u201cstand alone\u201d buyer assistance program that is equal to 3% of the purchase price of your home. \u00a0This is the only assistance program available Statewide that allows you to use a first mortgage not required by the lender offering the assistance. This means that you could use a Conventional, or FHA, VA or USDA first mortgage program offered by any lender that is also approved\u00a0to offer assistance, at the most competitive interest that lender can provide. The California Homebuyer Downpayment Assistance Program, most commonly known as CHDAP, has a simple interest rate of 3.25%, and requires no payments for the life of the loan. If you are buying a home with a purchase price of $300,000, you have $9,000 that you can use toward the closing costs, or downpayment.\u00a0The CHDAP loan is required to be paid off if you sell, or refinance your home in the future. There are many options for covering your down payment and closing costs, and almost all options are worth the investment, just so that you can start enjoying the benefits of homeownership including preparing for retirement by building real estate equity over time, or tax deductions associated with homeownership. The best rule to follow when researching homebuyer assistance is to only use as much assistance as you absolutely need to purchase the home. \u00a0Trying to use assistance because you believe it to be free money could end up costing you thousands of dollars more than if you used no, or only as much assistance as you need. Other low cost assistance sources include using gift funds from a blood or marriage relative, loans from your 401K or retirement account, or employer sponsored assistance programs.
