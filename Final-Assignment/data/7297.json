Rak \n\nAs part of the pilot program, Saint Peter's University Hospital committed to immediately utilizing the five charging stations for staff members who own and drive electric vehicles to the hospital. In return, PSE&G provided the EV charging equipment free-of-charge and the hospital paid for the installation of the units and will pay for ongoing maintenance and electricity costs. \n\n\"The lack of convenient charging stations remains an impediment that keeps potential EV drivers from going all electric,\" said Joe Forline \n\nThe PSE&G pilot program currently has 25 EV charging stations in service at four customer locations around the state, including Saint Peter's University Hospital. There are 10 additional charging stations under construction at two other customer sites, and the utility is in discussion with several other customers with the goal of installing 50 individual charging stations at 10 customer locations by the end of 2015.\n\nIn addition to providing a convenient charging option for EV drivers, the PSE&G pilot program also allows the utility to collect real-world data about how the chargers are used. This will allow PSE&G to better understand the impact that large-scale EV charging could have on the electric grid, identify areas of potential high-EV charger density and plan for infrastructure upgrades and modifications that may be needed. \n\n\"By analyzing this data we will know how people and organizations use these charging systems in real life, which will allow us to better plan for the future of EVs in New Jersey \n\nThis is the third time that PSE&G and Saint Peter's Healthcare System have partnered to complete innovative energy-related projects.
