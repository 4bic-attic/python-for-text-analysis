By comparison, Lagunitas' barrel volumes jumped 50 percent in the same year. \n \nEarlier this year, California craft brewery Firestone Walker Brewing Company announced its merger with Flemish-family owned brewery Duvel Moortgat. \n \nPrivate equity firm Fireman Capital Partners purchased a majority stake in Oskar Blues Brewery, maker of Dale's Pale Ale, in May. \n \nLast year, Pabst Brewing company was acquired by Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings, a partnership between beer entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners. \n \nHeineken said Lagunitas will continue to be led by Tony Magee, its founder and executive chairman, and operate as an independent entity. \n \n(Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)", "source": "KFGO News"}
