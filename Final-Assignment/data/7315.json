The reality star, who suffered a mini stroke last week, has started an online petition to get back on Dancing with the Stars . Zolciak spent last week rehearsing in Atlanta with her pro partner Tony Dovolani , but was ultimately advised by her doctor not to fly and was therefore unable to compete. Host Tom Bergeron begrudgingly announced that the show's official rules state that any star who is unable to perform is automatically disqualified from the competition. Kim Zolciak forced to withdraw on Dancing with the Stars \"Sign This petition to bring @tonydovolani and me back,\" she posted on Instagram. \"I was cleared to dance on Friday when I was discharged from the hospital, so Saturday morning I was up rehearsing not even 12 hrs after. I had no restrictions BUT flying until today. Yes the timing sucked but ultimately my health is first. I wanted to dance here in ATL via satellite last night I can dance I just couldn't fly. I'm forever grateful for my dance partner @tonydovolani who has always supported me and All Of you my amazing fans!!!!!!!! Regardless I'll be dancing my ass off at the finale.\"  \nA photo posted by Kim Zolciak-Biermann (@kimzolciakbiermann) on Sep 29, 2015 at 5:25pm PDT \n As of this report, the petition has over 13,000 signatures, surpassing its 10,000 signature goal.
