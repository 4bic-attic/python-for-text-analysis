However, Brooklyn was not offered a scholarship to remain with the academy for this season with the Daily Mail saying that Arsenal youth coaches felt other players at his position (right midfield) \u201c are more advanced in their development \u201d at the same age. \n \nThe younger Beckham could almost certainly\u00a0find other opportunities to continue his football career, but that looks like it won\u2019t happen according to his father. \n \nDavid Beckham recently sat down with ABC \u201cNightline\u201d anchor Juju Chang and among the topics the pair discussed was Beckham\u2019s new role as \u201csoccer dad.\u201d Beckham says he does drop-offs and pick-ups but that one of his sons recently expressed that he no longer wanted to play. \n \n\u201cOne of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, \u2018daddy, I\u2019m not sure I want to play football all the time,\u2019\u201d Beckham told Chang. \u201cIt broke my heart a little bit. He said, \u2018every time I step on to the field, I know people are saying, \u2018this is David Beckham\u2019s son,\u2019 and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.\u2019\u201d \n \nThis was how Beckham re-enacted his reaction to hearing that news.\u00a0 \n \n\n \nBeckham, seemed to handle the news well, saying he told his son that he should only play if he wants to and if it makes him happy. \n \nYou can see the segment here via ABC News, with the \u201csoccer dad\u201d comments coming at the 1:38 mark. \n \n  \n\n \n\u00a0 \n  NOW WATCH: The most expensive and extravagant vacations in the world      \n \n   \n   \nRead more stories on Business Insider , Malaysian edition of the world\u2019s fastest-growing business and technology news website.", "source": "Business Insider Malaysia"}
