It\u2019s been nine years since I\u2019ve been to a Grand Final so it\u2019s very special,\u201d Park said. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a journey and a great ride but it\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d \n\n\nParker is one of five Brisbane players who share ten Grand Final appearances between them compared to three North Queensland players who share four. \n\n\nJohnathan Thurston is the best credentialled Cowboy in title deciders, winning with Canterbury in 2004 and losing with North Queensland in 2005, and although carrying an injury Parker said he\u2019ll be fully fit and focused as he chases the club\u2019s maiden premiership. \n\n\n\u201cI know the type of guy he is, I know the competitor he is and he understands his importance and he\u2019ll be kicking goals don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Parker said. \n\n\nWhile it\u2019s no secret that Thurston holds the key for the Cowboys, arguably the most important man for the Broncos won\u2019t even be on the field. \n \nNobody is more experienced or more successful on Grand Final Day than Wayne Bennett, the Supercoach now 80 minutes away from his eighth NRL premiership from nine attempts as a coach. \n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not too much more coaching you can do around this time of year,\u201d Parker said. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing it for 28 weeks of the year so I suppose it\u2019s just about getting each and every individual right where you need them to be to make sure on Sunday night you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d \n \nBoth teams like to play an expansive brand of football but Parker identified the battle up the middle of the field as the area he expects will decide the outcome. \n\n\nNorth Queensland assistant coach David Furner told Big Sports Breakfast that defence was the key to victory for the Cowboys but conceded their ability to handle the pressure of expectation in Townsville will also be crucial to their hopes of making history on Sunday. \n\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure there to deliver the first premiership but it\u2019s also exciting.\u201d Furner admitted.", "source": "Sportal.com.au"}
