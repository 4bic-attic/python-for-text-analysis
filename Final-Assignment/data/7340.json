Aadil has been fantastic for us this year and it's really good to see the young kids come through.\" \n\nCotton believes Derbyshire are still in with a good chance of finishing with a victory. \"The sun's been on the pitch for three days and it's starting to flatten out a little bit so once you get through the new ball there's not a great deal there although I thought we clawed it back in the last session. \n\n\"It's not one of those games that's just going to fizzle out and we are going to try tobe aggressive and take it all the way.\"", "source": "Burton Mail"}
