The problem is evident, nice apartments come with a higher rate, while cheaper ones are just not cozy. To cope with this challenge, the designers found a brand new and affordable way through renovating 48 student apartments located in an existing hotel. \n \n\n \nThe interior area of each room is approximately 27 square metres (290 square feet). The design removed an existing partition wall in between two rooms, and replaced it with a central high table as a common space for studying or socializing. \n \n\n \nIn this limited space, every single inch is fully used: the bed was designed to be raised and the study desk is placed under the bed, to make full use of space. Each bed, has a steel access ladder, blackout curtain for privacy, electrical wall sockets, and a reading light. \n \n\n \nWith the curtain shut, you have your own personal space, which also neatly incorporates a clothes rail, built-in shelves and lockable drawers, separate luggage space, along with a built-in desk sporting a multi-socket USB hub. Each apartment unit is also equipped with a bathroom, kitchen and other necessary daily facilities. \n \n\n \nVia Contemporist", "source": "Design You Trust. Design, Culture & Society."}
