As more and more polling rolls in showing Sanders matching or topping Clinton in both of the early-voting states \u2014 and Democratic power brokers are beginning to acknowledge that she could lose there \u2014 Clinton\u2019s campaign is coming under pressure to not just talk about taking the primary seriously but to start acting like it too. \nIn private conference calls and closed fundraisers, some donors are telling Clinton\u2019s brain trust something it certainly already knows: that Sanders\u2019 rally shows no signs of slowing. He\u2019s thrown some spiky roadblocks into what was once seen as her glide path to the nomination. And now it\u2019s time, they say, for a strategy shift. \n  POLITICO  \nI am seeing very little difference between Hillary 2008 and 2016, her campaign seems as dysfunctional, out of touch, and inept as ever. And if you don't think Team Hillary doesn't go negative on Bernie then your fooling yourself. This is the same candidate that dug up Reverend Wright and stirred the birther bullshit that permeates to this day.", "source": "Daily Kos"}
