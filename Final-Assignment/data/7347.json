UbiMeet provides the structure and support to help individuals develop good meeting habits, with an immediate added payback of time savings,\u201d said Andrea Hill, General Manager at UbiMeet. \u201cUbiMeet not only streamlines how to prepare for and run meetings, it ultimately serves as the go-to destination for all your daily meeting-related activities.\u201d \n    \nUbiMeet allows the user to complete all meeting preparation on the application including creating and distributing an agenda and highlighting the meeting objective.\u00a0 During the meeting, users can document decisions and action items in real time and UbiMeet will automate a post-meeting summary highlighting deliverables and next steps to send to meeting invitees. \n \nUbiMeet\u2019s daily morning recaps, delivered via email, make it easy for users to proactively plan their workday, prepare for upcoming meetings and complete outstanding to-dos. \n \n\u201cWe designed UbiMeet to empower individuals to take charge of their time and better manage activities outside of meetings,\" continued Hill. \"UbiMeet makes the time spent in the conference room more effective and less painful, and our early testers recognized the time-saving benefits of using UbiMeet right away.\u201d \n \nUbiMeet supports a user\u2019s existing workflow by syncing with Google Calendar and UbiMeet is currently developing integrations with common document management tools, including Google Drive, DropBox and Evernote.
