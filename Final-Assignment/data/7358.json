The flavor is quite different from the more traditional boiling and dry hopping of a brew.\u201d \n\nSprecher Brewing Company Founder Randy Sprecher will harvest the cones in a brief ceremony at the Show Dome display. From there, the hops will be taken directly to the Traveling Beer Garden where Sprecher will place the cones in the randall and tap the first beer.\u00a0 \n\nThe Traveling Beer Garden stop is located at Juneau Park, at the intersection of Kilbourn and Prospect avenues. Hours of the holiday weekend are Friday from 4-10 p.m.; and Saturday, Sunday, and Labor Day from 11 a.m.-10 p.m. The last beer is served at 9 p.m. Labor Day is the last day of the Traveling Beer Garden.\u00a0", "source": "CBS 58"}
