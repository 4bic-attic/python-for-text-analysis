This cooking competition and seminar attracted the enthused participation of their students, particularly those from the College of Hospitality and Institutional Management (CHIM). COOK Magazine\u2019s Editor In Chief, Chef Dino Datu\nduring the cooking demo \u201cStudent chefs can provide us new exciting recipes for our products as well as possible new sauces which they can formulate using their own creativity and knowledge they got from the school and their other experiences,\u201d explains Gabriel A. Reyes, Assistant General Manager of HDR Foods Corporations, the company that produces the Mother\u2019s Best Brand. The college boasts of comprehensive programs in all related disciplines, and Mr. Reynaldo H. Carandang Jr., program head of CHIM agrees that participation by culinary students hones their skills and creativity and brings them great excitement as well: \u201cStudent\u2019s exposure to various culinary contests allows them to enhance their confidence and be more competent in their field of expertise. They are also made abreast of culinary trends and innovations. The exposure provides an opportunity for them to interact with industry practitioners providing them tips and advice in getting first hand information from the experts.\u201d This event is something that Mother\u2019s Best intends to be just the first of many because investing in the youth is something they believe in. \u201cIt is important to work with them and build the relationship with them while they are young,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cThese young chefs will be the future driving force of our restaurants industry as well as the future chefs of their respective home kitchen, and we want them to patronize Mother\u2019s Best both in their future careers and at home.\u201d COOK Magazine\u2019s Editor In Chief, Chef Dino Datu along with Chef Winston Jerome C. Luna, Caterer and Event Specialist, shared their culinary expertise by demonstrating their own version of Asian Fusion Dishes as well as giving students valuable tips and advice about the industry.\u00a0 Chef Dino Datu whipped up Black Pepper Crab, Singapore Chili Prawns, and Easy Claypot Rice, which are just some of the most popular recipes that the COOK Magazine test kitchen has featured specifically using Mother\u2019s Best products.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chef Winston, who owns Chefwix Catering, not only showed kitchen expertise by cooking Oriental Wings with Chinese Greens, he also held an engaging seminar on what it takes to be a success in food related ventures.\u00a0\u00a0 In the culinary competition, the students worked with stoves provided by Fujidenzo, while the cooking implements were supplied by Masflex.\u00a0 The student chefs were grouped into five teams, with two students per team, and they cooked with Mother\u2019s Best Hot Sauce, Mother\u2019s Best Oyster Sauce, and the Mother\u2019s Best Barbecue Marinade, which are the items the company is most known for.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor now we want to focus on our core products, since we want to build on and strengthen the loyalty, acceptance and the market for these items,\u201d Gabby emphasizes. \u201cBut of course we would still want others to try our new products and we are continuously developing new ones to provide instant kitchen solutions for our cooks and chefs.\u201d\u00a0 Contestants: Team #1: CURT AUSTIN CASTRO / JOSHUA CUYUGAN
