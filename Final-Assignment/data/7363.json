Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nWas he taking his\u00a044 votes and trying to form government with the Nationals and the Greens?\u00a0 \n \nOr perhaps\u00a0hatching a plot to go to the Governor-General and call a double-dissolution election before Malcolm Turnbull could get there?\u00a0 \n\nDid he have a\u00a0gnarly hangover? Had he fled the country? Was he refusing to get out of bed?\u00a0 \n \nMr Abbott's entire office turned out for his speech. Photo: Alex Ellinghauasen  \n  \nCome midday, his office soothed\u00a0the fever with\u00a0a final press conference alert. \n\n\"The Prime Minister is in Canberra and has the following media engagement,\" it blandly said.\u00a0\"12.30pm press statement.\"\u00a0 \n\nThe stage in the PM's\u00a0courtyard was stripped right back. Just two flags adorned the lectern\u00a0that had previously enjoyed a beefy posse of 10.\u00a0 \n \nA helicopter hovering overhead made the ousted  PM almost impossible to hear.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \n\"There will be no wrecking, no undermining and no sniping,\" he began. \"Our country deserves better than that.\"\u00a0 \n\nBut as he started to run through his achievements \u2014\u00a0\"300,000 more people are in jobs,\u00a0Labor's bad taxes are gone\" \u2014\u00a0the audience leaned in, ear drums first.\u00a0 \n\nA helicopter\u00a0(for Channel Seven, not Bronwyn Bishop)\u00a0hovering above Parliament House was making the Prime Minister almost impossible to hear.\u00a0 \n\nThrough the whir and hum of the blades, only the odd phrase could be deciphered. \n\n\"We stayed focused despite the\u00a0white-anting ... \" \n\n\"We have been a government of men and women, not a government of gods ...\"\u00a0 \n\nThings seemed to get even noisier\u00a0just as Abbott\u00a0imparted some\u00a0unsolicited advice to the press. \n\n\"Refuse \u00a0... print ... claims ... won't put his ... name to.\u00a0 \n\n\"Refuse to\u00a0connive at dishonour by acting as the assassin's knife,\" Abbott pleaded \n\n\"Assassin's what?\" a senior correspondent whispered back.\u00a0 \n\nIn just\u00a0five minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0without mentioning Turnbull, let alone congratulating him\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Australia's 28th prime minister\u00a0exited the courtyard.\u00a0 \n\nHe didn't take questions.
