Chinese troops held down the majority of the well-armed Japanese. \n \nAround 260 million Chinese were involved in the war and more than 35 million people killed or wounded. \n \nHowever, \u201cmost Westerners don\u2019t know very much about China\u2019s experiences in World War II and they are often surprised\u201d to hear these numbers, the scholar said. \n \nIf China had opted out of the war in 1938, one of the worst years of the war, the historian said, both the course and the outcome of the war would have been different. \n \n\u201cJapan\u2019s forces would also have been freed for an all-out assault on the USSR, Southeast Asia, or even British India,\u201d he said. \n Related Posts", "source": "Mangalorean"}
