I was impressed to see the immediate effect of PiCSO, as my patients did not experience chest pain, nor did we see ECG changes or signs of no-reflow phenomena, which can normally be expected during such procedures,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis demonstrates the positive effects of PiCSO on myocardial perfusion. I now look forward to making this therapy available for our acute myocardial infarction patients at Al Qassimi Hospital.\u201d \n\nThe procedures in the UAE were performed with the support of Access Medical LLC., a UAE-based medical devices distributor and sister company of Medical Technology Est., which is now co-operating with Miracor to launch the PiCSOAMI Impulse System also in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman. \n\n\u201cThe launch of PiCSO in Asia marks an important milestone in the ongoing commercialization of PiCSO worldwide,\u201d says Lars Schiemanck, Managing Director of Miracor. \u201cIntegrating PiCSO therapy into regular PCI procedures without interrupting the workflow of the cath lab was made possible by the introduction of Miracor\u2019s second generation device in 2014. This has been demonstrated in clinical use in Europe and greatly expands the potential use of PiCSO therapy. Our goal is to make this innovative therapy available to acute myocardial infarction patients worldwide.\u201d \n\nLearn more about PiCSO at www.miracormedical.com \n\nAbout Miracor Medical Systems GmbH Miracor Medical Systems GmbH (www.miracormedical.com) is an Austrian medical device company developing innovative solutions to treat severe heart diseases; striving to bring back cardiac patients to normal life. Miracor develops and commercializes the PiCSO\u00ae (Pressure-controlled Intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion) Impulse System, a technology platform designed to improve clinical outcome of patients with impaired cardiac function. \n\nThe Miracor PiCSOAMI (Pressure-controlled Intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion) Impulse System is designed to treat acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (\u2018STEMI\u2019) patients and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (\u2018NSTEMI\u2019) patients by improving myocardial perfusion in complement with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PiCSOAMI is applied during PCI and designed to intermittently block the coronary sinus, a large vessel that collects blood from the heart muscle (myocardium), thereby increasing perfusion of the myocardium and reducing injury resulting from myocardial infarction. \n\nAbout Medical Technology Est.
