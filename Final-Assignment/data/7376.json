Pero \u2018yong support kasi ng mga fans, listeners and sumusuporta sa show namin sobrang passionate nila.\u201d\n\nThis is the reason why she considers this concert as a \u201cgift\u201d for her fans that tirelessly support her in every project she does.\n\nShe also sees this as a way of connecting to her fans saying, \u201cmagtatapos ang taon na \u2018to na nakapag-share ako ng something very personal sa mga fans. Natutuwa ako na through my music nase-share ko \u2018yong personal life ko other than some other things.\u201d\n\nBefore the series of projects came to her this year, Glaiza admitted she had doubts about her skills as an actress and musician.\n\nWhen her TV series with Rhian Ramos came, alongside her album \u201cSynthesis,\u201d the Kapuso actress-singer slowly gained confidence.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to recognize my music, pero siyempre nando'n pa rin 'yong at the back of my mind na 'until when ito? What's the next step? What if I fail?'\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPero tina-try ko na mag-focus sa positive side and just enjoy. Kasi on the first place 'yon naman talaga ang gusto kong gawin, e, to just play,\u201d she added.\n\nNow that she\u2019s still waiting for her next project, Glaiza wants to focus first on pushing her music career, especially after she felt she has neglected it for a while.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really pushing my album since I don\u2019t know when. So gano\u2019n din ako ka-passionate sa album ko na \u2018to and sa concert na \u2018to,\u201d she said. \u201cKasi matagal na siyang andyan lang. So given the opportunity na I don\u2019t have a show yet sa TV, talagang pagtutuunan ko siya ng pansin ngayon.\u201d\n\nThe special guests at Glaiza\u2019s \u201cDreams Never End\u201d concert are Jay-R, Aiza Seguerra, Rhian Ramos and Regine Velasquez-Alcasid.", "source": "Philippine Star"}
