But don\u2019t worry folks, it doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t be seeing her on the show again in the future. \n\n\u2018Simon and Sinitta haven\u2019t fallen out,\u2019 a source told the Radio Times. \u2018They\u2019re just trying something different this year.\u2019 \n\n\u2018As part of it\u2019s live, it\u2019s a case of timings,\u2019 the insider added. \u2018We\u2019re only going to see the contestants\u2019 performances on location, as those decisions are being made back at Wembley. \n\n\u2018So there\u2019s no time for all of those different critiques.\u2019 \n\nSinitta has been a regular fixture at judges\u2019 houses in the past, even going so far as to join Louis Walsh when Simon Cowell was not a judge. \n\nThis year will see Simon take his Overs hopefuls to France, while Rita Ora and the girls will head for Los Angeles. \n\nMeanwhile Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is taking the groups to Rome \u2013 while Nick Grimshaw\u2019s boys category may have\u00a0to content themselves with a trip to Greater Manchester, in order to fit around his radio commitments.", "source": "Metro.co.uk"}
