(Think of old atomic test footage where the trees first bend away from the blast before bending back towards it in a rush of dust & debris.) Supposedly if you\u2019re standing close enough to this (but not so close as to be incinerated,) it can pull your lungs and stuff out of your mouth. \n \nMaybe keeping one\u2019s mouth closed could keep all the inside things inside, but this all sounds sketchy to begin with, like something the kid who always wore camo at summer camp would come up with.", "source": "Comments for Rock, Paper, Shotgun - PC Game Reviews, Previews, Subjectivity"}
