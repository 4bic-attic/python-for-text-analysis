As a result, the parts of the ELIS system that were already released have to be rebuilt.\u201d \n \nUSCIS awarded new contracts, but didn\u2019t update cost estimates, the schedule or ELIS\u2019s expected capabilities, \u201ceven though it was clear that its initial plan no longer worked,\u201d the post said. GAO estimated that the changes caused more delays and added another $1 billion to the project\u2019s cost. \n \nUSCIS announced in May that ELIS wouldn\u2019t be completed until March 2019 for $3.1 billion, but the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 USCIS\u2019 parent agency \u2013 \u201cdisagreed that changes to the acquisition strategy delayed the program and added $1 billion to the overall cost,\u201d the May report said. \n \n\u201cWe will continue to examine the transformation program and its implementation to help ensure that USCIS\u2019s modernized immigration system is better than what came before,\u201d the post said. \n \nFollow Ethan on Twitter \n \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
