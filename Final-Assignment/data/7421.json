I\u2019m happy that he has, of course, as it was a nothing flick of the foot and was clearly provoked by someone with the Corinthian spirit of a piranha. But I\u2019m not quite sure how Arsenal \u2018proved\u2019 that Gabriel didn\u2019t touch Costa (as I have read elsewhere), and even if that were true, does that mean intent is no longer a factor? It appears that Arsenal have tested the latest rules whereby the FA permits clubs to appeal \u201cthe legitimacy of the dismissal itself and against the severity of the three-game punishment\u201d. I think it\u2019s a common-sense result, which is the last thing I expected from the FA, but I\u2019m not sure how the process now works if I\u2019m honest. Nevertheless, combined with a deserved ban for Costa, it\u2019s bound to raise Mourinho\u2019s hackles. Whether the whole unseemly affair ends up motivating Chelsea, or giving us the shot in the arm we need, only time will tell but I have my own suspicions it might benefit them more than us, beyond the obvious three points. You can be sure Mourinho will try to engender a siege mentality. I wouldn\u2019t really blame him \u2013 it can work. Just ask George Graham. And Jose Mourinho. Tonight, we\u2019re back in the saddle after two straight defeats, both of which will have been more mentally than physically sapping. The Zagreb one because we were complacent and predictable, the Chelsea one because yet again we lost to them in the league and our pitiful league record continues. I\u2019m torn about the line-up. On the one hand beating Spurs should always be a priority, and our form needs reversing pronto, so we should play our strongest side. But on the other hand, I think Debuchy and Gibbs \u2013 to take two examples \u2013 would benefit from another game now, and will almost certainly be better for a second game in a week. No reason why that extra rotation couldn\u2019t come round on Saturday rather than tonight, but it doesn\u2019t seem very Wenger to do it that way. Certainly, we can\u2019t let two defeats become three, then become four. So if we\u2019re still stewing in our frustration, Gabriel\u2019s un-ban hasn\u2019t made a difference to the mood, and the thought of a derby hasn\u2019t got the juices flowing, then we need our heads looking at. We\u2019ll find out more tonight\u2026 (And for the eagle-eyed, stalwart few, yes, this site looks different. It\u2019s a long story and I need to fix it all again. Joy, oh joy.)
