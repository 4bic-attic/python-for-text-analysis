He made this latest statement in an email sent out to supporters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"Tonight, Republicans will hold their second presidential primary debate. And just like last time, we can expect each candidate to go heavy on extreme rhetoric and light on real solutions,\" the president of the United States writes. \"Unfortunately, the situation on Capitol Hill isn't any better.\" Of course Obama is asking for money for the Democratic organization. \"Congress has just 15 days to keep the federal government open, but instead of getting serious, GOP senators are plotting more votes to curtail a woman's right to choose. They might even force another government shutdown -- just like in 2013 -- unless we defund Planned Parenthood! \"It doesn't have to be this way, Daniel. We can break this cycle and bring serious, Democratic leadership back to the Senate -- but we must act now. \"The DSCC is fighting to elect Democrats who will do just that, and they're only $50,000 short of their mid-month goal. Can I count on you to pitch in and close that gap? \"It\u2019s clear Senate Republicans would rather please their base than do their jobs, even if it means putting millions of working families at risk. We can\u2019t let them get away with it -- and we won\u2019t, with your help. \"So Daniel, if you're tired of seeing Republicans hijack our economy, will you join me and help the DSCC hold them accountable?\"", "source": "The latest from The Weekly Standard by Daniel Halper"}
