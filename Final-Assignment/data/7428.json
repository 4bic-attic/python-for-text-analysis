Their postseason hopes are dwindling by the day, and unless they go on a hot streak soon they may very well find themselves missing out on the playoffs a season after winning 98 games and running away with the AL West. \n\nWhen asked about the team's current struggles by MLB.com's Alden Gonzalez, shortstop Erick Aybar responded with the following in Spanish: \"Baseball's tough, man. You want to do things right to win the game, but nothing is going our way right now. Everything we do is bad. Everything.\" \n\nOutfielder Kole Calhoun, who actually fared quite well against both Dodger aces Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw (homering against both), summed up the Halos' issues by echoing Aybar's sentiment: \"It's tough, man. We want to win every game right now. We're in the chase, and all these games are big games, every single one of them going forward.\" \n\nTime is of the essence, especially if the Angels want to continue playing baseball in early October. \n\n(h/t MLB.com)", "source": "DailyNews724.com"}
