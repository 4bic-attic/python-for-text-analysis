A guitarist wanted to fight a drummer ... and the drummer wouldn't do it? \n\nCarney tweeted that White saw him Sunday night at a New York City bar and the two got into a confrontation. \n\n\"I've never met Jack White until last night,\" Carney wrote, according to Alternative Press. \"He came to a bar in NYC I go to a lot with a few friends and tried to fight me. I don't fight and don't get fighting but he was mad!!!\" \n\nSo don't fight him. But at least be a drummer about it. Pick him up, dump him in a garbage can, and get back to your drink. \n\nCarney also wrote, \"He is why I play music. The bully (expletives) who made me feel like nothing. Music was a private, non-competitive thing. A 40-year-old bully tried to fight the 35-year-old nerd. Jack White is basically Billy Corgan's dumb-ass Zero t-shirt in human form.\" \n\nMusic is non-competitive ... a drummer taking crap from a guitarist ... what planet does this guy play on? \n\nThe former White Stripes frontman later released a statement to Entertainment Weekly, saying, \"Nobody tried to fight you, Patrick. Nobody touched you or 'bullied' you. You were asked a question you couldn't answer so you walked away. So quit whining to the Internet and speak face to face like a human being. End of story.\" \n\n\nRight. Jack White told Patrick Carney to quit whining and speak face-to-face ... through a statement released to a magazine with a website. \n\nCarney later tweeted, \"Talked to Jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\" \n\nThanks goodness. \n\nTony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group. Contact him at", "source": "Fort Morgan Times"}
