He went 5.2 innings allowing just one run on six hits and a pair of walks while striking out six. Kelly's record improved to 10-6.\nThe Red Sox jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the bottom of the third inning on an umpire-reviewed solo home run by Mookie Betts, his 14th of the season.\nDavid Ortiz (pictured) followed three batters later with a three-run blast to straightaway centerfield. It was his 32nd of the season and career home run number 498 as the march to 500 continues.\nThe playoffs, while still mathematically possible, are out of the picture but a .500 record isn't, nor is third place in the American League Easter Division.
