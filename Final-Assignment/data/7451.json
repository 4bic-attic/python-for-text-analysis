This did not bother me as I never water my lawn anyway. \n \n\r\n\tThen came the most nefarious of all: the Blue Lid Rummager. \n \n\r\n\tThe garbage truck driver is now conducting arbitrary blue lid searches. Even the most conscientious of citizens can be targeted and served a notice. Reason for notices: the vagueness of the guidelines. Questions posed by the homeowner to the garbage driver are often answered vaguely or they are instructed to look for answers online. Odd as it may sound, a lot of households do not have computers. \n \n\r\n\tAlthough a sticker has been provided on some blue lid bins, it does not provide sufficient information to guide taxpayers as to the correct disposal for the 50 shades of grey items we all put in the blue waste thinking they are OK. Homeowners require more adequate direction. \n \n\r\n\tSpecific information is needed, otherwise the black lid will be the alternative choice for items that more properly should be disposed of elsewhere. \n \n\r\n\tIan MacSween, \n\r\n\tPort Coquitlam \n \n\u00a9", "source": "The Tri-City News"}
