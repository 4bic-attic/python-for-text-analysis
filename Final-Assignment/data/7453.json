I have a whopping 14\u2026Good for you lovely!!! I have been following your blog for awhile and I always felt so sad whenever you talked about your time at your retail job. \nI am actually still in retail. I am working for a different company working in a print shop. I really like working in a print shop. So I am excited. I would really like to work for a small print shop, but all the local print shops in my area are not hiring. I really like running jobs and playing around with the copiers/printers/finishing machines. I\u2019m glad I still get to do that. My problem wasn\u2019t I hate what I do, I hate the company I worked for.\u00a0", "source": "Disney with a splash of Feminism!"}
