How much more you can earn will depend on both your undergraduate degree and the graduate degree you\u2019d pursue.

Most of these are just as you would expect. If you have a degree in the humanities, getting an MA or MS in Humanities would boost your lifetime income 8.4%\u2014a difference of $223,660 over your lifetime\u2014compared to an increase of 175.7% if you went to dental school, a difference of $7,101,330. Granted, dental school takes longer and is more expensive. SoFi\u2019s calculations also take into account income lost while you\u2019re in school and student loan costs. The good news is that in all but four combinations, a graduate degree leads to higher median lifetime earnings. The exceptions, as Quartz reports: The glaring exception: People who got a bachelor\u2019s in engineering, business, finance, or economics, and then pursued a graduate degree in fine arts, humanities, or social sciences. For instance, SoFi found that someone who got a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering saw their median lifetime earnings drop by 17% after getting a Master\u2019s in fine arts. Sorry, MFA grads, but good news MBA students: No matter what your undergraduate major, an MBA boosts median lifetime earnings between 34% and 89%. If the data here doesn\u2019t help you decide, you can calculate whether grad school is worth it for your particular situation and use the one-year salary rule of thumb to decide if getting a student loan for that degree will pay off. Should you go to graduate school? Yes. Maybe. Definitely not | Quartz", "source": "Lifehacker"}
