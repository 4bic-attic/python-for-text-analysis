Instead, the team's research, specifically on two Volkswagen cars, \"brought this global company to its knees,\" reports\u00a0 NPR . \n \nThe team led by Dan Carder of the Center for Alternative Fuels Engines and Emissions just didn't see the low emissions promised while testing a Jetta and Passat with an elaborate device that funneled exhaust into measurement systems ( seen here ), though emissions from a BMW X5 were at or below certification emission levels. The numbers \"were higher than we anticipated,\" Carder tells the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal . \"There was one vehicle with 15 to 35 times the emissions levels and another vehicle with 10 to 20 times the emissions levels,\" he adds, per\u00a0 Reuters . \n \nRead the full story on Newser.com \n \nPHOTO", "source": "KSSN"}
