Obviously. We have talked about it for some period of time.\" \n\n\u201cBut the other part of the equation is Assad and how you resolve the fact that he is a magnet for foreign fighters to come to the region.\u201d \n\nRussia has been building military support for Assad over recent weeks and the U.S. has claimed it is constructing an air base near Latakia, a stronghold for Assad forces in the civil war that has been raging for more than four years. \n\nHammond said after the meeting that the U.K. was keeping the possibility of fresh military action in Syria under constant review. \n\nHe said: \u201cBecause of the Russian engagement, the situation in Syria is becoming more complicated. I think we need to discuss this as part of a much bigger problem, the migration pressures, the humanitarian crisis in Syria as well as the need to defeat ISIL.\u201d \n\nKerry, who is on a tour of Europe focused on Syria, said the \u201croot cause\u201d of the migration crisis in Europe was the war in Syria. \n\nThe U.K. government is expected to table a parliamentary vote on authorizing airstrikes on Daesh targets in Syria in the coming weeks. \n\nHammond added the U.K. and U.S. were \u201ccompletely aligned\u201d on Assad\u2019s departure as part of any solution in Syria but that the timetable needed further discussion.", "source": "Mideaster News"}
