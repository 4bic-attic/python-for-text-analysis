Each woman is different and it\u2019s important to be yourself in the process. It\u2019s not all about buying a new Lilly Pulitzer dress; you can wear your Birkenstocks and flannel, just be yourself.\u201d \n \nJunior David Waller, vice president of programming and recruitment for the interfraternity council, said that everyone should \u201cdress casually\u201d for recruitment events. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t try too hard to impress current fraternity men,\u201d Waller said. \u201cWe just want originality, creativity and a passion for getting involved. A fraternity man is someone who wants to give back to the community, so we recruit people who are going to do that,\u201d he said. \n \nGo into it with an open mind \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to go into recruitment thinking you know exactly which [chapter] you want to be in,\u201d Schratz said. \u201cGo into recruitment with excitement for the opportunity of making new connections.\u201d \n \nBoth Williams and Schratz said they agree that being personable and making true connections is how you\u2019ll get the best out of the recruitment experience. \u201cWhen you share values, that\u2019s where the magic happens,\u201d Williams said. \n \nGo to events \n \nEach of the events that are put on are a great way to get to know the chapters individually.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cRecruitment events give potential new members an opportunity to see what our values and membership are like,\u201d Waller said. \n \nEven if you are not sure you want to commit to a fraternity or sorority, you can check out the events and get a feel for the environment and the people involved. \n \n\u201cRecruitment should be a low-pressure way for interested people to get to know every fraternity chapter at UVM, and then the decision to join is solely theirs,\u201d Waller said. \n \nSelf-care \n \nRecruitment can be time consuming. \n \n\u201cKeep in mind that it\u2019s a busy four days, but an exciting four days,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMake sure you do all your homework before and make sure you take care of yourself more than anything else.\u201d \n \nWilliams said that students should feel both healthy and happy as they go into recruitment. \n \nEveryone is welcome \n \nGreek life can be a way for first-years to get involved in the community and make connections. But one myth about recruitment is that only first years can rush. \n \n\u201cWe really want to invite everyone to recruitment,\u201d Williams said. \n \nJunior Cheyenne Mobbs said she decided to go through recruitment after being an orientation leader this past summer. \n \n\u201cI am really interested in having another community in my life, as well as more opportunities to get involved, both on and off campus,\u201d she said. \n Share this:  \n Related", "source": "Vermont Cynic"}
