The score was locked at two sets apiece \u2013 4-6, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 \u2013 when the 19-year-old was forced to call it a day after dropping serve to trail 2-0 in the deciding set. \n\nAfter seizing a two-sets-to-one lead over the French 12th seed, Kokkinakis dropped eight straight points after serving at 2-2 and 30-love in the fourth set. He winced in pain as he was treated courtside and could barely move as the punishing heat \u2013 which hit 32C \u2013 and humidity took hold. \n\nKokkinakis rolled serves into play at less than 100km/hr before being reduced to under-arm serving at one point. The South Australian looked to the heavens and despairingly told the tennis gods: \u201cIt\u2019s absolute torture\u201d before finally stopping after advice from the chair umpire to consider his health. \n\nRelated: Sam Groth lifts Australian gloom after poor start on opening day of US Open \n\nShattered by his unfortunate demise, the teenager smashed his racquet into the cement before staggering to the net to shake hands with Gasquet. \n\nKokkinakis\u2019s sorry departure continues Australia\u2019s disappointing start to the s\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
