During their last TV run in the classic series The Muppet Show they cranked out 5 seasons and 120 episodes. Since they shifted more focus to the big screen before kind of disappearing for some time. Thankfully they were revived once again with the big screen feature The Muppets and the follow of Muppets Most Wanted. Now they are returning to where they belong with an all new prime time series aptly titled The Muppets. \n\nThe new series features the gang in a contemporary, documentary-style show that will explore the Muppets\u2019 personal lives and relationships, both at home and at work, as well as romances, breakups, achievements, disappointments, wants and desires all during the production of Up Late with Miss Piggy, a fictional late-night talk show, starring Miss Piggy and airing on the ABC network after Jimmy Kimmel Live!. All of your favorites will be there including Kermit\u2019s new girlfriend Denise that has been making headlines ever since the shocking break-up of Piggy and Kermit. \n \nThe show looks to keep the formula of bringing on guest celebrities with the talk show format giving it a bit of familiarity, but be warned as some critics have already pointed out that this is not a kids show and will take on more adult themes at times, so some might not want their kids watching. Either way it feels right to have them back on TV where they belong and will hopefully be the start to another long run for Henson\u2019s iconic characters. \n \nBe there when they light the lights once again when The Muppets premieres on September 22nd on ABC. \n \nFor more information head over to http://abc.go.com/shows/the-muppets/", "source": "Examiner.com"}
