In both the 1934 and \u201935 Fall Classics, he recorded a .375 average or better and amassed an on-base plus slugging mark north of .900. \n \nGehringer\u2019s production at the plate helped the club win in \u201935 against the Cubbies. \n \nHe reached the Fall Classic once more in his 16 seasons of playing in 100-plus games in Motown. \n \nHis final Series appearance came in 1940, and he didn\u2019t impress nearly as much, recording a lowly .214 BA to go along with a dismal OPS south of .500, which is not even a decent mark for a major league backup. \n \nHowever, with all that said, \u201cThe Mechanical Man\u201d finished with a very impressive .321 average in 20 WS games. \n \nAnd then, there were two. These two men came up through the Tigers\u2019 farm system together, and then made their major league debuts on the same day: September 9, 1977. \n \nI\u2019m talking about \u201cTram\u201d and Whitaker, who played from 1977-95 with one another on the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. \n \n\u201cTram\u201d and \u201cSweet Lou\u201d were members of arguably the greatest championship team in franchise history, the 1984 \u201cBless You Boys,\u201d who started off 35-5 and went on to lose a lone game in the playoffs. \n \nThey were the best team from start to finish in \u201984, and Trammell had a lot to do with why the club was able to finish off the San Diego Padres in five games in the \u201984 Fall Classic. \n \nIn capturing Most Valuable Player honors, Trammell hit .450 and recorded an OPS above 1,000. He also hit two big flies and drove in six. \n \nNot to mention, he hit above .350 and recorded an OPS yet again above 1,000 in the \u201984 ALCS against the Kansas City Royals. \n \nThe Tigers made the playoffs one other time in his career: in 1987. \n \nIt was a far from memorable series for \u201cTram,\u201d as he struggled at the plate and posted a lowly .200 BA and an OPS below .500. \n \nHis lowly postseason performance in \u201987, however, still left the longtime Detroit shortstop with a career .333 average and a career OPS mark of .992 in 13 postseason games. \n \nTrammell\u2019s double-play partner in Whitaker did not garner nearly as much success at the plate as his counterpart did in the \u201984 postseason. \n \nWhitaker hit below the \u201cMendoza Line,\u201d which is when a batter records a BA below .200, during the club\u2019s three-game sweep of the Royals in the ALCS. \n \nHe did, however, then post a more than respectable .278 average and .798 OPS against the Padres. \n \nBut he never posted an average which eclipsed the .200 threshold again in his postseason career, which consisted of 13 games. \n \nWith that being said, his career playoff batting average of .204 left a lot to be desired for many Tigers fans, and it\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m eliminating him from contention in the race for the greatest position player in franchise history. \n \nAs my last measuring tool, I\u2019m going to look at the career on-base plus slugging marks of Cobb, Kaline, Gehringer and Trammell. \n \nThe only three players in franchise history to record an OPS of .950 or above are current Hall of Famer \u201cHammerin\u2019 Hank\u201d Greenberg, fellow first baseman and current Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera plus the one and only Cobb. \n \nWith the lead in two of the three necessary categories, Cobb easily ranks as the top Tigers position player of all-time in my book. \n \nNow, on to a harder decision to make: my choice of who is the second best all-time Detroit position player. \n \nGehringer and Kaline are the only two Tigers hitters remaining on my list who amassed a career OPS north of .850. Thus, they are the only two worthy of being selected as the second greatest position player in franchise history, leaving Trammell as the fourth best. \n \nFor me, because of the fact that Gehringer (.884 career OPS) and Kaline (.855 career OPS) are separated from one another in OPS by less than 30 points, it comes down to playoff success in deciding between the two. \n \nIt\u2019s where Kaline reigns supreme when evaluating the two head-to-head. \n \nKaline\u2019s two home runs and eight RBIs in the \u201968 Series are more than what Gehringer accumulated in both categories in three trips to the Fall Classic, which is why Kaline gets the nod over Gehringer as the club\u2019s no. 2 best position player of all-time. \n \nThe trio of Cobb, Kaline and Gehringer are in a class of their own, forming the top tier of Tigers position player greats, while Trammell and Whitaker form the second tier. \n \nThose five players comprise an exclusive club that Cabrera, a two-time American League MVP, is on the verge of cracking. \n \nCabby\u2019s been worth 4.9 WAR so far this season, and produced five WAR in 2014. \n \nIf he puts up similar WAR numbers over the course of the next four to five seasons, he\u2019ll easily join the second tier of Motown position player greats. \n \nCabrera, Trammell and Whitaker. Imagine if that trio \u2014 in its prime \u2014 was able to form the core of the Tigers infield.", "source": "Detroit Athletic Co. Blog"}
