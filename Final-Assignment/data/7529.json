After he scored again to put the Hawks (2-0) up 12-0, a Bloomingdale player's ejection led to Armwood kicking off from the 50. Inexplicably, no Bull fielded the short kickoff and Armwood recovered on the 8-yard line. Snead scored on the next play, his second touchdown in 21 seconds, to put Armwood up 18-0. \n\nStars of the game: Snead scored all three of his touchdowns in the first half and finished with 96 yards on nine carries. Armwood's defense was dominant as usual. Clint Polk notched a sack and returned quarterback Isaiah McIntyre's fumble 81 yards on a fourth-down play. Kyheem Campbell, Caleb Sutherland, and Dedarallo Blue also contributed sacks. C.J. Jones scooped a fumble and scored a touchdown on an ill-advised halfback throwback play. Armwood backup quarterback Warren Thompson scored on a 34-yard run and passed for a touchdown. For Bloomingdale, McIntyre threw for 137 yards and a touchdown to Patrick Weidrich and Xavier Hernandez grabbed an interception. \n\nStats of the g\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
