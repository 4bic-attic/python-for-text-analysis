I'm not surprised about what I can do. I knew I could do things like this.\" \n\nHe admitted it will be tougher to maintain his form now that opposition defences have become aware of the danger he poses, suggesting they may start to foul him if they can't tackle him legally. \n\n\"It is more difficult for me now that they know me - they will close a lot. So I have to be careful now, they will start to kick me, the manager said to me as well,\" he concluded. \n\nThe Foxes face the biggest challenge to their unbeaten start to the season this weekend when they welcome Arsenal to the King Power Stadium on Saturday. \n\n  \nPosted: 2015-09-25 11", "source": "Football365.co.za"}
