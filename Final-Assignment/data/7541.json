He was also involved with Cleveland Public Theatre and the Gordon Square Arts District. \n\u201cI think Lorain is an arts town,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the Gordon Square Arts District, where you have a theater, which is really the center or the hub of what I think as the economic renaissance.\u201d \nJoan Perch, FireFish arts founder and Lorain County Community College\u2019s Stocker Arts Center gallery coordinator, agreed. \n\u201cLots of great festivals have been energizing Lorain. Rockin\u2019 on the River brought great entertainment every weekend to Lorain. Light Up Lorain is transforming into Waterfront WinterFest and the International Festival is an anchor,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe hope the FireFish Festival keeps growing and can become the signature, unique arts and fire festival that will help brand us a place where festivals, creativity, artists, risk-taking and entrepreneurs are welcome. That is a game changer for a city and region.\u201d \nThe all-day affair celebrates Lorain\u2019s classic architecture and industrial heritage with an array of performances \u2014 local artists, world musicians, inventive visual art installations and fire performers \u2014 to be found in the unlikeliest of places. \nThis includes the Broadway main stage featuring Lorain\u2019s Pepe Rivera Ensemble, Sacred Heart Church gospel singers and rock act Johnny La Rock & Furface, while alleyways and courtyards boast Cleveland\u2019s Great Lakes Light Opera, cello-flute duo Intuitive and magician Rick Smith Jr. \nThen there\u2019s the grand finale, which is billed as the FireFish Processional Fire Event, featuring ballet dancers, belly dancers, performing artists, drummers, stilt walkers, musicians and a chorale group. \nLevin hopes for 2,000 visitors; however, he points out other festivals he\u2019s piloted in Cleveland have attracted 10,000 people. That said, it appears as though the FireFish Festival will become an annual event for downtown Lorain. \n\u201cIt really depends on the reaction,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a hospitable reaction from the Lorain community, we\u2019ll bring it back. Certainly it\u2019s conceived as an ongoing event. All of the festivals I developed in the past have been ongoing, so it\u2019s certainly with that hope.\u201d \nContact John Benson \nat ndiffrence@att.net.", "source": "Elyria Chronicle Telegram"}
