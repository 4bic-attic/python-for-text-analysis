Each card has a different professional football player and a hand will always include a quarterback, kicker, running back, and two wide receivers. Those players are selected from any of the 32 football teams, with two trades allowed per hand. Points are earned based on each player's stats from the randomly determined year and week of the season for that round. The winner is then determined at the end of six rounds.\n\nTo better understand the demand for a casual fantasy sports game, FlowPlay surveyed more than 4,700 Vegas World players on their casual game playing habits and interest in fantasy sports. The findings reveal that 57 percent of the most dedicated casual gamers would be more inclined to play fantasy sports if real money was not involved. Further, users that classified themselves as fantasy sports players \u2013 79 percent \u2013 said they would also engage more if there was an option to do so without using real money. \n\nAdditional statistics from the survey include:\n\n\"With the current landscape of the fantasy sports market, millions of sports enthusiasts have largely been alienated from engaging in fantasy sports due to the complexity and time required to play the existing products,\" said Derrick Morton \n\nIn addition to FlowPlay's flagship social casino Vegas World, the company also developed the industry's first social casino white-label product.
