The IRA has gone.\u201d \n\nTUV leader Jim Allister said he does not believe Sinn Fein would admit to the IRA\u2019s ongoing existence, \u201cbut so what if they did? Would that stop incidents like this?\u201d \n\nIt had been reported by the Belfast Telegraph that the sympathy card bearing the initials \u2018IRA\u2019 had been sent to the home of Martina McDonnell. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nIt is said the bullet inside it was similar to that used in a rifle. \n\nBelfast man Mr McGuigan shot dead outside his home in Belfast\u2019s republican-dominated Short Strand last month. \n\nThe ex-IRA man is thought to have been killed by former republican comrades, as well as a group styling itself Action Against Drugs, after Mr McGuigan was blamed by some for the earlier killing of IRA figure Gerard \u2018Jock\u2019 Davison in Belfast\u2019s Markets district. \n\nThe PSNI could not be reached last night, with the media enquiries line either engaged or unobtainable. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nHowever, Ms McDonnell was reported as saying that police are aware of the incident and had advised the McDonnell family to take safety precautions.", "source": "NewsLetter"}
