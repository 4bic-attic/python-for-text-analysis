Both  charge users based on metered consumption of chilled water. Residents, however, are questioning a new \u201cinfrastructure service charge\u201d that they claim has resulted in huge increases to their monthly bill. \n \n\u201cIn effect, this has increased our monthly chilled water charge by between 50 and 300 per cent,\u201d said Briton M\u2009W, who has been living in Al Zeina for a year. \u201cIn my case, it\u2019s a 132 per cent increase.\u201d \n\nThe 60-year-old was paying an average of Dh260 a month to Dimarco compared with the Dh600 a month he now pays to Tasleem. He said that 33 per cent of the amount was because of the infrastructure charge. \n \n\u201cWithout Tasleem\u2019s infrastructure charge, it would still be a 35 per cent increase over Dimarco,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the warmer weather of late, I could accept this. I would liken this to staying in a hotel, then having my room rate doubled to cover hotel maintenance.\u201d \n\nA Dutch tenant in Al Zeina said the charges should be based on consumption only. \n\nHer Tasleem bill amounted to Dh332 of which Dh44.09 was the metred usage. Dh288 was the infrastructure charge. \n \n\u201cThe more you use, the more you pay,\u201d I\u2009S said. \u201cAlso, this would mean that clients that are environmentally conscious are better off.\u201d \n\nAn Al Muneera resident said he used to pay Dimarco between Dh1,000 and Dh1,200 a year for consumption charges on a three-bedroom apartment, with no fixed monthly fee. \n\n\u201cWe used to pay Dimarco Dh60 during the normally hot months and Dh150 during the hotter months,\u201d said  A\u2009L, 40. \n \n\u201cMy bill for July was Dh354, Dh66 of which was for consumption and Dh288 for what they call the infrastructure service charge,\u201d the Italian said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. You cannot change the company name, provide the same service and ask four times more than what we were paying before.\u201d \n\nEmirati A\u2009A, however, said he had experienced a drop in prices. \u201cI have owned a villa in Al Raha Gardens since 2010 and in comparison to last year\u2019s June/July bill of Dh1,800, I have seen it drop this year to Dh1,200.\u201d \n \nA Tasleem spokesman said the infrastructure charge was \u201cnot an additional charge levied by the company, and had always been part of the overall cooling fees paid by consumers\u201d. \n\n\u201cTasleem has separated the infrastructure service charge from the consumption charge to bring greater transparency to customers\u2019 invoices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fee structure is a  standard industry practice, and is in line with global benchmarks.\u201d \n \nResidents also complained of being required to pay a Dh3,000 deposit, 300 per cent more than that charged by Dimarco. \n\nrruiz@thenational.ae", "source": "Abu Dhabi National"}
