Statistics released yesterday by statistician-general Pali Lehohla show more and more children are being born to mothers with absent partners.\n\n\u201cResults show that some never-married mothers are not equipped with the capacity to facilitate National Development Plan goals related to children by 2030,\u201d he said.\n\nThese plans include better economic security for youth and women. The results show almost half the mothers in the country are single and 53% of children are born to never-married mothers.\n\nMost of these mothers are aged between 15 and 29, only have a secondary education and 80% of that age group are unemployed. A total of 24% live in KwaZulu-Natal. \u201cThe absent father phenomenon is continuing and affects policy implications,\u201d Lehohla said.\n\n\u201cThis has potentially longterm effects, such as prospects for economic participation and the drain on welfare systems. \u201cWith the high proportion of working age, never-married mothers, the challenge is to provide skills, education and create jobs.\u201d", "source": "Citizen.co.za"}
