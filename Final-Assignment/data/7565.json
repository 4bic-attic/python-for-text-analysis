This is the question on everyone\u2019s lips following a few weeks of low auction clearance rates.\u00a0 \n\r \nAccording to CoreLogic RP Data, Sydney\u2019s clearance rate fell to 71% in the third week of Spring. Although that is still a strong result in anyone\u2019s language, it is the lowest clearance rate recorded all year and is well down on the 80%-plus clearances we consistently saw throughout winter.\u00a0 \n\r \nSo have we reached or passed the peak?\u00a0 \n\r \nI\u2019ve been in real estate for more than 30 years and one thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 you can never pick the exact peak or trough of a market. It only becomes clear a few months after it\u2019s happened. My best guess is that we are about 80% through the cycle. But that\u2019s no reason for panic.\u00a0 \n\r \nIt\u2019s important to remember that a \u2018growth cycle\u2019 and a \u2018boom\u2019 are two different things. Booms occur within a broader growth cycle. Sydney is coming to the end of its boom but the growth cycle will continue for a little while yet. Sure, prices might come back a bit in response to the frenzy going out of the market, but growth will then resume at a slower and more stable pace.\u00a0 \n\r \nAccording to CoreLogic RP Data, Sydney\u2019s current growth cycle began around May 2012. So we\u2019re talking almost three and a half years of growth and within that, at least a couple of years of major boom conditions. The simple truth is it can\u2019t go on forever \u2013 if it did, then we\u2019d have problems. The market is cyclical and it\u2019s a pattern you can rely on.\u00a0 \n\r \nI\u2019d actually be concerned if Sydney has another year of double digit growth. What we need now is to put a floor under the fantastic growth we have seen since 2012 and consolidate this new level of pricing across the city with a period of calmer trading and price plateauing.\u00a0 \n\r \nWhat\u2019s going to end the boom?\u00a0 \n\r \nWell, it\u2019s not interest rates \u2013 they certainly won\u2019t be moving north for a while. The restrictions on investor lending are certainly having an effect, given the high volume of investor activity that has powered this cycle, but so far it hasn\u2019t been a crushing effect.\u00a0 \n\r \nWhat\u2019s going to end this boom is simple natural attrition. We\u2019ve had a long run of growth and soon enough it\u2019s going to peter out, simply because it\u2019s due to do so. \u00a0 \n\r \nLooking ahead, South-East Queensland is next. It will be Australia\u2019s hottest market for the next three years. We\u2019re already seeing lots of positive signs up north. Investors who feel they\u2019ve missed the boat with Sydney and Melbourne should look to Brisbane and the Gold Coast for opportunities now.\u00a0 \n\r \nHow much would you have given in 2012 to know that Sydney prices were about to skyrocket by almost 50% over the next three years? Would you have bought? Well, I think you\u2019ll be looking back in 2018 and saying the same thing about South-East Queensland in 2015.\u00a0 \n\r\n\r \nPublished: Tuesday, September 29, 2015 \n\r\n\r \n\r View the discussion thread.", "source": "Switzer"}
