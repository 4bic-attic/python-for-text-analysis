But Obama said he was willing to work with Russia and Iran to end it. \n \nRouhani blamed the crisis in the Middle East on what he characterized as the United States\u2019 occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as what he said was Washington\u2019s support for Israel against Palestine. \n \n\u201cIf we did not have the U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the U.S.\u2019s unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the Zionist regime against the oppressed nation of Palestine, today the terrorists would not have an excuse for the justification of their crimes,\u201d he said. \n \nRouhani praised the nuclear deal reached in July between Iran and major world powers, which will lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. \n \n\u201cThe deal is a brilliant example of victory over war that has managed to disperse the clouds of hostility and perhaps even the specter of another war and extensive tensions from the Middle East,\u201d Rouhani said. \n \nHe criticized the \u201cincompetence and mismanagement of those in charge\u201d of the haj tragedy in Saudi Arabia, in which more than 700 Muslim pilgrims were killed, including many Iranians. \n \nRouhani is cutting his U.N. trip short, returning to Teheran later on Monday to take part in ceremonies for the return of the bodies of Iranian pilgrims killed in the tragedy. \n \nAcross the street from the United Nations complex, a crowd of demonstrators gathered to protest the state of human rights under Rouhani and the Iranian government. Reuters photographers estimated the number of protesters at between 500 and 9", "source": "Raw Story"}
