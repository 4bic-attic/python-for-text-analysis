Umbrella Corps is set in the present day of Resident Evil, which means it\u2019s after the events of Resident Evil 6,\u201d Kawata began. \u201cIt\u2019s almost in an ironic way that we\u2019re using the title Umbrella Corps. If you know your Resident Evil lore, Umbrella no longer exists at this time in the universe; it\u2019s been destroyed. There\u2019s definitely a kind of a background of the Resident Evil universe that forms the basis of the game\u2019s premise.\u201d Looks like Umbrella\u2019s coming back. Do you think this is a set up for\u00a0Resident Evil 7\u00a0proper? Umbrella Corps will be available in 2016 on both Windows PC and PS4.", "source": "Stevivor"}
