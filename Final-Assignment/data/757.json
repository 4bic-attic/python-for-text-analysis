Six of the suspects face riot and assault charges stemming from yet another incident, a violent confrontation on Delafield Street April 25. \n \nThe announcement of the arrests, coming just before the start of the college football season, is yet another mark against Rutgers athletics, at a particularly bad time for head coach Kyle Flood . It is also another test for the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, which just this week announced the outcome of the last high-profile case of football players' alleged violence in the Sayreville hazing incident. \n \nAlong with the five recently active players, who have all been suspended from the team , the suspects include the daughter of a high school football coach and a brother of one of the players. The suspects also include a former Rutgers University player, \u00a0Tejay Johnson, 23, who was charged on Aug. 5 with armed robbery, criminal restraint and weapons offenses, court records show. It was not the first time the standout defensive back was in legal trouble \u2014 he was accused of beating and robbing a man in Egg Harbor, charges that were later dropped . \n \n\"It's heartbreaking,\" said a college coach in Johnson's hometown of Egg Harbor who followed his career. \"We were just talking about him. Was he going back to Rutgers this year?\" \n \nIn addition to Johnson \u2014 alleged to be involved in every incident and jailed on $650,000 bail \u2014 the other suspects are: \n Andre Boggs, a starting cornerback , who is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick. He was involved in the Hartwell Street and Livingston College invasions, authorities said. He has been widely regarded as a hero in his native Coatesville, Pa., a small rural town where, as one resident said Thursday, \"everybody knows everybody.\"  Nadir Barnwell, the cornerback whose academic status the head coach allegedly meddled in. He was charged with aggravated assault and riot in the alleged Delafield assault. Thursday evening, he was in the process of being bailed out of jail, records show.  Ruhann Peele, who has just moved past his own legal issues stemming from an assault charge , was jailed on $25,000 bail, according to records. He was also accused in the Delafield assault. \"I hope this doesn't affect his scholarship,\" said Dr. Marlena Berghammer, a neighbor of Peele's mother. \"I hope he doesn't [lose it], he was the one in his family his mother was counting on. His mother works so hard,\" she said, also describing Peele as a \"good boy\" who \"keeps to himself.\"  Rahzonn Gross, a sophomore fullback who allegedly participated in the attack on Delafield Street. Bail was set at $25,000, prosecutors said.  Delon Stephenson, a junior defensive back from Sayreville, also charged in the Delafield attack. Bail was set at $75,000.  Daryl Stephenson, Delon's brother, who prosecutors said Thursday was still at large. Bail was set at $25,000, again in the alleged Delafield attack.
