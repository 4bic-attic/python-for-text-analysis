'I just think no. I can do this by myself and I will do.'\u00a0 \n\nJian's determination has become an inspiration to his fellow teammates, his family and even those further afield. \n\nHe constantly pushes himself to achieve - and out achieve - boys his age and never wants his disability to get in the way.\u00a0 \n\n'He doesn't like it when people help him. He just wants to be treated as a normal kid,' his father Mark told the broadcaster.\u00a0 \n    \nKicker: Although he doesn't have hands or arms with which to catch or throw, the one thing that he excels at, is kicking. Here he is seen preparing to kick the ball \n \nLoving the outdoors: Jian skis and goes hiking with his mom and two older sisters \n   \nSupport: Jian was adopted from China when he was 2 1/2 years old. His adoptive mother Tana does not know the reason he was born without arms \n\n'It takes a lot of guts to go out there. He doesn't have any hands to support himself if he gets pushed down.' \n\nAnd it isn't only football where Jian is smashing prejudice.\u00a0 \n\nHe loves cars and go-carts. He rides his bike, skis and goes hiking with his adoptive mother, Tana, and two older sisters, Natalea and Kallea. \n\nThe family were never told what illness cause Jian's birth disability but the brave youngster has never seen it as a hurdle. In fact, he was never interested in pursuing prosthetics until he needed to wear them to ride his bike.", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
