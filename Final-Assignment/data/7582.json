They will not cash out or exit Sun TV,\u201d Narayanan firmly stated.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, the network is also expecting an increase in subscriptions while the Phase III and IV of the TV digitisation continues, as per Narayanan. Sun TV\u2019s subscription income for the year ended 31 March, 2015 was Rs 738 crore as compared to Rs 644 crore during the previous year.\n\u00a0\nThe company's ad sales revenue also witnessed a growth of 6.5 per cent at to Rs 1,136.09 crore during the year ended 31 March, 2015 as compared to Rs 1,067.04 crore during the previous year.\n\u00a0\nApart from the case that Maran is fighting against charges of money laundering, the Sun TV Network was also in the news for being denied security clearance by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoreover, according to media reports, Sun TV\u2019s AGM also saw a shareholder raising concerns over the huge disparity in income of Kalanithi Maran and the company\u2019s independent directors. It was reported that Maran and his wife took home a salary of Rs 61 crore each in the year ended 31 March. Juxtaposed to that, Sun TV\u2019s independent directors get a fee of up to Rs 26,000.\n\u00a0\nDespite the trials and tribulations that the company has been facing over the last few months, Narayanan remained optimistic about the company\u2019s future. \u201cWe have been through difficult times and will come out completely unscathed. I am confident, at the end, truth will prevail and we will come out (with) flying colours,\u201d he said.", "source": "Indian Television Dot Com"}
