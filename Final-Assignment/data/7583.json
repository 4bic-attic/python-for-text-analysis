Climate change is causing serious damage now, it is not an event of the future,\u201d he told AFP. \n\nThe so-called COP21 talks in Paris will seek a binding deal to take effect in 2020 that will commit all nations to emissions cuts. \n\nThe goal is to limit average global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \n\n\u2013 \u2018Unviable very soon\u2019 \u2013 \n\nFormer New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said the Paris talks could determine the future of Pacific territories such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tokelau. \n\n\u201cIf you get a metre of inundation by the tides then some of those countries are going to become unviable very soon,\u201d he told a climate discussion in Wellington organised by the French embassy. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking there at the destruction of a culture. This is terrible and we\u2019re not doing anything about it.\u201d \n\nAustralia and New Zealand, the two largest PIF members, have been accused of dragging their feet on climate change, but Kiribati President Anote Tong said small island nations would not allow them to water down the PIF\u2019s call for action. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what problems these countries have\u2026 but we\u2019ll have a very big problem if we don\u2019t have strong language,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need action as soon as possible.\u201d \n\nAnother issue set for discussion at the PIF meeting is a clampdown on civil rights in Nauru which prompted New Zealand on Wednesday to suspend foreign aid to the country\u2019s justice sector. \n\nThe UN and United States have called for restoration of basic freedoms in Nauru, saying they are fundamental to democracy, and New Zealand has said it will air its concerns in Port Moresby. \n\nThe Pacific\u2019s multi-billion dollar tuna industry will also be under scrutiny. It is an economic lifeline for some nations but vulnerable to poaching and overfishing. \n\nThe talks are also set to touch on regional integration, potentially allowing French Polynesia in as a full member, and curbing an obesity epidemic in the Pacific. \n\n\u00a9 2015 AFP", "source": "Roodepoort Record"}
