The third set was a little bit of a struggle but we found out a way to get some things going late against a good team.\u00a0 I really liked the offensive balance.\u00a0 The kids game-planned really well.\u00a0 We did an extremely good job on number 11; kind of their go to, so that was good to see.\u00a0 We didn't manage the left side as well as we would have liked to and have to do a better job of playing them.\u00a0 Overall, a pretty fun night at Horejsi.\" \n\nOn the struggles of the third set: \n\n\"Our releases and timing of the block was a little bit off, and the ball was bouncing their way a little bit, but we come right back and respond.\u00a0 At 24-23, a lot of coaches would have used a time out but I have a lot of trust in this group.\u00a0 You're going to have sets like that where everything doesn't go to plan, but you still figure out how to get it done.\" \n\nOn the early season success: \n\n\"We're playing pretty good this early.\u00a0 I think the foreign trip helped this whole group, but I think these girls enjoy playing with each other and they are finding that out.\u00a0 It's the first couple of weekends and they like playing around each other and being around each other, so hopefully they can keep that going.\" \n\nSenior Outside Hitter Tiana Dockery \n\nOn the match against Duke: \n\n\"It was a pretty good day for our whole team, especially because Coach B earned his 300th win, so it was really exciting.\u00a0 I feel like our team did really well.\u00a0 We kept ourselves together even on down parts during the match.\" \n\nOn the adjustments made during the 3rd set: \n\n\"When we have a passer who is passing a little off, we talk to them a little bit and shift over to give her a little bit less responsibility, so she can get her momentum back afterwards.\u00a0 I think Madison (Rigdon) is very level headed, so she can mess up maybe two or three times and still kill it the next 10 or 20 times.\u00a0 She does really well on that.\" \n\nOn not playing in the morning match: \n\n\"I was very eager to come back, but we've been eager pretty much this whole week trying to play this tournament \u2013 tournaments are our favorite.\u00a0 I feel like today was awesome.\u00a0 We have one more game to go, so we are not completely done.\"\u00a0", "source": "University of Kansas Athletics"}
