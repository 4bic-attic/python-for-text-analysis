He also doesn\u2019t like being pressured into taking selfies with the fans, saying in a new video that an open request for a photo would do a better job at convincing him. \n \nBecause wherever he goes chaos ensues, Justin went through the trouble of putting together a SnapChat video (see below), in which he lays out some ground rules for fans, for their interaction with him. \n \nFirst of all, Justin says that respect is the most important: he wants his Beliebers to enjoy the experience of meeting him, but he will turn his back on them and not even acknowledge their presence if they become too unruly. \n \nIt might sound ridiculous for a celebrity to issue guidelines for fans, but this is Justin Bieber we\u2019re talking about. His fans are known to be very passionate and hysteric, to the point where he can\u2019t take a walk from a store to his car without dozens of them running towards him, crying, yelling his name and clutching their phones in the hope they might score a selfie. \n \nJustin actually makes a lot of sense in saying these things on camera, in the hope that they might not fall on deaf Belieber ears.", "source": "Softpedia"}
