The study, which celebrated its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, switches automatically from design mode to aerodynamic mode when the vehicle reaches 50 mph, whereby numerous aerodynamics measures alter the shape of the vehicle. Inside, the Concept IAA continues the design line of the S-Class and S-Class Coupe, offers new touch-based functions and provides an idea of what the interior of a business saloon might look like in the near future. At the touch of a button, or automatically at approximately 50 mph, the vehicle performs a transformation in which the four-door coupe turns into an aerodynamics world champion: eight segments extend at the rear, increasing its length by up to 15.3 inches; front flaps in the front bumper extend by nearly an inch to the front and 20mm to the rear, improving the airflow around the front end and the front wheel arches; the Active Rims alter their cupping from 55mm to zero; and the louver in the front bumper moves 60mm to the rear, improving the underbody airflow. \u201cFascinating and technically sophisticated cars form the core of Mercedes-Benz. The Concept IAA applies intelligent innovations to resolve the conflicting aims of functionality and aesthetics and shows that we still have plenty of ideas on how to achieve further improvements in efficiency,\u201d said Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, member of the Daimler Board of Management responsible for Group Research and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.
