The exclusive Competition Edition stands for exceptional individuality, thanks to its special paintwork colours, components made of high-tech carbon fibre, fine leathers with coordinated contrast stitching and a range of unusual details, BMW says. \n \nIt also brings more power, boosting the 4.4 litre V8 turbo\u2019s output to round figures of 600 hp and 700 Nm (up 40 hp, 20 Nm). This takes the an M Driver\u2019s Package equipped car to a top speed of 305 km/h. 0-100 km/h in 3.9 seconds. \n \nTwo exterior paintwork colours: dazzling Alpine White with M stripes seen here and luminous Austin Yellow metallic. The shoes are matte black 20-inch M light-alloys (double-spoke 343 M, staggered tyres), and there\u2019s black chrome on the kidney grille, door handles and side gills, with M6 Competition script on the latter. Carbon fibre can be found on the mirror caps, rear spoiler and diffuser. \n   \nInside, BMW Individual fine-grain Merino full leather in black with contrast stitching, M6 Competition lettering in metal on the door sills, along with the name on the cupholder lid, are further reminders of the car\u2019s identity. Interior trim strips, gear selector and steering wheel spokes are made from CF. The steering wheel rim is lined with Alcantara. \n \nM multifunction seats for the driver and front passenger and head-up display are part of the equipment list.
