He picked Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, because she \u201crestored the United Kingdom to greatness.\u201d \n\nThe Post noted that Irish Central first galvanized the fierce Irish criticism. \n\n\u201cOn Friday morning, IrishCentral.com, published an article: \u201c Jeb Bush insults Irish by picking Margaret Thatcher for the $10 bill .\u201d \n\n\u201cTo put such a woman on an American banknote would be the greatest insult possible to the millions of Irish Americans who trace their roots to fleeing famine, war and persecution and religious bigotry \u2013 something akin to what the American forces faced when fighting for independence the same way the Irish did,\u201d the IrishCentral.com article says. \n\nThe Post said the Irish American vote was hard to gauge. \u201cNow, we\u2019re sure all 35 million or so Americans with Irish heritage aren\u2019t writing off Bush because of his Thatcher fandom. And there\u2019s debate over whether there\u2019s an actual Irish-American voting bloc similar to Latino or women voters that politicians vie for. But Bush probably can\u2019t afford to alienate any voter at this point.\u201d \n\nThey stated he has now changed his opinion. The Washington Post said that \u201cAware of his missed opportunity, he told NBC Thursday that the choice of who to put on the $10 bill should really be left to the American people. \n\n\u201cIt could create all sorts of opportunities for math teachers to teach math, for social studies teachers to do the same. You could have an avalanche of interest in picking the woman that should be on the $10 bill,\u201d he said. \n\nA good win for the Irish!", "source": "Irish Central"}
