We fell way below our standards \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \n\u201cSo it was good to have that inquest because maybe more good than bad comes out of those types of meetings and hopefully it sets us up well for the next run of games. It\u2019s good the players are having an inquest \u2013 they\u2019re angry and they\u2019re hurting because they want higher standards \n\n\u201cWe spoke about out standards, what we do well, how we move the ball, how we take care of possession and how we take chances. We should be patient in possession and we weren\u2019t today - we gave the ball away too many times and we were too sloppy. \n\n\u201cThe performance isn\u2019t just the goals \u2013 it\u2019s how we move the ball, rotate in midfield, how we keep our shape, and how and where we press them.\u201d \n\nMark had words of praise for captain Lee Wallace who scored the opening goal and for Martyn Waghorn, whose goal was his first in open play at Ibrox. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cIt was a tremendous strike from Lee; I think he is worried about James Tavernier getting away from him in the goal scoring stakes\u2026they are two full-backs who are keen to get forward and  keen to score whilst Martyn is a quality player and he will get better and better. \n\n\u201cHe just needs to have a run of games to get fitness and confidence, which we spoke about when he arrived. \n\n\u201cHis work rate, his application and his desire to do well for the club is unquestionable.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile substitute Nicky Law was delighted to net his first goal of the season. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cIt was something I felt I needed as it seems just about everyone else in the squad has scored a goal so far this season. So I was delighted to get off the mark - and hopefully the goals will start to come again now. I managed to make the run, and you always know that Kenny will put the ball on a plate for you, so it was great play from him, and I managed to put it in the roof of the net and put the game to bed.\u201d \n\nNicky has had to be content with a place on the bench recently \u2013 and he recognised the competition for places that now exists. \n\n\u201cThe new boys that have come in have been brilliant. The fans have really taken to them. The squad\u2019s got a lot of depth \u2013 but when my chances come I\u2019ve just got to try and impress the manager.\u201d \n\nThe midfielder confirmed that there had been a full and frank exchange of views post-match. \n\n\u201cWe had five or ten minutes in the dressing-room after the game.  The manager came in and we all agreed that we had fallen below our standards today. The Managers demands the best \u2013 not just in games but in training as well. It was flat, and you could sense that from the word go. It wasn\u2019t an ideal game for us \u2013 we gave the ball away too cheaply. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cThe tempo wasn\u2019t as high as it has been, and there were too many loose passes \u2013 probably as many as we\u2019ve had all season in the one game today. There\u2019s a lot of unhappy people in there \u2013 and that tells you how far we\u2019ve come in a short space of time.\u201d \n\nThe midfielder did recognise that opponents Livingston had played a part in making life rather difficult for the Light Blues. \n\n\u201cSome credit has to go to Livingston.  I was impressed with them - they were really well organised and made it difficult for us. \n\n\u201cHowever it\u2019s still a 3-0 victory, another three points and a step closer to where we want to be at the end of the season - so we can\u2019t be too downhearted, although we know we fell below our standards so we\u2019ll use it as a learning curve. \n\n\u201cOn another day, we could have been punished \u2013 last year we might not even have won that game - but we feel we\u2019ve come a long way in a short period of time. Ten wins out of ten is more than we could have asked for \u2013 and now we\u2019ll be looking to make it eleven.\u201d", "source": "NewsLetter"}
