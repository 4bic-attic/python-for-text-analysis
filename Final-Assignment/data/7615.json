The device is controlled through an app on the parent\u2019s smartphone and it will sound an alarm if it detects that their child is strapped in the car seat while they are walking away. \n\nThis year alone, 18 children in the United States have died of heat stroke in cars, and more than half of children who die \u201care simply left behind by a caregiver who had forgotten they are in the backseat,\u201d Today reports. \n\nMiller, who has a 16-month-old daughter, said she \u201chas heard the stories all too often\u201d about children dying in scorching hot cars.
