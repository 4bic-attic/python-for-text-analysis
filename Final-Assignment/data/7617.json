There are two ways to play the game, the first aim of the game is to help Father Christmas decorate his tree and the second game is to collect as many presents as you can for Father Christmas's sack. You need to throw the dice and match the shapes or colours to the festive board in front of you. The reviews seem pretty good on this item and it looks a fab price to keep by for Christmas.
