Russell Wilson running for his life at times behind a revamped offensive line, a stirring fourth-quarter comeback, a defensive slip that only served to magnify Kam Chancellor\u2019s absence, a strange kickoff to begin overtime. And yes, the Seahawks getting stopped one yard short again. It all added up to a 34-31 overtime loss to the Rams that gave national media plenty to chew on after the fact\u2026 Most Read StoriesSeattle\u2019s black community reels from killings of young men\nSeahawks get hit hard with a dose of reality in losing 34-31 to the RamsEx-fighter pilot recalls her 9/11 suicide missionSeahawks\u2019 grades of the game: All phases get low marks in opening loss to Rams4.0 earthquake shakes Eastside; no reports of damage\nPeter King, in his Monday Morning Quarterback column, mentioned the Seahawks-Rams game plenty but had this to say about the Steven Hauschka\u2019s overtime kickoff, which earned the kicker King\u2019s \u201cGoat of the Week\u201d citation: \u201cThe play at the start of overtime in St. Louis looked absurd: Hauschka seeming to onside-kick, and the Rams recovering at midfield. What in the world was\u00a0that?\u00a0Turns out it was supposed to be a pooch kick, booted sky-high to land at the 25 or 30, so either the Seahawks would have a fighting chance to win a jump ball for it (or capture a bouncer), or the ball would be recovered and not returned. Hauschka\u00a0simply blew it, and that created a stupidly short drive (six plays, 30 yards) to the Rams field goal that turned out to be the game-winner.\u201d Sports Illustrated\u2019s Doug Farrar said the absence of Chancellor made the Seahawks look all too ordinary on defense: \u201cMoreso than usual, Seattle\u2019s defense allowed voids and gaps in the intermediate areas, which are the areas Chancellor generally patrols. They were not the same defense when Chancellor played through injuries in the early part of the 2014 season, and they\u2019re not the same defense now.\u201d Don Banks, also of Sports Illustrated, said it was not the type of opener that will help the Seahawks move on from the Super Bowl: \u201cAdd in the Seattle onside kick that wasn\u2019t supposed to be an onside kick at the start of overtime\u2014kicker Steven Hauschka said he mis-hit the kick and was intending to bloop it down field\u2014and the Seahawks\u2019 penchant for recent self-destruction got re-enforced on Sunday rather than erased. And with that kind of ill-fated start to the 2015 season, nothing about the specter of how last season ended is going away any time soon in Seattle.\u201d Adam Kilgore of The Washington Post attempted to dissect the logic of the Seahawks\u2019 kickoff to start overtime: \u201cThe thing is, once you get beyond the initial, ohymygodwhatishedoing shock, Carroll\u2019s decision to onside kick at the start of overtime was a sound, smart tactic. \u2026 If Carroll did want some kind of kick designed to get the ball back, the call also revealed something about how Carroll views his vaunted defense, a unit that suddenly appears shaky.\u201d NFL.com\u2019s Gregg Rosenthal had several takeaways from the game, including one about the final play: \u201cThe conversation in Seattle this week will be about offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell\u2019s decision to run Marshawn Lynch on 4th-and-1 in overtime with the Seahawks trailing by three. It was the sensible call, even if it would have shown true guts to throw a slant pass like they did in the Super Bowl.\u201d ESPN.com\u2019s Sheil Kapadia put the onus on the Seahawks\u2019 defense: \u201cThe defense gave up eight plays of 20 yards or more on the day. Foles went 18-for-27 for 297 yards and a touchdown. The Rams were without their top two running backs in Todd Gurley and Tre Mason. They were also missing starting wide receiver Brian Quick. But Foles averaged 11.0 yards per attempt and moved the ball up and down the field.\u201d Alex Marvez of FoxSports.com sees plenty to be worried about on offense for Seattle in his Week 1 Quick Reads column: \u201cSeahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell must feel cursed. After being lambasted for his ill-fated decision to pass in the final seconds of Super Bowl XLIX, Bevell was unsuccessful again with another play call in a crucial short-yardage situation. The Rams stuffed running back Marshawn Lynch on fourth-and-1 in overtime to win.\u201d Benjamin Hochman of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the Rams\u2019 victory was a reprieve for St. Louis fans: \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a summer for everyone who cares about the St. Louis Rams. For (Jeff) Fisher, it\u2019s tough enough just to be a head coach in this league, let alone with LA looming. And for a day, they were winners. And they didn\u2019t beat just any team. They beat the Seahawks.\u201d \u00a0", "source": "The Seattle Times \u00bb Sections \u00bb Seahawks"}
