This would, in turn, allow that capacity to be used to produce more lower-sulfur gasoline than is currently possible. Any increased supply of lower-sulfur gasoline to Mexico\u2019s motor gasoline market, which consumed 761,000 b/d in 2013, would result in reduced sulfur emissions and other environmental benefits.\r \r  \nCurrently, U.S. Gulf Coast refineries are better suited to process heavy sour crude and Mexican refineries are more equipped to process heavier crude. \n \nMany are hoping this new policy signifies a shift in opinion about the oil export ban that has been in effect since the 1970\u2019s, but some analysts believe the effort may be mostly symbolic.\u00a0Read more:\u00a0 Mexico Oil Swap Not Significant \n The following two tabs change content below.
