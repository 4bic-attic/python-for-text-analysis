One of the newest HomePlug AV2 MIMO powerline networking products to hit the market is also the fastest we\u2019ve seen. With average throughput of 363 megabits per second in our JPerf tests, the Extollo LANSocket 1500 kit beat our previous speed champ, the D-Link Powerline AV2 2000 (DHP-701AV) by almost 14Mbps. The results weren\u2019t particularly surprising given that both products are based on the same Broadcom chips designed to increase speed by supporting the maximum frequency range (2- to 85MHz) of the HomePlug AV2 MIMO spec. D-Link\u2019s adapters averaged a bit less than 350Mbps\u2014which is still a good deal faster than the rates for adapters based on AV2 MIMO chips that only operate in the 2- to 68MHz range.
