Pay the rent? Buy food? \n \nFor some, it\u2019s possible to do only one. For many, it\u2019s impossible to do all three. \n \nThese are people living on the edge, barely getting by. \n \nFor others, more financially comfortable, the choices might be easier, but money\u2019s still tight. \n \nHow do you save for retirement? Or pay the kids\u2019 college tuition \u2013 now or in the future? Or find the cash for that emergency repair? \n \n\u201cEconomy\u201d is one of those fancy financial words that officials, and the media, use too often. The only \u201ceconomy\u201d most folks are concerned about? How much money is in their wallet. In their purse. In their bank account. In their paycheck. In their hand. \n  \nStuart Shinske\u00a0 (Photo: Journal file) \n  \nThis is why the Poughkeepsie Journal has started a series of special reports called \u201cMoney Wise.\u201d Through the end of the year, stories will examine how real people are making tough decisions about how to stretch their money. \n \nThere\u2019s a growing gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave nots\u201d in the mid-Hudson Valley \u2014 and many families that had been getting by are finding, with years of higher costs, lower or no pay raises and more turnover in jobs, that they have to tighten their belts more \u2013 or much more. \n \nOur first report Sept. 6 profiled\u00a0\u201ccord cutters\u201d \u2013 those saving big bucks by stopping cable television service and, instead, watching shows via less-expensive options such as Netflix, Hulu and apps. The money, instead, is going toward more pressing needs. \n \nStill, news stories, while informative and instructive, might not help you find the precise\u00a0answer to your personal\u00a0crisis or situation. \n \nWe\u2019re planning an event designed to do just that. \n \nAn expo at the Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel Nov. 21 will offer readers immediate access to experts in a variety of money-management areas. Numerous local businesses and organizations will offer advice, services and more. We\u2019re expecting financial counselors. Contractors. Career experts. Insurance representatives. College representatives. Counselors from social programs. Couponing gurus. Healthcare companies. Banks. Folks who can talk about reducing debt. Paying less taxes. And making more money. \n \nThey\u2019ll introduce you to their services. The next step is up to you. \n \nMaybe the best part? Attendance is free. We want to provide an important public service for all. \n \nMeanwhile, check out next Sunday\u2019s Journal for our next installment in this series.
