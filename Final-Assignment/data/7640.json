Well, believe it or not, an inventor from Cincinnati, Ohio has just what you're looking for. \n\nHe developed TELEVISION BORDER to enhance the appearance of a flat screen television with color and design. It fits tightly and stays in place to protect the television screen border against damage. What's more, it can be easily installed and removed with no adhesive residue. In use, it fits tightly and stays in place to protect the television screen border against damage. However, it does not interfere with the function of the television. At the same time, it accommodates a variety of flat screen television brands and styles. Also, it is decorative, lightweight and affordably priced. In addition, it adapts to a variety of room decor styles. \n   \nThe inventor's personal observations inspired the idea. \"Because of the growing popularity of cell phone cases that look like borders, I realized the same idea could be applied to televisions to give them a unique appearance,\" he said. \n\nThe original design was submitted to the Cincinnati office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
