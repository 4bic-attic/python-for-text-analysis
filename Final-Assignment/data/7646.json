We\u2019ve got great variety in the centres.\u201d \n\nEight days after lining up opposite Fijian giant Nemani Nadolo, Watson must steel himself for a duel with another colossal wing in Wales\u2019 George North. \n\n\u201cNadolo was good preparation for North. They are both big players,\u201d Watson said. \n\n\u201cThey are slightly different \u2013 I think George is probably a bit quicker than Nadolo, so he has got that threat there as well. He is a quality player. \n\n\u201cGeorge North is a player I have massive respect for. He is a British and Irish Lion, he has a lot of caps already for Wales, so he is definitely a special player for them, someone we have to be on our money with defensively.\u201d \n\nWatson has been escaping the pressure-cooker environment of a home World Cup by spending rest days with his family at their home near the squad\u2019s Surrey training base. \n\n\u201cMy parents only live 20 minutes from the hotel, so I\u2019m spending most of my free time back at my parents,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cMy days off I spend my time there relaxing with them. That\u2019s something I really enjoy and nice to have them so close, especially at a time like this. \n\n\u201cI always try to eat the right thing but I can\u2019t help myself when I go home and my mum\u2019s made some Nigerian food. I always tuck into that.\u201d", "source": "Western Morning News"}
