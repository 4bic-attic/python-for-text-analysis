North American also sells these products into the MH and industrial markets, which we believe have upside potential,\" said Todd Cleveland \n\n\"The acquisition of North American marks one \n\nBob Wiley \n\nThe acquisition of North American was funded under the Company's newly expanded credit facility (see discussion below) and includes the acquisition of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, and machinery and equipment.
