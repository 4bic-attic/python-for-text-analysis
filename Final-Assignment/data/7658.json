It's the only way to put an end to the war in Syria,\" the daily wrote.\nBut it said that de Mistura's plan \"is aligned with the positions held by the 'opposition coalition,' America, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, who want the political solution to come before the fight against terrorism.\"\nThe US, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia have been leading backers of the political and armed opposition throughout Syria's conflict, which has forced millions to flee since it broke out in 2011.\nWashington has expressed serious concern in recent weeks that Russia, a decades-long backer of Syria's regime, is escalating its military aid to forces loyal to Assad.\nRussia has reportedly moved artillery units and tanks to an airport in Assad's coastal stronghold in Latakia province, along with dozens of personnel and temporary housing for hundreds more.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that Moscow had proposed opening a \"military-to-military conversation\" with Washington to ensure that Russian forces do not come into conflict with a US-led coalition fighting Islamic State group jihadists.\nKerry did not specify whether the proposed dialogue would include a joint fight against IS.\nCombined with Moscow's staunch backing for Assad, the arrival of thousands of Syrian asylum-seekers may also push Europe to adopt a new approach towards the regime, experts said.\n\"Indeed, after the migrant crisis, we heard several European voices pleading for a closer cooperation with Assad and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,\" said Karim Bitar, head of research at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations.\n\"Clearly, the 'stability at all costs' narrative is rapidly gaining ground. After the Libyan debacle and the unending Syrian tragedy, many people came to mistakenly believe that a return to authoritarianism is the only solution to the Middle East crisis,\" Bitar told AFP.\n\"The proponents of the 'Assad as a lesser-evil' theory are now more vocal and coming out openly in favour of a rapprochement with Assad to fight IS,\" he added.\nIS meanwhile has called on Muslims to seek safety in its so-called \"caliphate\" in areas of Syria and Iraq under its control following a string of migrant shipwreck tragedies.\nOne IS-produced video, depicting refugees trying to reach Europe, says refugees \"are living under their (European countries) laws humiliated and submissive, instead of fleeing to the land of Muslims to live in dignity under its sword\".\n\u00a0AFP\nahram.org.eg\n17/9/15\n--\n-\nRelated:\nMoscow: US must understand it's possible to fight IS only by joining efforts with Damascus Syrian army starts using new weapons from Russia...\u00a0 Obama Welcomes Putin\u2019s \u2018Constructive\u2019 Support on Syria US Considering Military Talks with Russia on Syria.
