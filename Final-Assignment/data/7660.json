But what surprised her most happened after she reported the incident to police. \n\n\n\"They said m'am if anything, after reviewing the tape, you could be arrested for harassment because I\u00a0had taken his picture at Target,\" she said.\u00a0 \n\n\nKroenke\u00a0admits\u00a0she shouldn't have taken his picture at a close range but\u00a0says that's no excuse for assault.\u00a0 \n\n\n\"I was surprised they would give him so much leeway when there's video of him striking me and me crying out for help,\" said Kroenke.\u00a0 \n\n\nIt happened in Alderman Tony Zielinski's district and he says\u00a0he sides with Kroenke. \n\n\u00a0 \n\"I think that if a citizen feels violated its their right and its their option to take whatever means necessary\u00a0within the law to protect themselves and get evidence,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\n\nMilwaukee police told us they have no record of this incident but said. \"We encourage the public to call the police when they see suspicious activity, however, we remind them not to put themselves into harm's\u00a0way while witnessing an incident.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile. Kroenke\u00a0says\u00a0she's interpreting \u00a0Sheriff Clarke's advice her own way. \n\n\n\"He's recommending concealed carry, which scares the crap out of me. How about concealed carry camera?\" she said.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \nAnd would do it again. \n\n\n\"I would just make sure I wasn't within swinging distance of someone when taking their picture,\" she said.\u00a0 \n\n\nWe reached out to Target to get a copy of the surveillance video and our request was denied.\u00a0 \n\u00a0", "source": "CBS 58"}
