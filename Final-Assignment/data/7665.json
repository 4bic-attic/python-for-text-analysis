Paul now resides in the Alexandria Safe-Zone, but eventually was forced back to the Hilltop Colony. While initially mistrusted by Rick Grimes and his group, he eventually gains their respect as a valued comrade.\u201d\n\nJesus being cast is quite possibly a sign that we will soon see Negan in the series, a villain the character seeks out Rick\u2019s help to bring down. Who and what else are we hoping to see in this season of The Walking Dead? Well, you can find that out by clicking right here.", "source": "HeyUGuys"}
