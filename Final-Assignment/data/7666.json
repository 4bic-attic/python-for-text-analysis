We had very little information \u2013 just the name of my father\u2019s sister, which turned out to be spelt wrong.\u201d \n \nIn 2008, Maria approached the British Red Cross to see if they could help her find her family. The British Red Cross works to restore contact between relatives who have been separated due to conflict, natural disaster or migration. \n \nThe British Red Cross sent a request to the Polish Red Cross hoping to find any sign of Maria\u2019s family through official records and archives. \n \nCheryl McLeish, international family tracing co-ordinator for the Red Cross in Worcestershire, said: \u201cWe take as much information as we can \u2013 names, dates of birth, last known address, that sort of thing and with permission pass these details over to relevant Red Cross societies in other countries so they can begin the search.\" \n   Promoted stories   \nIn the meantime, Maria made her own enquiries obtaining war records and doing everything she could to find out information. \n \nShe said: \"It does eat away at you when you can\u2019t find your own people.\" \n \nIn 2013 the British Red Cross confirmed that the Polish Red Cross had discovered that Maria\u2019s aunt Stanislawa had emigrated from Poland to Canada about 20 years ago. \n \nThe Canadian Red Cross started looking and after around 18 months confirmed that they had found a woman called Ewa, Stanislawa\u2019s granddaughter. \n \nMaria said: \u201cThe elation and disbelief - it was absolutely amazing.\" \n \nAfter talking online and swapping photographs, Maria travelled to Canada to meet her family in January this year, including her 92-year-old aunt. \n \nShe said: \u201cIt was just like meeting old friends. It was very weird at first but within the day, it felt like we had known each other forever.\" \n \nHer aunt was able to tell Maria about her father as a little boy, about her parents' wedding day. \n \nMaria said: \u201cShe remembers every detail, even the bride\u2019s dress and the weather. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\u201cI really can\u2019t thank the Red Cross enough for their help in tracing my family.\" \n \nIf someone has lost touch with a family member as a result of a conflict, natural disaster or migration they can contact Cheryl McLeish or James Simmonds on 0121 766 5444 or visit www.redcross.org.uk/trace.", "source": "Ledbury Reporter"}
