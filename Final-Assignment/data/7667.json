Chris Christie (R-N.J.) will be the first 2016 presidential candidate to appear on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d following its relaunch next week, Entertainment Weekly reported.\nNew host Trevor Noah reportedly plans on welcoming Christie for an interview during his Sept. 30 broadcast on Comedy Central.\nNoah said on Wednesday that he plans on continuing his predecessor Jon Stewart\u2019s comedic take on American news and politics.\nThe South African added that he is particularly interested in next year\u2019s presidential election given its size, scope and impact on the global stage.\n\u201cThe world watches your election,\u201d Noah told The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re watching who you\u2019re going to elect, because it often affects whether or not you\u2019re going to invade our country.\u201d\nChristie\u2019s appearance comes as he fights for attention in the crowded field, currently ranking tenth out of 15 candidates with 1.8 percent voter support, according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of national polls.\nNoah also said in an interview published on Wednesday that he is expanding the diversity of the show\u2019s staff to appeal to a wider audience.\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve joined, blackness has tremendously increased at the show,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an epidemic of blackness.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hired additional woman as well,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m very cognizant of. I know how easy it is for a system to unwittingly fall prey to, let\u2019s call it, an institutionalized segregation.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realize you\u2019re limited by your current network of who you know, and what you know is often [people like] you.\u201d", "source": "The Hill: Ballot Box"}
