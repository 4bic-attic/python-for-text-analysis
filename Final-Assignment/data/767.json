The condition of the South Sydney duo has improved considerably since they were rushed to St Vincent\u2019s hospital on Tuesday morning and they could be released by the end of the week.\n\nAfter being admitted in a critical condition, Rabbitohs CEO John Lee on Wednesday said that assessment has since been updated to good.\n\nLee said the pair were now free of medical equipment that was supporting them after their near-death experience.\n\nDRUGS: \u2018People are dying from this\u2019\n\nPLAGUE: \u2018Drug use sending players to the brink\u2019\n\nTROUBLE: Mark Geyer reveals addiction \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from critical to stable and now I can report that their condition is even better, it\u2019s good,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cBoth the players are very alert. They\u2019re communicating with medical staff and with their families.\u201d\n\nLee said Gray\u2019s situation was particularly dire.\n\n\u201cTheir health was paramount and that\u2019s why the medical staff at St Vincent\u2019s acted very quickly to stabilise them,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a very serious matter. If circumstances had been different, if there hadn\u2019t been another person at the unit, we might have been talking about a totally different event.\u201d\n\nThe incident intensifies the spotlight on one of league\u2019s biggest but quietly kept problems. Police and the NRL Integrity Unit are investigating.", "source": "FoxSports.com.au"}
