Cookswell Citroen in Pegswood provided funding for the event. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nLeanne Shipley, project officer at Groundwork North East & Cumbria, said: \u201cAs well as celebrating our 30th anniversary and the community and environmental projects we have carried out over those years, we wanted to showcase Pegswood Moor. \n\n\u201cMany people in the area aren\u2019t sure whether or not they are allowed on the site and so we organised the fun event so families could see that the land is available for the local community and they can get involved in the activities that will take place there in the future. \n\n\u201cWe had really good feedback from those who attended. A major positive was that children could have a go with tools they normally wouldn\u2019t be able to touch because there was a supervised and fully risk assessed environment for them. \n\n\u201cWe plan to run the activity day next year and hopefully by then more people will be aware of the site and we\u2019ll get a bigger attendance. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working to break down barriers by getting the message out to people that it\u2019s a superb facility for people of all ages.\u201d \n\nThe fire service and a local police officer also came along to the site \u2013 a restored former surface mine to the west of Pegswood. \n\nGroundwork North East & Cumbria will be making a funding application for a trainer so that when certain works are carried out at the site, they will be done as part of a training session open to residents who want to get a particular qualification or experience of a skill. \n\nIt is also hoping to run family activities over the Christmas holidays.", "source": "Morpeth Herald"}
