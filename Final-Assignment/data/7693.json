The patients received either adalimuamb or placebo plus daily topical antiseptic. The adalimumab-treated patients had greater reduction in abscesses and inflammatory nodules, compared with the placebo-treated cohort, according to the release. \u00a0Additionally, no new safety risks were identified. \n \nThe European Commission approved Humira for treating active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults in the European Union with inadequate response to conventional systemic treatment, according to the release. \n \nThe FDA approval is the ninth approved indication for Humira in the United States, according to the release. \u00a0 \n \nReference: www.abbvie.com", "source": "Orthopedics Today"}
