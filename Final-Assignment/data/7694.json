It's about 45 miles northwest of Albany. \n\nNo one was injured in the blaze. It destroyed the building, which was once a church. \n\nA prosecutor tells the Daily Gazette that shortly after the fire, 80-year-old Gary Lane and his 56-year-old wife, Audrey, filed $151,000 in insurance claims. They weren't paid. \n\nThe Lanes were indicted Friday on arson, insurance fraud and conspiracy charges. They were released on $10,000 bond each. \n\nA phone message left Saturday at their Gloversville home wasn't immediately returned.", "source": "Bellingham Herald"}
