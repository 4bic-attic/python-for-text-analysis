There are a lot of things that weigh on our minds at work, job performance among them. Unfortunately, sometimes there are some recurring thoughts of self-doubt that hold us back from being and doing our very best. Here\u2019s what to do about them.\u201cThis is just a temporary job.\u201d\u00a0\nMaybe you are not at your dream job. And even if you are one of the lucky ones who loves what he does, there is always room for more, right? You can always grow and reach new heights. But that doesn\u2019t mean that just because you\u2019re not at your dream job, it\u2019s okay to slack off.\nWherever you are right now, make the most of it. If you are not putting in the effort because you think this job is only temporary, you are not giving yourself or anyone else your best. This will only hurt your growth in the end. It\u2019ll be harder to get good references and you\u2019ll get into the habit of putting it the least amount of effort, so that if you end up getting your dream job, you may not perform as well as you could have, so used to slacking off you\u2019ll be.\u201cI\u2019m not enough\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not smart enough, skinny enough, fast enough, just not enough.\u201d Stop this right now! If you have a job, obviously someone thought you were the person for it. Comparing yourself to co-workers is not good for anyone. I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but you truly do have talents that not everyone has. Is it your quirky optimism? Your ability to stay on task? Your charisma that rallies the troops? Figure out what you have to bring to your work environment and bring it.\u201cSomeone else will do it\u201d\nSometimes we put off offering a hand or taking on tasks at work because we think someone else will do it. I do not know who this \u201csomeone else\u201d is, but it could always be you. If you see something that needs to be changed or someone that could use some help, why not pitch in? You may end up standing out for it. Be known for being helpful.\u201cIt\u2019s too risky\u201d\nSuccess takes risks. If we are always afraid of making a wrong move, we will hold our creativity back and never step forward. The fear of speaking up in a meeting, sharing an idea to improve that marketing campaign, or confronting a coworker about behavior that makes you uncomfortable. Your best work depends on your willingness to take calculated risks and go for the gold. The result can be a better environment for all.\n218SHARES\nShare\u00a0With\u00a0FriendsTweet\u00a0This!\u00a0\nlikethis\nPosted In\nLifestyle\nTags\nself-talk, success, success at work, things that hold us back, things we say, words, work\nself-talk, success, success at work, things that hold us back, things we say, words, work\nAbout The AuthorLori Hil\nLori Hil is an Enthused Freelance Writer & 9-5 Avoider.
