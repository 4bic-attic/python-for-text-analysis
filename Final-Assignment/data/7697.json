AFP TOKYO \u2014 Japanese lawmakers scuffled on Thursday during a heated debate over a security bill that could see the military fight abroad for the first time in decades, after thousands rallied to voice their anger. In scenes uncommon for Japan\u2019s normally sedate parliament, members of the opposition and the ruling coalition pushed and shoved each other as a committee chairman was surrounded. Opposition lawmaker Tetsuro Fukuyama later made an emotional speech outlining why his party had submitted a motion to delay the bills, which could see Japanese troops fight abroad for the first time since World War II. \u201cIs the ruling party listening to the voices of the public? You can do whatever you want to do because you have a majority\u2014is that what you think?\u201d he said, on the verge of tears. Tensions were running high after the committee vote was repeatedly delayed through Wednesday night, as opposition lawmakers blocked doorways and packed the corridors of parliament in protest. A total of 13 people were also reportedly arrested during the evening for \u201cinterfering with officers\u201d during a rally that saw an estimated 13,000 people gather outside parliament in Tokyo. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to vent their anger during almost daily rallies over the past weeks, a show of public feeling on a scale rarely seen in Japan. Under the planned changes, the Self-Defense Forces would have the option of going into battle to protect allies such as the United States even if there was no direct threat to Japan itself or its people. Although the constitution, which bars troops from taking part in combat except in pure self-defense, was imposed by US occupiers, many Japanese feel strongly any change in the law would alter the country\u2019s pacifist character. More protesters braved wet weather on Thursday, gathering outside parliament in plastic raincoats waving their umbrellas and shouting \u201cstop the bills\u201d as the committee debate rumbled on inside. Some held up pictures of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with a Hitler haircut and mustache. The bills are scheduled to be sent to a plenary session of the upper house after being voted on by the committee, potentially seeing them become law this week. Abe is keen to get the bills passed before a three-day holiday next week. The proposed legislation sailed through the lower house\u2014where Abe\u2019s coalition commands a two-thirds majority\u2014in July. Parliamentary rules say if the upper chamber does not pass the bills within 60 days, they can be returned to the lower house and voted into law. Abe is reportedly ready to take this step, despite the risk of further angering an already-hostile public. There are growing signs the bills have taken a toll on Abe\u2019s once high popularity. Opinion polls also show most voters oppose them. Many legal scholars have said the changes are unconstitutional, and critics worry they would drag Japan into American wars in far-flung parts of the globe. Abe and his supporters say the bills are necessary to deal with a changing security environment marked by an increasingly assertive China and unpredictable North Korea. \u00a9 2015 AFP Tweet Back to top Login to leave a comment Facebook users Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.
