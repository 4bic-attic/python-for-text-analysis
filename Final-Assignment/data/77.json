We have to make sure we win and not drop out of the promotion pack.\u201d \n \nSpenny will be without Glen Taylor (toe), Danny Frost (foot) and Michael Hogganson (appendicitis). \n \nPriestley Keithley has joined on non-contract terms from Middlesbrough and, though frustrated by injuries in his forward ranks, Ainsley is delighted by the form of strikers Liam Henderson and Nathan Fisher. \n \nHe added: \u201cWe have not had much continuity because of the injuries. \n \n\u201cFrosty has only played 18 minutes of the first game and Glen injured his toe at home but their (Henderson and Fisher\u2019s) workrate and commitment have been excellent and they will probably start against Clitheroe.\u201d", "source": "Newcastle Evening Chronicle"}
