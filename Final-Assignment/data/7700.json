All opinions are mine alone. \n \n\n \nSchool has been back in session for over three weeks for our family, and I\u2019m feeling the stretch and lack of time. \u00a0Soccer starts this week and we are coaching, so we need meals that are lightning speed fast. We get home and leave for practice in ninety minutes. This means we have to have the food prepared, on the table, and cleaned up in that time. \u00a0We are always looking for healthy meals that can be made quickly. This is why I love\u00a0 Walmart\u2019s Effortless Meals . #EffortlessMeals #CollectiveBias \n \n\n \nWe\u2019re going to show you how to use their \u201cready cooked\u201d Rotisserie Chicken to make Chicken BBQ sandwiches in less than 15 minutes. \u00a0We chose to pair it with one of their many sides, and we love macaroni salad. \n \n\n \nWhile we are going to show you how to make easy Chicken BBQ, you can also snag a Pizza Effortless Meal as well! \n \n\n \nWe also need a little extra zing for practice, and a 2 liter Coke or Sprite does the trick every time! \n \n\n \nYou can always get a sandwich meal too! \n \n\n \nOnce we brought the meal home, I removed the meat from the chicken and place in my mixing bowl to shred. Once it was shredded I simply added my favorite BBQ sauce and about 1/3 C of grade jelly. Blend with a fork until all the ingredients are mixed. \u00a0Place on a roll and add your side and your meal is ready. \n \n\u00a0This face says it all. We were out the door in time for practice, and while the food was fast, it wasn\u2019t fast food. \n \n\n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhat is your favorite quick meal?
