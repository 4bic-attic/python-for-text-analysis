(Photo : Video still from \"Duran Duran Performs 'Pressure Off' with Janelle Mon\u00e1e & Nile Rodgers\" via Ellen Tube) \nThree eras of dance music came together on The Ellen DeGeneres Show \u00a0as Janelle Monae \u00a0 and \u00a0 Nile Rodgers \u00a0 helped usher in Duran Duran's \u00a0collaborative single \"Pressure Off\" \u00a0from the band's new album Paper Gods . \u00a0 \n\n\nLike Us on Facebook  \n \nMonae and Rodgers are featured on the recording, which is the new wave band's first album in five years. \n\n \nDuran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon \u00a0and the always stylish and exceedingly talented Monae started amongst the crowd singing the song's opening lines before joining the rest of the band and Chic \u00a0guitarist Rodgers on the floor. \n\n \nThe tune is a bouncy new wave dance tune like only Duran Duran can create. The funk guitar from Rodgers brings a distinct Daft Punk \u00a0feel to the song as Monae danced, harmonized and provided the tune's vocal climax with a massive high note. \n\n \nThe mini super group has obviously become close over the course of the recording as Monae jumped into Le Bon's arms for a sweet moment at the end of the video as the applause came in following the final note. \n\n \nDespite a number of pre-released singles and a big media push from the band, Duran Duran has not seen the big commercial come back they might have been looking for from this album. The songs are catchy and take full advantage of the cultural embrace of EDM and house music in our daily music consumption. Paper Gods \u00a0has spent a week at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 \u00a0so far and only time can tell if they'll ascend to the heights they're hoping to reach. \n\n \nCertainly this performance can bring together dance and new wave fans of all generations as this eclectic group gives us a performance you won't want to miss. \n\n \nWatch the group perform \"Pressure Off\" on Ellen below and visit Duran Duran's website for tour dates.", "source": "Music Times"}
