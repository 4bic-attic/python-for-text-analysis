Kanye West sends new BFF Taylor Swift a giant bouquet of flowers", "id": "bac43c9c-3ae8-4c1e-9a26-7d9b69be391e", "content": "Kanye West and Taylor Swift have well and truly buried the hatchet after he sent her a giant bouquet of flowers. \nWest famously interrupted Swift's 2009 VMA Best Video Award acceptance speech by claiming Beyonce should have won the award. \n\nBut it seems like the pair have kissed and made up and are now each other's new BFFs. \nAt last week's VMAs she presented West with the Video Vanguard Award and instead of performing, he used the time to have a chat instead to announce (or warn) of his intention to run for President in 2020. Yes, really. \n\nIt seems he has a new running mate too, with Swift's hashtag on the Instagram picture #kantay2020 suggesting she would be up for attempting to run America alongside her former enemy. \n\nSwift also recently patched up her feud with Nicki Minaj with an epic duet at the VMAs .", "source": "Digital Spy"}
