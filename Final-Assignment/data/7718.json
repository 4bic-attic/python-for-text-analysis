More range! So that's what Nissan is giving them in the 2016 Leaf. Unfortunately, the stronger battery increases the price of the EV, which has seen demand fade with falling gas prices\u2014sales are off 35 percent through August.-\nSV and SL versions of the 2016 Leaf receive the battery upgrade, going from a 24-kWh unit to one with 30 kWh of capacity. The more robust battery increases the EPA-rated driving range from 84 to 107 miles, which is tops among compact EVs.-\n-\nThe extra miles don't come free, however. The Leaf SV sees its MSRP increase by $2100 to $35,050 (before $7500 federal tax credit), while the SL climbs by $1670 to $37,640 (again, without the $7500 rebate from Uncle Sam).-\nThe base model, the Leaf S, has no price increase for 2016\u2014staying at $29,860 before credits\u2014but it doesn't get the new battery either. It keeps the existing 24-kWh unit and continues to be rated at 84 miles of emissions-free driving.-\n---Leaf Glower: Nissan Coats Its Oddball EV with New Glow-in-the-Dark Paint [w/Video]-Nissan Leaf + Nissan Frontier = World's Only Zero-Emissions Leafamino-Nissan Leaf Reviews, News, Pricing, Tests, and More---\nIn non-battery news, the Leaf is also treated to connectivity upgrades.
