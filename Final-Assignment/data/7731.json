(Photo:  / iStockphoto) \n\nI got to be a good Samaritan a couple weeks ago. \n\nSort of. \n\nActually, that might be a stretch. I wasn\u2019t much help at all. Does it count if I made the effort? \n\nI was carrying groceries into the house when a voice called from behind, \u201cExcuse me, sir! Excuse me!\u201d \n\nI looked over my shoulder and saw a woman hustling down a driveway just two houses away. She waved her arms overhead, desperate for my attention. \n\n\u201cCan you help me jump-start my van, please?\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cNo problem.\u201d \n\nI carried the last of the groceries into the house and set them on the floor. \u201cBe right back,\u201d I told my wife, Amanda. \u201cSomeone needs a jump-start.\u201d \n\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Amanda said with a wink. \n\nBy the time I backed out of my driveway, I could see the van easing down its own steep driveway in neutral. The hood was already open. \n\nI pulled my car as close as I could, then stepped out. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got jumper cables,\u201d the lady said as she exited the vehicle and hurried to the trunk. \n\n\u201cOK,\u201d I said, popping my own car\u2019s hood. \n\nShe was back in just a few seconds. \u201cThank you so much for helping me,\u201d she said, handing me the cables. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my daughter-in-law to work, and this is the only vehicle we\u2019ve got.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s no trouble,\u201d I assured her. I attached the cables to my battery, then moved to hers. \u201cThis is just a lazy Saturday afternoon for me.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she went on. \u201cIt worked fine all week. It worked fine getting me here. And now it won\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, cars do that,\u201d I said. \u201cA lot.\u201d \n\nOne of the van\u2019s battery cables was badly corroded, I noticed. It looked like it could fall off at any time. I had a nagging feeling that would be a problem. \n\nI did my best to keep from moving it while connecting the jumper cables, then headed back to my car and turned the ignition. It revved and came to life, as it always did. \n\nI just hoped the lady\u2019s van would do the same. \n\n\u201cI just have to get this thing working,\u201d she told me. \u201cI have to work Monday morning.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, maybe this\u2019ll do the trick,\u201d I assured her. \n\nIt didn\u2019t. \n\nFive minutes later, she tried the van\u2019s ignition. It clicked, but nothing more. \n\nAfter another five minutes, the same thing happened. \n\nWe swapped her jumper cables for mine, but we had the same result. \n\nAround this time, the daughter-in-law joined us. \u201cAny luck?\u201d she asked. \n\nI sighed and shook my head. \n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d the lady said. \u201cI can\u2019t make you late for work.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s OK,\u201d the daughter-in-law assured me. \u201cI\u2019ve already called ahead and got it covered.\u201d \n\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be more help.\u201d \n\nAnd so, with my tail planted firmly between my legs, I returned my jumper cables to the car and drove home. \n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. \n\nAmanda and I were watching television the next day, and I was just about to doze off when there was a hard knock on the door. \n\nI opened it and saw the lady again, dressed in her Sunday best. She was smiling. It was the sort of disarming, apologetic smile that says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to do this again, but here we are.\u201d \n\n\u201cWould you mind jump-starting my van again?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy nephew\u2019s here, and he\u2019s going to help with the battery.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d I said, giving in to that infectious smile. \n\nSo I pulled up to her van again and retrieved my jumper cables. From there, the nephew did all the work. \n\nSeriously, all of it. \n\nThrough some exhaustive means of trial and error, he determined the battery cable was indeed the problem. \n\nBut unlike me, he had a solution. \n\nHe wedged a piece of metal into the connection, allowing the current to travel to the battery. Then, he called on me to start my car. \n\nWhich I did. \n\nFive minutes later, he tried the van\u2019s ignition. It revved for a second, then died. \n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d the lady moaned. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry just yet,\u201d the nephew said. \u201cSometimes it can take a while.\u201d \n\nHe tried again after another five minutes. Same result. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nThen, the ignition turned over, and the van came to life. \n\n\u201cOh, thank you, Lord!\u201d the lady cried and started dancing. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile at that. \n\nThe nephew stepped out and offered me his hand while I removed the jumper cables. \u201cThanks, man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really appreciate it.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I told him, shaking his hand, \u201cyou did all the work.\u201d \n\nThe nephew definitely gets the good Samaritan title here, but maybe I can claim an assist. At least I wasn\u2019t the priest or the Levite, right? \n\nMatt Schorr can be reached at his website, www.MattSchorr.net , by email at mattschorr@hotmail.com or via Twitter @themattschorr. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://leafne.ws/1EJ4faK", "source": "Leaf Chronicle"}
