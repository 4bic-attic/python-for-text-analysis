Either that or you just don\u2019t understand the problem. \n \n(A further issue is that photorealistic graphics tend to require increasingly expensive hardware \u2013 I know a lot of the writers here have \u00a31200 quid+ computers, sometimes a lot more expensive than that, which absolutely makes sense for a game reviewer, but my main objection to the pursuit of these graphics, myself, is that they lead to games demanding more and more expensive hardware \u2013 we actually caught a break from that for a while, when non-photorealistic graphics were forced \u201cinto style\u201d by the declining power of consoles compared to PCs, but it seems like the whole race has heated up again \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll cool in a year or three as the consoles hit their maximum capability, but not before I\u2019ve had to not buy games because I don\u2019t have the \u00a3170+ quid graphics card and \u00a3700+ PC you need to run those games at 30fps on settings which don\u2019t look like grey mud.", "source": "Comments for Rock, Paper, Shotgun - PC Game Reviews, Previews, Subjectivity"}
