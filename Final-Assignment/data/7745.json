The trip was a failure. Not only did his brother\u2019s condition continue to deteriorate, but Washington contracted smallpox. Although he survived \u2014 and only half of those with the disease were so lucky \u2014 it was not without long-term ramifications. He showed the telltale signs of the disease: pockmarks on his forehead and nose and a prolonged fever that likely made him sterile. \n \nAt 27, Washington married Martha Custis, a widow who had already given birth to two young healthy children \u2014 Jacky and Patsy. Thus, Washington\u2019s lack of offspring cannot be laid at Martha's feet. Washington was a loving stepfather to the young children he\u2019d inherited with his marriage. Unfortunately, both children met early, tragic ends. \n \nPatsy died in his arms in an epileptic fit before the Revolution. The day after her death, Washington wrote to his brother-in-law, \u201cIt is an easier matter to concede than to describe the distress of this family, especially that of the unhappy parent of our dear Patsy Custis, when I inform you that yesterday removed the sweet, innocent girl into a more happy and peaceful abode than any she has met in the afflicted path she hithered to as trod.\u201d \n \nJacky was a dandy who did not fight in the war. With Martha\u2019s encouragement, Washington brought Jacky with him to the siege at Yorktown that ended the War. Jacky, who was inexperienced in unsanitary camp life, promptly caught cholera and died at age 26.\u00a0 \n \nBy the time the Revolution ended, the \u201cfather of our country\u201d was father to no one. In a draft of Washington\u2019s first inaugural address, he wrote: \u201cDivine providence hath not seen fit that my blood should be transmitted, or my name perpetuated by the enduring, though sometimes seducing, channel of immediate offspring. I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision \u2014 no family to build in greatness upon my country\u2019s ruins.\u201d \n \nAs Yoch notes,\u00a0\u201cThis may have been a fortunate happenstance, as many called for him to be America\u2019s new king. His lack of children allowed him to truly act in the country\u2019s best interests and sealed his legacy as 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.'\u201d \n \nTo learn more about George Washington in his early years, including his trip to Barbados, visit www.becominggeorgewashington.com.", "source": "The Shippensburg News-Chronicle"}
