Beginning in 2016, the enthusiastic and curious are in for more intense weekends thanks to the agreement between Renault Sport and the European Le Mans Series. \n \nActivities for all ages as well as spectacular and varied races will be part of the programme. The Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 will represent the single-seaters, the Renault Sport Trophy for the GTS and the European Le Mans Series for Endurance. While they will share the bill at five meetings in 2016, each category will retain its identity and its specificities. \n \nLaunched this season, the Renault Sport Trophy has already established itself as a new reference among feeder series' towards the professional championships thanks to its extraordinary performance level and its ultra-competitiveness. \n \nAn essential cornerstone of the Renault Sport strategy, the Formula Renault 2.0, which celebrates its 45th anniversary this year, has been the break out category for many future champions such as Alain Prost, Kimi R\u00c3\u00a4ikk\u00c3\u00b6nen, Lewis Hamilton, Felipe Massa, Valtteri Bottas, Romain Grosjean, Daniil Kvyat, Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz. \n \nThe three International Formula Renault 2.0 series' will reinforce their cooperation. The Eurocup, ALPS and NEC are working on complementary calendars to avoid date conflicts and allow drivers who have double programmes to accumulate the necessary points to validate their FIA super-license. The three categories will have a minimum seven events organized at Europe's finest circuits, like Pau for the ALPS or Silverstone for the NEC. And for the first time in its long and rich history, the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 will be the curtain raiser for the Monaco F1 Grand Prix. \n \nJean-Pascal Dauce, Renault Sport Technologies Director of Motorsport: \n \n\"During a period of reconstruction for the feeder series', we are thrilled to have concluded this agreement with the ELMS to organize our championships. After having collaborated by their side at several meetings the past two years, it was wise to take the plunge to offer varied events in as much for the spectators as for our competitors. This partnership will also offer a quality setting to the Formula Renault 2.0 and Renault Sport Trophy drivers in proposing race meetings at legendary circuits, including a number of F1 venues. A very good school for the young drivers who hope to reach motor racing's most prestigious category.\" \n \nGerard Neveu, European Le Mans Series CEO said: \n \n\"We are very happy to welcome the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 and Renault Sport Trophy which are joining us at the majority of the 2016 ELMS calendar and our thanks go to Renault Sport Technologies for their full support. The addition of these two high profile single seater and GT race series will enhance the popularity of the ELMS weekends. \n \nFormula Renault 2.0 has produced some great champions since the series began, including Porsche's\r\n\t\t\tBrendon Hartley and Audi's Filipe Albuquerque, both ELMS race winners. The new Renault Sport Trophy with the new RS01 is going to be an exciting new championship and will provide another route for drivers interested in GT racing. The combination of ELMS, Formula Renault and the Renault Sport Trophy will give the fans more reasons to join us for an exciting 2016 season.\" \n \nProvisional 2016 Calendar*: \n \n16/17 April 2016: Motorland Arag\u00c3\u00b3n (Renault Sport Trophy, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0) \n \n14/15 May 2016: Imola (Renault Sport Trophy, ELMS) \n \n29 May 2016: Monaco (Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0) \n \n16/17 July 2016: Red Bull Ring (Renault Sport Trophy, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, ELMS) \n \n27/28 August 2016: Circuit Paul Ricard (Renault Sport Trophy, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, ELMS) \n \n24/25 September 2016**: Spa-Francorchamps (Renault Sport Trophy, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, ELMS) \n \n22/23 October 2016: Estoril (Renault Sport Trophy, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, ELMS) \n \n*Subject to FIA approval, additional dates will be announced soon \n \n**Subjet to confirmation \n \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION: \n \nRENAULT PRESS CONTACT: +33 1 76 84 63 36 \n \nWebsites: www.media.renault.com - www.group.renault.com \n \nPRESS CONTACT RENAULT SPORT TECHNOLOGIES \n \nMarie-Hel\u00c3\u00a8ne de Rabaudy \n \nMobile : +33 622 571 901 \n \nmarie-helene.de-rabaudy@renault.com \n \nrenaultsport.com \n \nmedia.renaultsport.com \n \n.", "source": "Bloomberg"}
