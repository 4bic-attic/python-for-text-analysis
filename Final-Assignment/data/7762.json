U.S. firms are now allowed to send supplies to private Cuban businesses and export telephones, computers and Internet technology. \n \nStill, efforts by U.S. businesses to expand trade and tourism have encountered bureaucratic hurdles in both countries that have hindered growth. \n \nCredit card companies still cannot transfer payments to Cuba and telecommunications firms have not been able to get equipment to the island, which is 90 miles south of Florida. Meanwhile, Cuba's government does not run its Internet connection anywhere near capacity levels. \n \nThe Treasury and Commerce departments recently announced updated regulations aimed at easing procedures for U.S. citizens who want to travel or do business in Cuba. The former Cold War foes are expected to resume direct postal service by the end of the year. \n \nThe new council said it will also urge the Cuban government to make policy changes that lessen control over Cuban businesses. Cubans frequently complain about the rigidity of their country's system and have also expressed growing concern about inequality.", "source": "Minneapolis Star Tribune"}
