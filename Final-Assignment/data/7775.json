The event \n      features a mixture of presentations and panel sessions with top speakers \n      from broadcast, telecoms, media and content, offering a high-end \n      editorially led programme together with strategic networking \n      opportunities. \n\nParticular highlights to capture the interest and imagination will \n      include unique insights into: The Future of OTT and Online Offerings \n      in the Region and Beyond: With  OTT and online TV offerings \n      becoming such a core way for consumers to view media, it is essential \n      that media distributors stay ahead of the game. This panel session will \n      consider the impact of new entrants and consolidation within the \n      region\u2019s OTT market, together with the possible negative effect of \n      content packaging constraints on consumer subscription levels. Further \n      deliberations will involve how to engage and retain new audiences \n      through the use of social media, the influence of traditional broadcast \n      companies on the OTT space and the necessity of OTT collaborations with \n      telcos. \n\n Content is King: Strategies to stay ahead in an increasingly \n      competitive content environment: As consumers are increasingly \n      calling the shots, it has never been more important to ensure the right \n      content is delivered, irrespective of the platform. Content is the key \n      asset in every media business, wherever you sit in the value chain and \n      this session will address the issues in developing an effective strategy \n      whether it\u2019s fighting for commissioning rights, creating original \n      content or looking to digital-original content creators. With the \n      increasing popularity of online gaming channels, the panel will also \n      consider whether there are there lessons to be learned from the \n      difference in content and multiplatform delivery. \n\n How are Disruptive Tech Start-ups and Media Companies Using Each \n      Other\u2019s Platforms to Create Their Own Success? Buzzfeed is very open \n      about the major role that exploiting social media platforms such as \n      Twitter has played in their success - and this is not an unusual story. \n      With new media players and tech start-ups constantly appearing across \n      the world, this session will look at the ways in which these companies \n      are using social platforms to grow their image, how to create and \n      implement a strategy across multiple platforms and the best methods to \n      engage and attract audiences. \n\nAmong the influential contributors to these debates are: \n\n Martin Trickey, Group Head of Digital, Warner Bros.
