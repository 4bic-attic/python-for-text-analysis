Millions of people are being forced to risk their lives in a desperate search for safety as conflicts rage around the world,\u201d Webster said. \n \n\r\n\tTo donate, go to: www.redcross.org.uk/refugeecrisis \n \n\r\n\tAre you organising and event to help?\u00a0 \n \n\r\n\tIf so let us know by e-mailing matt.jones@nwn.co.uk\u00a0", "source": "North Wales Pioneer"}
