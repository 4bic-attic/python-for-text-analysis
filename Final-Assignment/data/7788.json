Sounds like the perfect Cape Town happy hour spot, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nFor snacks and nibbles, you can choose triple cheese chilli poppers, pulled pork tacos, crumbed mushrooms and salmon crostini (the average price is around R40 for two during the glorious deal), and as for drinks, the beers \u2013 think Grolsch, Heineken, Jack Black draughts, Lumber Jack Ale and CBC Amber Weiss amongst others -\u00a0 and cocktails, like cosmos, margaritas, \u00a0bloody marys, mojitos and daiquiris- all go for half the already reasonable price that you see on the menu (just order a pair to take advantage). \n\nAnd since we\u2019re convinced that your appetite will be significantly whetted, we\u2019ll give you the lowdown on the food items that the haunt is most famous for: its burgers (in case you didn\u2019t know already). There are about 20 creations, like The Original Royale, which comprises bacon, cheddar, chilli and battered onion rings; The Boss, which is stacked with a mozzarella-stuffed beef patty topped with BBQ beef rib meat and dill pickles; The Vanilla Thunder, which comes in the form of a grilled chicken breast topped with crumbed mushrooms, blue cheese and rocket; and The Wiseguy, which is layered with tomato relish, fresh chillies, jalape\u00f1os and rocket. Not to mention, the ingredients are, where possible, gathered from suppliers in and around Cape Town. Do note that the burgers do not fall under the 2-for-1 deal and that ostrich or veg patties can be substituted for ground beef. \n \nFact 3 : Your week just got a whole better. \n\nDetails for Hudsons\u2019s Happy Hour Food & Drinks Special \n \nThe burger joint\u2019s happy hour special, which runs at all three of its outlets, is valid from 4:30pm \u2013 6:30pm every weekday.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2-for-1 deal applies only to the appetisers, beers and cocktails.\u00a0 Bookings aren\u2019t essential. \n \n--- \n \nEager to read more about this burger hotspot?
