Here are some of the photos I took. First of all, the moon at around 10.30pm Sunday (before anything had started): \n \nNow, the moon at about 1.20-am Monday morning. There was a hint of something in the top left, though it isn\u2019t easily seen in the photo: \n \nThis next one is at around 1.40am. Definitely something happening now but still not easily discernible on the photo: \n \nNow, the appearance at about 2.10am Monday. Absolutely no mistaking it now: \n \nThis one is from around 2.30am: \n \nThis is at 2.55am. I\u2019d left it a bit long and it had progressed further than I expected: \n \nI noticed that although the reddish tinge was visible to the naked eye, I was focusing on the lit part of the moon so was getting quite a fast exposure \u2013 meaning that the red part wasn\u2019t showing up. This next image is from the same time (2.55am), but with my focus on the darker part. The lit part is over-exposed slightly as a result: \n \nBy now, it had almost reached totality and over-exposure wasn\u2019t as much of a problem. This is from around 3.15am. \n \nHere\u2019s another from the same time, with the focus shifted slightly: \n \nAnd finally around 3.40am. I couldn\u2019t saty up any longer as I had to go to work in the morning (note that exposure time was so long you can even see a couple of stars just to the right): \n \nAnd another different exposure from the same time: \n \nIf I ever do anything like this again, I\u2019ll check to make sure forecast times are in BST and not GMT \u2013 everything was an hour later than I\u2019d expected!", "source": "Diary Of An ADI"}
