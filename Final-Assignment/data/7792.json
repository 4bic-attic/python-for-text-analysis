Now the highly touted lefty prospect is back from the disabled list and expected to start this weekend in Miami, and the Mets are just hoping to get him and their core of young arms to the playoffs healthy and without upsetting the team\u2019s momentum. \n\nWhile the team refused to say when Matz will make his third major-league start, it will likely be Sunday, since he is scheduled to throw his bullpen session on Wednesday afternoon and a lighter session on Friday. \n\n\u201cSometime soon,\u201d was all Terry Collins would say when pressed on when Matz would return to a major-league mound. \n\n\u201cThey just said keep on doing your work and they\u2019ll let me know,\u201d said Matz, who went on the DL with a partially torn lat on July 10. \n\nThe Mets plan to use Matz to help manage the workload of their other starters down the stretch as they go into a six-man group after this turn through the rotation. That is a tentative plan, one team source emphasized. With the six-man rotation having been a sore point with some of the young hurlers, the team is going to be very sensitive to how the pitchers respond. \n\n\u201cThe idea here is to win,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou think we are going to stick with a six-man if things get close down the stretch? I think you will see that change.\u201d \n\nNoah Syndergaard will be skipped from his next scheduled start in Miami to try to keep his innings under control. With a day off on Thursday, the Mets could use Bartolo Colon on regular rest in Syndergaard\u2019s spot, a team source suggested. \n\n YOUNG AGAIN \n\nAfter appearing in only 35 games with Atlanta earlier this season, Eric Young Jr. said he\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d to be back with the first-place Mets, even if his role is little more than a pinch-runner late in games. \n\nYoung, one of seven Sept. 1 additions to the major-league roster, had 76 stolen bases over the previous two seasons, mostly with the Mets. \u201cSpending the last two seasons with these guys and seeing the success they\u2019ve been able to have, to get the call to come back and be a part of that, I\u2019m excited for whatever role they present to me,\u201d Young said. . . . The Mets also recalled catcher Kevin Plawecki and infielder Eric Campbell from Triple-A Las Vegas; they returned outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis, Matz and reliever Erik Goeddel from their rehab assignments and reinstated them from the disabled list. RHP Vic Black was outrighted to Las Vegas.\u00a0", "source": "LocalNews7.com"}
