This will take a lot of burden off the federation,\u201d disclosed Pinnick. \n \n\u201cThe bank has also sponsored the country\u2019s top referees for refresher courses in London.\u201d \n \nCash-strapped NFF have often struggled to pay the country\u2019s coaches as at when due with previous coach Stephen Keshi owed for several months before he was eventually paid.", "source": "People Daily"}
