Nevertheless, here we have it, allowing you to customize your own look and drape either the 1, 90, or 95 model runners from from heel to toe in a handful of bold colorways. The new option also includes the ability to continue to select every material used in its construction, adding another level of uniqueness to your look through texture and blend. Available now, hit the NIKEiD site to play around with your own new look. The post NIKEiD Adds Tonal Options to the Nike Air Max Range appeared first on Freshness Mag.", "source": "Gods Of Rap"}
