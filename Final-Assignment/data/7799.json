He criticized Republican and Democratic detractors, promised strong leadership and boasted of how well his campaign has performed so far. As usual, he was short on policy specifics. \n\nThe event served as one of Trump\u2019s final warm-ups for the\u00a0second Republican debate Wednesday night. Trump will be positioned at center stage once again, a reflection of polls that show him holding a clear lead over the rest of the field. \n\n\u201cI hear they are all going after me,\u201d Trump said of his competitors. \u201cWhatever.\u201d \n\nThe rally, which was held at the American Airlines Center, where professional basketball and hockey teams play, attracted a large and energized crowd. But many of the upper-level seats were empty, raising questions about exactly how many ticketholders showed up. All of the roughly 20,000 tickets organizers distributed for free were scooped up by the end of last week. Some who landed tickets sought to sell them online for hundreds of dollars. \n\n\u201cCan you people see me up there?\u201d Trump said, highlighting the size of both the crowd and the venue. He appeared to try to explain the empty seats with a joke: \u201cI said to them, don\u2019t fill up the upper rings. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d \n\nTrump, whose immigration plans have drawn intense criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, also attracted protesters who marched toward the arena carrying anti-Trump signs. \n\n\u201cWhat do we want? Dump Trump!\u201d they chanted. \n\nTrump enthusiasts started lining up at noon outside the arena, some driving considerable distances. Some said they were not at all sure they would vote for him but sure didn\u2019t want to miss a chance to see him in person. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s entertaining!\u201d said Paul\u00adine Pitman, 73, a retired county government employee, \u201cI like his business sense.\u201d But she said she would need more convincing to vote him president. \n\nSome Trump supporters decided to make a buck \u2014 and thought Trump would approve of it. \n\nSelling \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hats, visors, T-shirts and buttons, small-time entrepreneurs decided to cash in on the enthusiasm for the unconventional candidate. \n\n\u201cI am sure I will sell out!\u201d said Janet Newlon, 67, an office manager for a Chattanooga HVAC company who drove 11 hours to see Trump. And while there, she had a few dozen $21 Trump hats, and they were going fast. \n\nTrump singled out a long list of foes in his remarks, including Republican strategist Karl Rove, Washington Post columnist George Will, the media in general, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. \n\nHe said that his surprisingly strong showing in the polls will mean nothing if he does not prevail when voters cast their ballots. \n\n\u201cUnless I win, it\u2019s a been a waste of time for me,\u201d he said. \n\nOn Tuesday, Trump plans to be in Los Angeles, where he will host a national security event aboard the USS Iowa battleship. \n\nHe said he liked many of his Republican opponents including Ted Cruz, whom he called \u201ca good guy.\u201d But he warned against aggressively criticizing him. \n\n\u201cIf he comes out and attacks me on Wednesday night, I will take it back immediately,\u201d said Trump. \n\n Sullivan reported from Washington.", "source": "Mount Olive Tribune"}
