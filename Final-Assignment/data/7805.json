The main culprit is the weak manufacturing data from China that was released when U.S. stock markets were closed. Mix in a weak close with a bunch of nervous nellies and the end result is approximately a 300 point loss at time of writing. \n\nIn addition, the USA Manufacturing PMI for August came in lower than expected (51.10 vs. 52.60 estimates), while the prior reading came in at 52.70. \n\nThat news snuffed out a rally off the open that retraced almost half of the S&P 500 indexes losses when it peaked at 1939.50. The ensuing decline found support at 1921.50 and the rebound has found intra-day resistance at 1930.75. \n\nThe index has not even come close to its pre-market low of 1914.00. \n\nAll of the top 10 components in the index are in the red. Leading the way on the downside is Exxon Mobil Corporation\u00a0 (NYSE: XOM ) shares, which is following Crude Oil lower as it off by $3 at $72.24. It is followed by JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ) shares which are trading lower by $2 at $62.10. \n\nSee more from Benzinga \n\n\u00a9 2015 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.
