(http://www.marketintelligencecenter.com/symbol/ALK\"ALK) is a good candidate for a covered call at the $72.50 level. The Jan. '16 call at that price should fetch a credit of about $7.60, which means the entire position has a net debit of about $67.20. This trade has 8.02% downside protection. Another option would be to buy the ALK Jan. '17 $40.00 call instead of holding a long position in the stock. This lowers the net debit to $28.80, but the position only has 8.02% downside protection. Technical indicators for the stock are bullish and Alaska Air Group has a 52-week low of $40.69 and 52-week high of $82.15.", "source": "Individual.com"}
