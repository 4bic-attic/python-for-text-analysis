Syndicate Bank gained 3.5 per cent, while Canara Bank and Karnataka Bank added 2.5 per cent each. \n\nAfter the status quo on rate hike by the US Fed, investors are now eyeing Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) forthcoming policy meet scheduled for September 29, hoping that RBI governor Raghuram Rajan will please the Street with another repo rate cut. \n\nAt the end of the two-day FOMC meeting that ended on September 17, the US Fed announced its decision to leave the rates unchanged at 0-0.25 per cent, keeping the rates unchanged for the seventh year or 55th straight FOMC meeting. \n\n\"I don't think RBI will be in a big hurry. If you look at the last two inflation readings, they have undershot the revised trajectory that RBI had put out in its previous policy document. So given that RBI is an inflation targeter, a 30-35 bps undershoot to its trajectory should open up room for a 25 bps cut. But I will be surprised if it does more than that, given the fact that it continues to see inflation going down towards five,\" said Suyash Choudhary of IDFC MF.", "source": "Economic Times"}
