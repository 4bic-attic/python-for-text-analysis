IHCC built a three-goal lead heading into the second half, but needed a goal by Rilee Miller in the 66th minute to blunt an attempted comeback by the Lakers. \n  \nVera Alla Flood put the Warriors ahead less than six minutes into the contest with the first IHCC goal of the day. Just over three minutes later, Olivia Pargeon added a sharp strike from just outside the box to give the Warriors a 2-0 lead in the ninth minute of the match. \n \nLexi Vaughn's free kick goal with under six minutes left in the first half put IHCC ahead 3-0, but a pair of Warrior penalties opened the door for a pair of goals by Iowa Lakes as Alex Mendez and Jessica Miller-Ulmer pulled the Lakers within 3-2 in the 58th minute. \n \nIHCC (3-1, 1-1) will be right back in regional action at home on Tuesday. The Warriors will take on Scott Community College at 4 p.m. \n \nThe Warrior men (1-5, 0-3) fell in a tough regional battle on Saturday to Iowa Lakes as a goal in the 30th minute by Edgar Guzman gave the Lakers a 1-0 win. The match featured plenty of physical play, which led to a pair of yellow cards, a red card ejection of IHCC's Christian Silva Correa De Lima, and a pair of bench-clearing altercations.", "source": "Ottumwa Courier"}
