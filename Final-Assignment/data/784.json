Abby Fisher (fourth, 19:29.17) led Billerica to the team title with 87 points. \n\nIn the Div.\u20091 boys race, Peabody\u2019s Marcelo Rocha and Tom D\u2019Anieri of Wellesley ran together early until Rocha surged and was clear by the mile. He continued picking up the pace and stayed just ahead of D\u2019Anieri for a fast 15:36.07 win. D\u2019Anieri never faltered and finished five seconds back in 15:41.18. Cambridge placed five runners in the top 20 for the 41-point win. \n\nRocha, one of the preseason favorites to capture the Div. 1 state title, tried to feel out the tough field. \n\n\u201cI was trying to go out and see where I am compared to last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt good. I still have a lot more work to do. Hopefully, if I\u2019m injury-free, I\u2019ll keep improving.\u201d \n\nIn Div.\u20092 boys, Newburyport\u2019s Jack Carleo ran alongside teammate Joseph Mulvar and Norton\u2019s Chris Wren through a controlled 5:05 first mile before surging ahead halfway through to take the lead for good. The junior was well clear of the field at 2 miles (10:14) and simply cruised the final mile for the win. Carleo was more than seven seconds in front of Molvar (16:29.20) at the finish. Wren finished a solid third with his 16:38.52. \n\n\u201cI made a move at the beginning of the second loop,\u201d Carleo said. \u201cI looked back a couple of times to see if there was anybody coming.\u201d \n\nMichael Weidenbruch finished seventh in 16:50.13 to lead Marblehead to the team title with 68 points, well ahead of Wakefield\u2019s 100 points and Newburyport\u2019s 117. \n\nSophomore Stephanie Casaletto of Austin Prep dueled with Ipswich standout Emily DeMarco at the halfway point before switching gears to break away to a 19:04.18 win in the Div. 2 girls event. Teammate Sarah Oliver clocked 19:12.29 for second and DeMarco claimed the bronze medal with her 19:24.18. \n\nCasaletto took DeMarco\u2019s move very seriously. \n\n\u201cEmily DeMarco is such a good runner, and she passed me,\u201d she said. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I just had a little bit more and went for it.\u201d \n\nOld Rochester was the team champion with 71 points, beating Westwood (107) and Newburyport (115).", "source": "Boston Herald"}
