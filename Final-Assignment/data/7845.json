This investment is paying off. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"Despite the perception that all graduates are job-hoppers, graduates stay with our employer members for an average of five years. What's more, only 6% leave in their first year on the job and just 11% leave before the end of two years.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "Eastbourne Herald"}
