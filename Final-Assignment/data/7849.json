Stop selling the fantasy of market-beating performance. Explain that your goal [in collaboration with the rest of the client\u2019s advisory team] is to help clients not just with investments, but their entire financial life. Tell clients that, while you might charge 1% a year, only a quarter or half of the fee is for investment management \u2014 and the rest is for everything else you do [emphasis added].\u201d \n \nClements is a brilliant and insightful reporter, but I would respectfully add an additional point to his analysis \u2013 \u201ccollaboration.\u201d \n \nBeautiful Planning Music \n \nThe model for a client planning team should be a symphony, with each advisor playing in harmony with the others, making beautiful planning music. \u00a0 \u00a0 But that, unfortunately, isn\u2019t the norm. \u00a0 Most advisors give lip service to the idea but far too few practice what they preach. \u00a0 But perhaps the robo advisor threat to financial advisers, the Turbo Tax threat to CPAs and the Legalzoom threat to attorneys will drive the point home. \u00a0 While many advisors dismiss all of this, doing so is a dangerous mistake. \u00a0 While wealthy sophisticated clients aren\u2019t going to prepare their own tax return using Turbo Tax, nor their own wills using Rocket Lawyer, and perhaps won\u2019t opt for a robo advisor, make no mistake that these trends affect even the wealthiest clients\u2019 view of what their various professionals are providing and billing. \n \nBeneficial Results \n \nThe best approach for all advisors: insurance, investment, accounting, law, etc. to provide value added is to collaborate as a team. \u00a0 When collaboration happens, the results for the clients are almost always obviously better and more efficient. \u00a0 But too often, this never happens because each advisor tries to protect her turf or, out of sheer arrogance, simply doesn\u2019t appreciate the benefits that involving other advisors can provide. \n \n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if a large wealth management firm or trust company has a deep bench of tax and estate planning talent, it often misses points that the client\u2019s CPA or attorney would identify. \u00a0 Even if the client\u2019s CPA is a local practitioner who doesn\u2019t have the expertise to address the complex planning the client has grown into, that CPA may have many decades of understanding of family relationships, business operations and other facts essential to the planning succeeding. \n \n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having the correct party execute the correct documents for a trust company, making the correct payments on a note sale, and properly exercising a swap power all are enhanced by collaboration of the wealth manager with the client\u2019s estate planning attorney. But, \u00a0 too often, that never happens as the wealth manager views matters as routine and within her expertise when the result confirms otherwise. \n \n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Few estate-planning attorneys can understand the complex nuances of the economics of insurance policies. \u00a0 Yet how many times will an estate-planning attorney review an insurance trust or plan without involving the client\u2019s insurance consultant? \u00a0 Insurance consultants commonly sell life insurance without insisting that the client involve her estate planner before the policy purchase is consummated. \u00a0 With clients often having many different trusts, can the agent really be certain which is appropriate to use to purchase a policy? \u00a0 And how many policies are sold to individuals when the obvious owner should be a trust. \u00a0 Is it reasonable for a wealth manager to discuss harvesting gains and losses without conferring with the client\u2019s CPA? \u00a0 Can a CPA really discuss year-end tax planning without input from the client\u2019s wealth manager? \n Get the Client Onboard  \nClients, even wealthy ones, remain fee conscious and will view collaboration as an incremental cost. \u00a0 The solutions are quite simple. \u00a0 Every advisor has to get out her silo and educate the client on the clear benefits of collaboration. \u00a0 Every advisor must insist that the client not only permit collaboration, but insist on it. \u00a0 Collaboration can often be achieved with modest additional cost. \u00a0 For the estate-planning attorney or wealth manager to circulate a letter or memorandum summarizing a client meeting to all of the client\u2019s advisors doesn\u2019t add appreciably to the cost. \u00a0 Conducting a phone or web conference without the client but with all advisors can be incredibly efficient. \u00a0 Without a physical meeting, the time and hence cost to the client, is minimized. \u00a0 Without the client being present, the advisors can speak freely and use technical jargon to quickly get to the planning point under consideration. \u00a0 Collaboration requires more than merely communication. \u00a0 Coordinated implementation of the discussions is what will really benefit the client. \n \nEvery profession is under pressure from internet options and automation, whether real or merely perceived. \u00a0 The answer is to offer better results and value added guidance for the client through collaboration, not to cut costs and provide lower quality advice and service. \u00a0 It\u2019s like mom always said, \u201ctwo heads are better than one.\u201d \u00a0 And for planning, three, four or more advisor heads are better than all the internet options. \n \nClient Authorization \n \nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve personally done and what I\u2019m planning to do. \u00a0 For many years, I\u2019ve had clients, as part of the engagement process, authorize me to communicate in my discretion with other advisors. \u00a0 I can\u2019t complete an estate plan without input from the other advisors. \u00a0 I\u2019ve endeavored when clients have authorized to circulate a letter or memorandum of a meeting to all of the client\u2019s advisors. \u00a0 That should really be the norm. \u00a0 I am going to give consideration to having clients sign a letter to all of their advisors authorizing and requesting that they communicate and collaborate with their other advisors.", "source": "WealthManagement.com"}
