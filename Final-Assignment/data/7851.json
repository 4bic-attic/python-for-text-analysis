Breslau and the rest of Lower Silesia was overrun by the Soviet Red Army in the spring of 1945 as the Allies closed in on Berlin from east and west. \n\nRichter and Koper said the train wasn\u2019t found in an abandoned tunnel, as previously reported. It is buried under the ground near the rail line, the men said. \n\nThey also proposed making the train a local tourist attraction once it is unearthed and its cargo recovered. \n\n\u2014 Los Angeles Times", "source": "Gulf News"}
