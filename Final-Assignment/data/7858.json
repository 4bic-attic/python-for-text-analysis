The main rumours suggest the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will be announced at the event but It\u2019s looking increasingly likely we\u2019ll see three iPhone models released this year. The iPhone 6C has been long rumoured, even since the launch of the original \"budget\" iPhone model in 2013. While the iPhone 5C was designed purely as a more affordable iPhone, the iPhone 6C is likely to have more to differentiate it, with a smaller screen than either of the 6S models. Currently the only way to get an iPhone with a 4.0-inch screen any more is to buy the 18-month old iPhone 5S or iPhone 5C, both of which may well be discontinued with the launch of the next wave of devices, especially if we do get an iPhone 6C, so it will likely be aimed both at those who want to save some money and those who want to save some pocket space. We\u2019re not sure if the iPhone 6C will launch alongside the refreshed iPhone line \u2013 but given it\u2019s set to appear this year, it has to at least be mentioned at the event. iPhone 7 / iPhone 6S release date, news and rumours Cut to the chase What is it? The replacement to the iPhone 5C When is it out? Maybe late September What will it cost? Hopefully not as much as the 5C iPhone 6C release date The latest rumours suggest the iPhone 6C is set to launch alongside the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. That event is set for Wednesday September 9 so we may end up seeing the phone within the next week. If news from famed Twitter leaker Evan Blass is to be believed the iPhone 6C will be at that event alongside the other two phones and more details on iOS 9. The rumor mill has gone quiet on this phone of late though, with multiple reports placing its launch in November \u2013 could Apple possibly unveil a new phone only on press release in October or similar? iPhone 6C news and rumors Several different sources have spoken of an iPhone 6C, so it seems increasingly likely that it\u2019s coming, though there are still some voices of dissent. When it does arrive it will probably have a lot in common with the iPhone 5C, as there\u2019s talk and even an image of a plastic shell. If it does launch with a plastic body then there\u2019s no doubt that it will be cheaper than Apple\u2019s flagship phones, though how much cheaper remains to be seen. Apple might even have leaked them phone itself, with a weird render showing an iPhone 5C-a-like bearing the unmistakeable TouchID button in the picture \u2013 but that seems a bit early for a phone that we won\u2019t see until September, so let\u2019s chalk that one up to a glitch in the matrix. While the iPhone 6C is expected to look a lot like the iPhone 5C it could have ever so slightly curved screen edges, like the iPhone 6 does. It may also share some specs with the iPhone 6, as it\u2019s rumored that the colourful handset will ship with an A8 processor, though while that\u2019s at the top end now bear in mind that the iPhone 6S will almost certainly have a newer, faster chip, marking the iPhone 6C out as a lower end phone. It\u2019s also rumoured to have NFC and Touch ID, which could mean Apple Pay support, and of course if it launches this year it will run iOS 9. The rest of its specs are completely unknown, but there\u2019s a good chance it will borrow liberally from the iPhone 6, given that the iPhone 5C stayed very close to the iPhone 5. There may also be some bad news though \u2013 it\u2019s possible Apple has dropped the iPhone 6C all together. Analysts at Cowen & Company noticed clues in the supply chain that suggested the iPhone 6C was in production but bizarrely a few days later the clues disappeared. Those very same analysts are now speculating that the phone won\u2019t be launching later this year and Apple has axed it due to a worry it\u2019ll eat into current model sales. Timothy Arcuri at the company said, \"I think one of the reasons (Apple reportedly cancelled an iPhone 6c) is because the iPhone 6 has sold so well. And they said, \u2018Look, why would we want to cannibalize? If we came out with an iPhone 6C, we would essentially cannibalize a price-reduced iPhone 6.\u2019\" We\u2019ve got our fingers crossed they\u2019re wrong \u2013 and they very much could be \u2013 but it\u2019s also important to note they know what they\u2019re talking about and it could be bad news for the cheaper iPhone option. There are still glimmers of hope though, and a Digitimes report claims it sources say the iPhone 6C is still very much on its way, but it\u2019ll break ranks from Apple\u2019s usual annual release cycle and instead show its face during the second quarter of 2016. What we want to see 1. Touch ID While the iPhone 5S has Touch ID, the iPhone 5C (which launched alongside it) doesn\u2019t. Two years on it\u2019s unlikely that Apple would keep it out of the iPhone 6C, but it is a worry, especially as the phone is likely to be positioned as a budget alternative to the iPhone 6S. We really, really hope that doesn\u2019t happen though, as it\u2019s one of the best recent iPhone features and not having it would severely limit the iPhone 6C\u2019s appeal. Thankfully its inclusion has already been rumored. 2. A powerful processor As a budget device we don\u2019t expect the iPhone 6C to match the iPhone 6S, but we hope it comes close, especially as it\u2019s likely to be the best 4-inch iPhone around. Buyers who want a smaller phone shouldn\u2019t be overly penalised on specs so we\u2019d like to see high-end performance from the iPhone 6C. Current rumors point to it packing the same chip as the iPhone 6, which should just about cut it. 3. A 4.0-inch screen While it\u2019s expected that the iPhone 6C will have a 4.0-inch screen it\u2019s not actually confirmed, but we really hope it does. If Apple only released one iPhone size we\u2019d want it to be the now standard 4.7-inch model, but choice is always good and we\u2019d wager there are many Apple fans who were disappointed by the move to larger screens, so a new model with a small screen would be much appreciated. 4. A more affordable price While the iPhone 5C was designed to be a comparatively budget option it wasn\u2019t and even now still isn\u2019t particularly cheap. So we\u2019d like to see the iPhone 6C be truly affordable. Perhaps not entry-level, but with a mid-range price of around \u00a3300/$400/AU$500. 5. A more premium design One of the cost cutting measures employed with the iPhone 5C was to replace the premium metal and glass builds of other iPhone models with a colourful plastic shell. It\u2019s a solid, well-built phone, but it undeniably looks far less premium or stylish than other Apple handsets. We\u2019d love to see Apple not skimp on the build materials with the iPhone 6C. Of course it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019ll get both a premium build and a lower price, but we can dream. 6. A slim build Given that the iPhone 6C will likely be more compact than the iPhone 6S it would be great if Apple went all out and made it simmer too, so it\u2019s truly as pocket friendly as possible. The iPhone 5C is 9mm thick, but we\u2019d like to see the iPhone 6C drop down to around 6.9mm thick like the iPhone 6. 7. Plenty of storage The iPhone 5C was initially sold in several storage sizes, but it\u2019s now just available in a near useless 8GB model. Given that Apple doesn\u2019t allow for expandable storage 16GB is the absolute minimum that we consider acceptable and even that\u2019s pushing it these days. So hopefully the iPhone 6C will be available with a range of storage capacities and if 32GB was the smallest we wouldn\u2019t complain. 8. Better battery life The iPhone 5C has respectable battery life, but it\u2019s still a phone you\u2019ll be charging every night, so we\u2019d like to see the iPhone 6C have longer life. Very few phones last as long as we\u2019d like, but we\u2019ve seen from the likes of the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact that two days is possible, so we want to see that from the iPhone 6C.
