It took 10 minutes for medical staff to remove Shaw safely off the pitch in a stretcher while he breathed out of an oxygen mask. \n\n\"It's a very sad time and we wish him a quick recovery,\" said United defender Chris Smalling after the match, adding that the diagnosis was still uncertain. \n\nShaw himself tweeted out his gratitude to the fans for all their well wishes, saying he was \"gutted\" and \"will come back stronger.\" \n\nThank you everyone for your messages , words can't describe how gutted I am , my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger. \n\u2014 Luke Shaw (@LukeShaw23) September 15, 2015 \u00a0 \nMemphis Depay, who helped PSV win the Eredivisie league last year by chipping in 22 goals, speculated before the match that his boyhood club's fans would allow him the indulgence of celebrating should he knock one in for his new team. \n\nAnd, with a clinical build up that eluded two defenders before slipping the ball in between PSV goalkeeper Joreon Zoet's legs, Depay raised his arms and celebrated in style. The away section went wild, while the home fans politely acknowledged that their former talisman had moved on to greener pastures (while netting PSV approximately $38 million). \n\n\"If I score I will celebrate,\" he said in an interview before the match. \"I have a lot of respect (for PSV) but everyone can understand, when I score I celebrate.\" \n\n\"It's a great stadium, great atmosphere and a lot of memories. This is my second home and Manchester is now my new home,\" he added. \n\nIn other action, Manchester City lost at home 2-1 to Juventus in a come-from-behind win for the Italians. Last year's Champions League hero Alvaro Morata came through again with a winner in the 81st minute. Manchester United, who are at the top of the Premiership table, had not lost a domestic match this season, while Juventus had not earned a single victory in Serie A where they sit in 17th place. \n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid cruised to a 4-0 victory over Shaktar Donetsk behind a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portugese \"galactico\" is now the all-time leading goalscorer in Champions League history with 80, surpassing rival Lionel Messi by three goals. The only other active player in the top 10 is Didier Drogba with 44. Drogba, however, now plays in Canada. \n\nEl Madrid gana 4-0 su primer partido de Champions con un hat-trick de @Cristiano . http://t.co/6sIajwRu2m  #RMUCL  pic.twitter.com/asToESP7AW \n\u2014 Real Madrid C.
