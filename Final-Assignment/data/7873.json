(The entire album track can be heard in the fifth-season episode \"Unreasonable Facsimile\" as Ironside and team track a suspect on the streets of San Francisco.) In addition to the opening theme music,\u00a0Quincy Jones\u00a0composed the entire score for the first eight episodes.\u00a0Oliver Nelson\u00a0took over those duties up to the end of the winter to spring 1972 episodes. Nelson was then replaced by\u00a0Marty Paich\u00a0for all the episodes from the beginning of the fall of that year up until the last episode that was produced in the spring of 1974. The song \"Even When you Cry\" with music by\u00a0Quincy Jones\u00a0and lyrics by\u00a0Alan Bergman\u00a0and\u00a0Marilyn Bergman\u00a0was performed by\u00a0James Farentino\u00a0in the episode 'Something for Nothing' while\u00a0Marcia Strassman\u00a0had already sung it off-screen in the earlier episode 'The Man Who Believed' both during season 1. I wonder if that Season One score has been released?", "source": "Anyways..."}
