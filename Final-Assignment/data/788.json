The Lady Lynx took second in jazz, third in kick and placed sixth in the pom division. \n\nBV head coach Tracy Kuhn said she saw huge improvement in her team\u2019s jazz performance, \n\n\u201cOur jazz routine was a huge improvement for their second time and will continue to be competitive, and it\u2019s going to be our strongest routine this season if we can correct some timing and technical issues,\u201d she said. \n\nKuhn said there is still some work to be done in their pom and kick routines. \n\n\u201cWe are not getting the results we should from the judges in our pom routine. It is packed with difficulty and scoring is not reflecting this, therefore we will be working on some changes to clean it up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our kick routine, although very unique and full of sass, is not a judge\u2019s favorite, so we will be making some overall improvements to this routine and will be excited for a strong showing at our home invite.\u201d \n\nAfter competing Tuesday at the Huron Invitational, both cheer and dance programs will prepare for the upcoming BV Invite, which starts at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 6. \n\nBrookings Invite \n\nDance results \n\nHip Hop: SF Washington 273.5; SF Lincoln 267.5; Huron 257; SF Roosevelt 252.5; O\u2019Gorman 224.5; Pierre 214; Mitchell 207.5; Platte-Geddes 198.5. \n\nJazz: SFW 264; Brandon Valley 258.5; Dakota Valley 235; SFR 230; Yankton 225.5; Watertown 205; Huron 203; Mitchell 180; Brookings 177; Aberdeen Central 176; Pierre 170.5. \n\nKick: SF Lincoln 283; Yankton 283; Brandon Valley 275.5; Dakota Valley 268.5; Watertown 267; Brookings 257.5; Pierre 240.5; O\u2019Gorman 237.5; Aberdeen Central 202.5; Platte-Geddes 201.5. \n\nPom: SFW 290; Dakota Valley 287; Yankton 272.5; SFL 270.5; SFR 265; Brandon Valley 262; Brookings 259; Watertown258; O\u2019Gorman 246.5; Huron 243.5; Aberdeen Central 228.5; Platte-Geddes 227; Mitchell 210. \n\nGrand champion: SFW 275.88; SFL 273.67; Brandon Valley 265.33; Dakota Valley 263.50; Yankton 260.33; SFR 249.17; Watertown 243.33; O\u2019Gorman 236.17; Huron 234.50; Brookings 231.17; Platte-Geddes 209; Pierre 208.33; Aberdeen Central 202.33; Mitchell 199.17. \n\nCheer results \n\nGrand champion: SF Roosevelt 269.50; Brandon Valley 238; O\u2019Gorman 232; Watertown 231.50; SF Washington 229.50; Brookings 228.50; Huron 216; SF Lincoln 208.50; Aberdeen Central 203; Sioux Valley 199; Dell Rapids 194.50; Dakota Valley 194; Yankton 194; Platte-Geddes 188.50; Pierre 177; Wagner 175.50; Dell Rapids St. Mary\u2019s 154; Mitchell 141.50. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1Fcn5r7", "source": "Argus Leader"}
