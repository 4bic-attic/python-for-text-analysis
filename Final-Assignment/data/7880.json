(Photo: John Partipilo / The Tennessean) \n\nNashville\u00a0leaders are being asked to\u00a0weigh\u00a0whether a city-sanctioned homeless encampment can help\u00a0solve the recurrent issue\u00a0of illegal camps that crop up on their own across Davidson County. \n\nAbout 30 people brainstormed ideas of what an authorized encampment would look like during a Monday afternoon meeting facilitated by members of the Metro Homelessness Commission, said Will Connelly, the director of the commission. The group's recommendations\u00a0will be passed on to\u00a0the commission's executive committee for consideration, he said. \n\n\"There was some agreement, and there was some places where we\u2019re going to have to work our way through,\" Connelly said. \"There are people that are sleeping outside that are fearful or just reluctant to sleep in the traditional shelters, so is an authorized encampment part of the\u00a0solution for them?\" \n\nThe meeting comes on the heels of the Metro Parks and Recreation Department's attempts to disband a homeless encampment hidden in the hillside near Fort Negley and the Adventure Science Center. On Sept. 1, the 30 or so people staying at the camp were told they had until Sept. 15 to move on or they would be in violation of an overnight camping ban. \n\nHowever, advocates for the homeless say disbanding\u00a0encampments\u00a0just displaces the residents to other parts of Nashville, which has limited affordable housing options. \n\nThe Fort Negley encampment precipitated Monday's meeting, but the group that\u00a0included\u00a0people experiencing homelessness and\u00a0those\u00a0who advocate for them tried to take a broad look at the issue, Connelly said. He added that more voices are needed in the discussion. \n\nSince the Fort Negley\u00a0deadline passed, park police have issued six\u00a0citations \u2014 three for overnight camping and three for criminal trespassing \u2014 to residents at the camp, said Jackie Jones, Metro Parks spokeswoman. About\u00a0six people\u00a0remain at the encampment, she said. \n\n\u201cThe key focus of my administration is to find alternative locations for those who are camping at Fort Negley.\u201d \nMayor Megan Barry \nThe\u00a0parks department put enforcement of the camping ban on hold in advance of the Monday meeting, and has requested a meeting with Mayor Megan Barry to find out what other\u00a0solutions may work, said Metro Parks Director Tommy Lynch. \n\nBarry, who took office 10 days after the deadline, said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday that police force should be a last resort for dealing with an unauthorized encampment. She doesn't anticipate the need for arrests or criminal citations. \n\n\u201cThe key focus of my administration is to find alternative locations for those who are camping at Fort Negley. I\u2019m optimistic that by working with the homelessness commission, the homeless community and advocates, our Metro Parks, and the faith community, we can find a workable solution that realizes the fact that our public parks are not campgrounds, and they can\u2019t be used as such,\" Barry said. \n\nReach Holly Meyer at 615-259-8241 and on Twitter @HollyAMeyer.\u00a0 \n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1KJE3fH", "source": "Tennessean"}
