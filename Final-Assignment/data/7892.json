It was three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. It was the time for prayer.\u00a02\u00a0A man unable to walk was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful. He had been that way since he was born. Every day someone put him near the gate. There he would beg from people going into the temple courtyards.\u00a03\u00a0He saw that Peter and John were about to enter. So he asked them for money.\u00a04\u00a0Peter looked straight at him, and so did John. Then Peter said, \u201cLook at us!\u201d\u00a05\u00a0So the man watched them closely. He expected to get something from them.\n6\u00a0Peter said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any silver or gold. But I\u2019ll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.\u201d\u00a07\u00a0Then Peter took him by the right hand and helped him up. At once the man\u2019s feet and ankles became strong.\u00a08\u00a0He jumped to his feet and began to walk. He went with Peter and John into the temple courtyards. He walked and jumped and praised God.\u00a09\u00a0All the people saw him walking and praising God.\u00a010\u00a0They recognized him as the same man who used to sit and beg at the temple gate called Beautiful. They were filled with wonder. They were amazed at what had happened to him.\n\n11\u00a0The man was holding on to Peter and John. All the people were amazed. They came running to them at the place called Solomon\u2019s Porch.\u00a012\u00a0When Peter saw this, he said, \u201cFellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us? It\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve made this man walk by our own power or godliness.\u00a013\u00a0The God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has done this. God has brought glory to Jesus, who serves him. But you handed Jesus over to be killed. Pilate had decided to let him go. But you spoke against Jesus when he was in Pilate\u2019s court.\u00a014\u00a0You spoke against the Holy and Blameless One. You asked for a murderer to be set free instead.\u00a015\u00a0You killed the one who gives life. But God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.\u00a016\u00a0This man whom you see and know was made strong because of faith in Jesus\u2019 name. Faith in Jesus has healed him completely. You can see it with your own eyes.\n\n17\u00a0\u201cMy fellow Israelites, I know you didn\u2019t realize what you were doing. Neither did your leaders.\u00a018\u00a0But God had given a promise through all the prophets. And this is how he has made his promise come true. He said that his Messiah would suffer.\u00a019\u00a0So turn away from your sins. Turn to God. Then your sins will be wiped away. The time will come when the Lord will make everything new.\u00a020\u00a0He will send the Messiah. Jesus has been appointed as the Messiah for you.\u00a021\u00a0Heaven must receive him until the time when God makes everything new. He promised this long ago through his holy prophets.\u00a022\u00a0Moses said, \u2018The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me. He will be one of your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you.\u00a023\u00a0Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.\u2019 (Deuteronomy 18:15,18,19)\n\n24\u00a0\u201cBeginning with Samuel, all the prophets spoke about this. They said these days would come.\u00a025\u00a0What the prophets said was meant for you. The covenant God made with your people long ago is yours also. He said to Abraham, \u2018All nations on earth will be blessed through your children.\u2019 (Genesis 22:18;\u00a026:4)\u00a026\u00a0God raised up Jesus, who serves him. God sent him first to you. He did it to bless you. He wanted to turn each of you from your evil ways.\u201d\nActs 4\n1\u00a0Peter and John were speaking to the people. The priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees came up to the apostles.\u00a02\u00a0They were very upset by what the apostles were teaching the people. The apostles were saying that people can be raised from the dead. They said this can happen because Jesus rose from the dead.\u00a03\u00a0So the temple authorities arrested Peter and John. It was already evening, so they put them in prison until the next day.\u00a04\u00a0But many who heard the message believed. The number of men who believed grew to about 5,000.\n5\u00a0The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.\u00a06\u00a0Annas, the high priest, was there. So were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and other people in the high priest\u2019s family.\u00a07\u00a0They had Peter and John brought to them. They wanted to question them. \u201cBy what power did you do this?\u201d they asked. \u201cAnd through whose name?\u201d\n\n8\u00a0Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit. He said to them, \u201cRulers and elders of the people!\u00a09\u00a0Are you asking us to explain our actions today? Do you want to know why we were kind to a man who couldn\u2019t walk? Are you asking how he was healed?\u00a010\u00a0Then listen to this, you and all the people of Israel! You nailed Jesus Christ of Nazareth to the cross. But God raised him from the dead. It is through Jesus\u2019 name that this man stands healed in front of you.\u00a011\u00a0Scripture says that Jesus is\n\n\u201c\u2009\u2018the stone you builders did not accept.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it has become the most important stone of all.\u2019\u00a0(Psalm 118:22)\n\n\n12\u00a0You can\u2019t be saved by believing in anyone else. God has given people no other name under heaven that will save them.\u201d\n13\u00a0The leaders saw how bold Peter and John were. They also realized that Peter and John were ordinary men with no training. This surprised the leaders. They realized that these men had been with Jesus.\u00a014\u00a0The leaders could see the man who had been healed. He was standing there with them. So there was nothing they could say.\u00a015\u00a0They ordered Peter and John to leave the Sanhedrin. Then they talked things over.\u00a016\u00a0\u201cWhat can we do with these men?\u201d they asked. \u201cEveryone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed an unusual miracle. We can\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen.\u00a017\u00a0We have to stop this thing. It must not spread any further among the people. We have to warn these men. They must never speak to anyone in Jesus\u2019 name again.\u201d\n18\u00a0Once again the leaders called in Peter and John. They commanded them not to speak or teach at all in Jesus\u2019 name.\u00a019\u00a0But Peter and John replied, \u201cWhich is right from God\u2019s point of view? Should we listen to you? Or should we listen to God? You be the judges!\u00a020\u00a0There\u2019s nothing else we can do. We have to speak about the things we\u2019ve seen and heard.\u201d\n\n21\u00a0The leaders warned them again. Then they let them go. They couldn\u2019t decide how to punish Peter and John. They knew that all the people were praising God for what had happened.\u00a022\u00a0The man who had been healed by the miracle was over 40 years old.\n\n23\u00a0Peter and John were allowed to leave. They went back to their own people. They reported everything the chief priests and the elders had said to them.\u00a024\u00a0The believers heard this. Then they raised their voices together in prayer to God. \u201cLord and King,\u201d they said, \u201cyou made the heavens, the earth and the sea. You made everything in them.\u00a025\u00a0Long ago you spoke by the Holy Spirit. You spoke through the mouth of our father David, who served you. You said,\n\n\u201c\u2009\u2018Why are the nations angry?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why do the people make useless plans?\n26\u00a0The kings of the earth rise up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rulers of the earth gather together\nagainst the Lord\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and against his anointed king.\u2019\u00a0(Psalm 2:1,2)\n\n\n27\u00a0In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate met with the Gentiles in this city. They also met with the people of Israel. All of them made plans against your holy servant Jesus. He is the one you anointed.\u00a028\u00a0They did what your power and purpose had already decided should happen.\u00a029\u00a0Now, Lord, consider the bad things they say they are going to do. Help us to be very bold when we speak your word.\u00a030\u00a0Stretch out your hand to heal. Do signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\u201d\n31\u00a0After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They were bold when they spoke God\u2019s word.\n32\u00a0All the believers were agreed in heart and mind. They didn\u2019t claim that anything they had was their own. Instead, they shared everything they owned.\u00a033\u00a0With great power the apostles continued their teaching. They were telling people that the Lord Jesus had risen from the dead. And God\u2019s grace was working powerfully in all of them.\u00a034\u00a0So there were no needy persons among them. From time to time, those who owned land or houses sold them. They brought the money from the sales.\u00a035\u00a0They put it down at the apostles\u2019 feet. It was then given out to anyone who needed it.\n\n36\u00a0Joseph was a Levite from Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. The name Barnabas means Son of Help.\u00a037\u00a0Barnabas sold a field he owned. He brought the money from the sale. He put it down at the apostles\u2019 feet.", "source": "BCBC YOUTH RALLY AROUND THE WORD"}
