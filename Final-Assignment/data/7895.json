In Tesla\u2019s relatively vague referral language: \n  \n\u201cPlease note that we may withhold credits, discounts or other awards where we believe customers are acting in bad faith or otherwise acting contrary to the intent of this program.\u201d \n  \nThis\u00a0may not end well.\u00a0 \n \nWe already know that the potential referrer would likely qualify for an income tax credit from the feds for referring 10 new Model S buyers . It now appears that, at least\u00a0according to\u00a0the Tesla community, the referring winner may have used unsavory means as well. \n \nShould Tesla withhold the car for spam posting, it could be a fight over the \u201cfree\u201d $133,000 car. \n \nThe only winner in Tesla\u2019s referral program \u2014 at least in the U.S. \u2014 may very well be Tesla itself. \n \n\n \nThis entry passed through the Full-Text RSS service \u2013 if this is your content and you\u2019re reading it on someone else\u2019s site, please read the FAQ at fivefilters.org/content-only/faq.php#publishers. \n \nhttp://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/", "source": "Automnews.com"}
