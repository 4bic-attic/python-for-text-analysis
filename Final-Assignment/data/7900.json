Craig Rickert sat down with Senator Boozman before he toured the station and talked about a number of hot-button topics in politics. \n\nNumber one, Donald Trump. Rickert asked the Senator if the businessman and celebrity is hurting or helping the GOP.\n\n\u201cWell, I'll tell you, the ratings they are getting, the way people are tuning in that have never tuned in to debates before, I think the good news for Republicans is there are a bunch of people on stage in the debates that are very capable. I think we are in good shape that way,\u201d Boozman said.\n\nBoozman added, on the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders is creating the same kind of buzz Trump is on the Republican side.\n\nWhat is he going to do next? It's one of the most common questions in politics right now. But this time, it's not about Donald Trump, but Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhen asked what happens to Hillary Clinton if Biden decides to make a White House run, Boozman said \"I think it would hurt her in the sense that they would have a brutal primary, lots of money spent. There is a finite amount of money that can be spent. She would have to spend a lot of money defending herself. And right now it seems the trend is against her.\"\n\nRecent polls show Clinton is losing ground to Biden and Sanders.\n\nCopyright 2015 KAIT.
