Source: Supplied Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group is investing in an Indian mobile payments company, its latest move into the South Asian nation\u2019s start-up boom. Alibaba and its financial services affiliate, Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group (known as Ant Financial), are jointly investing in India\u2019s One97 Communications, which runs PayTM, India\u2019s dominant mobile-payments service.\n\nAlibaba and Ant Financial wouldn\u2019t disclose the value of the deal or how large a stake they have in One97. In February, Ant Financial said it was buying a 25 per cent stake in One97 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nSources said the investment gave Alibaba and Ant Financial a combined 40 per cent stake in One97, and that the companies had invested a total of about $US680 million ($970m) for the One97 stake.\n\nAlibaba, which runs China\u2019s largest e-commerce empire, has been searching for a foothold in India\u2019s budding online retail market as it faces increased competition and slowing revenue growth at home. Last month, it invested $US200m in Snapdeal, one of India\u2019s largest e-commerce companies.\n\nOne97 said it planned to use the funds to reach its goal of having 500 million Indians using its services.
