With every bit of resistance, my faith muscles are getting stronger and stronger.\n\nInstead of focusing on the struggle, we should lean into His promises.\n\nEven if it takes time, we know the Lord will bring our brokenness to full restoration.\nEphesians 6:10-19(NLT)\nThe Whole Armor of God\n10\u00a0A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11\u00a0Put on all of God\u2019s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. 12\u00a0For we\u00a0are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.\n13\u00a0Therefore, put on every piece of God\u2019s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.14\u00a0Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God\u2019s righteousness. 15\u00a0For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared.16\u00a0In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.\u00a017\u00a0Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n\n18\u00a0Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.\n\nBe blessed, keep God first and keep looking up,\n\nCheryl", "source": "Today's Sisters in Faith"}
