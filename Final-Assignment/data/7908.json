Protesters claimed authorities violently overreacted to marchers. \n\nThe charges stem from a nationwide wave of demonstrations that began in February 2014 in western Tachira state by university students. The protests paralyzed parts of the country for weeks. \n\nLopez, who signed a manifesto this year calling for the removal of President Nicolas Maduro from office, has been held in a military prison for 18 months. Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who also signed the manifesto, was also jailed this year on charges of conspiracy to commit violence and subsequently released on house arrest. He also denies having advocated violence. \n\nLopez\u2019s wife, Lilian Tintori, said Thursday night after the verdict was read that he urged supporters to \u201c\u2019maintain calm.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Put the handcuffs on me because the judge and the justice system won\u2019t take them off, only the Venezuelan people,\u2019\u201d Tintori quoted her husband as saying in the court room after the verdict. \n\nOn Friday a tweet from Lopez\u2019 account included a photo of a hand-written letter giving encouragement to his supporters. \n\nMaria Corina Machado, another prominent opposition leader who was physically attacked on the floor of the National Assembly in 2013 before being expelled from the congress last year, has been accused of conspiring in a plot to kill Maduro, a charge she denies. \n\nFormer Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez said Venezuela has become a \u201cde facto dictatorship\u201d and said Lopez and other political prisoners have been accused of \u201cviolent acts that are the responsibility of the government.\u201d \n\nCritics say the crackdown on opposition figures has an electoral motive with all-important National Assembly elections coming up in December. Analysts said Maduro could be aiming to deprive the opposition of leaders to confuse voters.", "source": "Charlotte Observer"}
