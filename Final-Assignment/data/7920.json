To the extent there is interference from an outside party, be it the Government or anyone else, it could compromise the development. Unless they were sent on a specific mission, that could be considered interference in the process.\u201d \n \nAll communications from Ed Rahming, the Bahamian accountant and partner in KRyS Global (Bahamas), and UK duo Nick Cropper and Alastair Beveridge, have emphasised that the Supreme Court gave them the power \u201cto promote a scheme of arrangement and/or compromise with all stakeholders\u201d. \n \nIn other words, to bring all parties together - including the Chinese, Baha Mar developer Sarkis Izmirlian, the Government and creditors - and explore whether a commercial solution for Baha  Mar\u2019s construction completion and opening can be reached. \n \nMr Turnquest said he had no concerns about the provisional liquidators\u2019 integrity, explaining that he knew Mr Rahming and respected his professionalism. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing the best job they can in the circumstances and the problems they\u2019re faced with,\u201d he added. \n \nThe FNM deputy leader, though, reiterated his concern that the Christie administration - and the Prime Minister in particular - appeared to effectively be doing the provisional liquidators\u2019 job by promoting a resolution scheme with the Chinese. \n \n\u201cMy only concern is they [the provisional liquidators] be allowed to do their job without interference by any party, so they can achieve the best result in the quickest possible time for the benefit of all stakeholders, creditors and especially the Bahamian people,\u201d Mr Turnquest told Tribune Business. \n \nThis newspaper revealed on Friday how the provisional liquidators had sought Supreme Court approval to borrow $25 million, some $8.7 million of which was earmarked to pay Baha Mar\u2019s insurance premiums and ensure the Melia Nassau Beach Hotel could continue operating. \n \nTribune Business last night received confirmation that the Supreme Court had granted the necessary approval, with the $8.7 million set to come from the China Export-Import Bank. \n \nThe remaining $16.262 million is necessary to fund the joint provisional liquidation, and the expenses incurred in running Baha Mar and paying staff salaries, until the process is completed on November 4. \n \nMr Turnquest, though, questioned how the $25 million would be secured, and why China Export-Import Bank would suddenly decide to lend money to Baha Mar when it had cut Mr Izmirlian off from the last tranche of construction financing. \n \n\u201cThe question is what are they using for collateral, and is this a situation where once the developer has been removed, all of a sudden the lender of record is willing to lend,\u201d the FNM deputy leader said. \n \n\u201cAt the end of the day, what has changed? They\u2019re willing to lend to the liquidators; what guarantees are they getting that they could not get from the developer? \n \n\u2018The real question is what is the Government\u2019s role, if anything, and what commitments is the Government making to secure this funding? Have they made any commitments to secure this funding on behalf of the liquidator?\u201d \n \nThe China Export-Import Bank withheld the last $112 million of the original $2.45 billion credit facility because extending this without a further equity investment would have breached the 7:3 debt-to-equity ratio imposed as a condition of the financing. \n \nBaha Mar subsequently claimed that CCA failed to come up with its $15 million balance of the equity investment, but the provisional liquidators asked China Export-Import Bank to waive this ratio as a condition for extending the insurance monies. \n \n\u201cWe assume it is going to work out for the best,\u201d Mr Turnquest said of Baha Mar, \u201cbut my concern is, one, we make sure the Government is not making any wonderful commitments on behalf of the construction company, and that, two, they are not inserting themselves into the work of the liquidators.\u201d \n \nHe added of the Prime Minister\u2019s efforts: \u201cHopefully, there will be some kind of favourable result. The last time the Prime Minister told us there was good news, there was a bankruptcy filing. Let;s hope he has better results this time.\u201d \n \nTo-date, despite the fanfare, CCA and the China Export-Import Bank have publicly done little more than act on previous commitments to get the Baha Mar project completed and open in the shortest possible time. \n \nThe Prime Minister is due to meet with Mr Izmirlian, the final party in the dispute, today. It remains to be seen whether they can build a relationship that was fractured by post-Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing recriminations.", "source": "The Tribune"}
