These are five tracks that come in, show off their influences, get to the point and float out into the ether.\nThe title track was inspired by Liza Violets flu hallucinations, displaying a Pixies light vibe; their noise pop brings to mind tons of 90\u2019s alt rock references from measure to measure. A light punk-ish Weezer tone is brought out for \u201cHey Toupe\u201d while \u201cGhoul Power\u201d gets angular. \u201cThe Line\u201d is perhaps the most satisfying track with surf influences and a melodic ending.\nThe retro 90\u2019s vibe of fellow Brits Yuck are the groups closest current parallel but for fans sick of reaching back to their worn out buzz bin, sunning on Menace Beach\u2019s sonic shore provides a suitable alternative.\u00a0 ______________________________________________________________________\nSupport the band here, buy the album here and peep some audio/video below:", "source": "Rock The Body Electric"}
