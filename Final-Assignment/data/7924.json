We've already announced that we will be in a new space on Sunday, October 4, 2015. We must! We have put a demand on the great Law of the Universe. We know that it must be met.\u00a0\n\nYesterday, we found the place. The thing that is most fascinating about this is that we looked at this place almost two years ago. It was in terrible condition and over priced. At that time we walked out.\u00a0\n\nWell, yesterday, we were led back to the same building, but a different section...so we thought. However, when the realtor began to walk us back to the same area of the building, our hearts sank. Then he opened the door. \"Oh my God!\" was this the same spot? It looked brand new and it was perfect. Not just that; it had dropped in price to exactly what we had budgeted. The space has been empty for over 4 years. It was as if it had been waiting for us.\n\nSo, now, there are still things that need to be worked out. A few times yesterday it looked as if it might not happen. That is when I started using, \"This or better!\" If it is right, it is done with ease and grace. \"This or better!\"\u00a0\n\nThese things should be so natural for all of us. We make our demand and the Universe fills the mold. Center for Spiritual Living Kaua'i is in the Law's hands now. We move out of the way of the hows. We know perfect timing. \n\nToday, we will find out more; however, we know that on Sunday, September 13, we will be announcing an address to our Ohana for Sunday, October 4th. \"This or better!\"\n\nLove, Love, Love,\nRev.
