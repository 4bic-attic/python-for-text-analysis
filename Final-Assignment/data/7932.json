Maybe because it doesn\u2019t take a lot of additional planning to put an existing opt-in offer there. Or we could simply be conditioned to thinking pop-ups equal opt-ins. \n \nHere\u2019s the trouble with opt-ins on exit. What\u2019s the incentive? I\u2019m not saying a plain opt-in doesn\u2019t work. It could, but everything can be better. What if, the opt-in copy is tweaked to promise a content upgrade? What if it was written to \u2018match\u2019 the content of the post they were just at? \n \nPop-ups, both entry or exit can be used for anything and any message . The key is in the planning and thinking through. In this post, I\u2019ll show you an exit pop-up I found on Health Ambition. A site on health related news and information. \n \n\n \nNotice the pop-up has no opt-in. Instead, it promotes a product. The other thing of note, this pop-up only appeared on a specific post . That post talked about what causes yellow teeth and yes, it does promote the product in the content itself, but only mentioned once. \n \nWhether the post is a paid advertisement or not, I don\u2019t know. I also don\u2019t know how well it works.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s intriguing enough for me to try. After all, if we don\u2019t try, we don\u2019t know and if it works for others, it may work for you. Or not. There\u2019s just no way to find out except to implement.\u00a0Here\u2019s how I\u00a0duplicated this pop-up. \n Step 1: Find A Post  \nI could have looked through old posts. Find one that already has regular traffic. The ideal is a post\u00a0that offers\u00a0a solution (product). Product reviews could also have worked.\u00a0The solution mentioned in the post is preferably one you are an affiliate for. It can also be your own product. \n \nExample: On this post, we are talking about exit pop-ups. Over at Plugin Mill, we happen to have an exit pop-up for sale. This post and product would be an ideal match. \n Step 2: Set Up Your Exit Pop-up  \nSince I have my own exit pop-up\u00a0plugin, I\u2019ll be using it here. Naturally, the directions will vary when using other plugins. The general idea should be the same. \n \nLet\u2019s start by adding a new pop-up.\u00a0Give it\u00a0a title \u2013 this is not shown and only used for internal\u00a0organization. We\u2019ll enter a short description so we can easily figure out what this pop-up is for later. \n \n\n \nNext, we will enter the headline and a brief description of the promo. I also styled a nice BIG button for the link that contrasts nicely so there\u2019s no mistaking. That\u2019s the action I want people to take.\u00a0The copy may not be the best (yet). All I\u2019m interested to do now is get this going. We can always tweak things when we gather more data. \n \n\n \nNote: In our pop-up inspiration, they mentioned Special Offer that runs today . When I clicked through, the page didn\u2019t specifically have a special offer, nor was it time sensitive. I can only suppose this headline created some urgency for people to click. \n \nIf you\u2019re an affiliate, that\u2019s your job. To get people to click through and trust (or hope) the seller\u2019s sales page does the job. \n \nI\u2019m not entirely comfortable with this approach. However, you should probably\u00a0test the response between\u00a0giving a real discount or an implied offer.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at what we\u2019ve got so far. \n \n\n \nEek! Not the design we\u2019re looking for. And it\u2019s kinda small. Our inspiration pop-up is a rather large one. That\u2019s because the default design is in effect. I want to disable that now. This way I can have a design specific to this pop-up only. \n \nI can make this pop-up have many different designs. It\u2019s up to me to try variations\u00a0to see what works best. I still have to start somewhere. That\u2019s why I am going to choose a full screen design. \n \nThis completely covers the screen with one singular, targeted message. In addition, I will give it a background color. I\u2019m hoping this combo will arrest\u00a0attention, stopping people in their tracks and hopefully work better than a regular exit pop-up. \n \n\n Step 3: Implement  \nMy pop-up is done and the next step is to activate it. To do that, I simply go to the post and select the pop-up I just created. \n \n\n \nNow, people will see and be invited to check out this product when they leave, but only on this post where I am promoting the product. With this plugin, I can choose to show a different pop-up on other posts and/pages or none at all. This works out perfectly for our test. \n \n\n Final Thoughts  \nFor this particular pop-up, I did go in to tweak the styles just a little bit to get it\u00a0the way I want it to look. It\u2019s not a lot though.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0If you don\u2019t know how to work HTML and/or CSS, the plugin comes built in with\u00a0a lot of configuration options. \n \nNo test is complete without tracking. Be\u00a0sure to track your clicks. This can be done by\u00a0using a click tracker. That\u2019s what I would do if promoting an affiliate product. If the product is your own, you will naturally have more options and you could use the\u00a0 Google Analytics URL Builder together\u00a0with Goals . This should give you a pretty clear idea what\u2019s happening and if your efforts are paying off. \n \nOnce you have\u00a0nailed down the content and promo, ramp it up. Try\u00a0running some ads leading to the post. \n \nThe post How To Create A Targeted Exit Promo To Lift Sales appeared first on .", "source": "techbasedmarketing.com"}
