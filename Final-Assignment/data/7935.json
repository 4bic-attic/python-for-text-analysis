She was very matted so rather than try to comb things out she got her \u201csummer do\u201d\u2026 from her pictures she was very very happy to have all those matts gone! Molly is around 7 years old and has lived all her life with the same owner. Circumstances changed and Molly found herself looking for a new forever home. Molly weighs about 8 pounds so she is not big at all. She is a happy girl, but can be shy in new surroundings. When startled or if she does not understand what her humans want she will sometimes nip \u2013 for this reason we are looking for a home with no small children in it. She needs understanding, patience and love to help her through this transition. Molly\u2019s foster mom says she has done extremely well with her housetraining\u2026 she has had only one or two accidents in the past two weeks. Molly is heartworm tested, vaccinated, dewormed, treated for any fleas and spayed. Her adoption fee of $390 includes all the vet care that has been done and a health record.
