Miller uses Hazel Artisan Bakery bread from North Canton, Sugar Valley Meats from Sugarcreek, Biery Cheese from Louisville, Fichter Farm produce from Minerva, and other area purveyors. \u201cWe have a farmers\u2019 market approach,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re going for the freshest products possible.\u201d Miller opened Deli Ohio with his wife, Ashten Tullar, in 2013, and it quickly became an area favorite. Since initially focusing on sandwiches, soups and salads, the restaurant has expanded to include breakfast and other specialty side dishes and sodas. The most popular menu item is the Turkey Bacon Avocado. \u201cI can\u2019t make enough of them,\u201d Miller said. Recently, Deli Ohio teamed with Canton\u2019s Arrowhead vintage shop for a series of Deli Ohio Flea and Craft Mart events, which features a variety of unique items. Its inaugural event in June featured around 34 dealers. \u201cIt\u2019s a hipster garage sale, with crafts and handmade stuff by little small companies, and downtown friends that need to clean out their basements and apartments,\u201d said Arrowhead owner Dave Sherill. Deli Ohio is at 328 Walnut Ave. NE in downtown Canton. \u2014 B.J. LISKO", "source": "Canton Repository"}
