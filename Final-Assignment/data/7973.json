September 23, 2015", "id": "ffa57f85-51e1-49d0-a1c6-a3cbf582a3af", "content": "Round Three is all about reflection, for me: where I am, who I am, where I'd like to be, and who I'd like to be when I get there.\n\nWhen you finish a writing project, do you type 'The End'?\nI don't. If I ever have, it was long ago.\nThese days, I see endings and beginnings as softer and more nebulous affairs. I'll revise those projects, probably again and again. Dishes finished today will be replaced by dirty ones within hours \u2013 same with laundry.\nRound Three is ending, and I didn't complete everything I set out to do. The End is near, but I'm not finished...and I'm OK with that.\nWhy?\nBecause the ending is arbitrary. The round officially ends tomorrow. But when I wake up Friday morning, I have exactly the same choice to move forward on my goals, to live my life with intention, that I have as I type these words early on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nThe choice is mine. \nIt's also my choice to decide how to view those goals I didn't finish. Did I fail? Or have I just not yet wholly succeeded? Do I focus on what remains undone, or on the journey made to get to this point?\n\nMy choice \u2013 and yours. What will we choose?\n\n\t\nMy Round 3 Goals Update.
