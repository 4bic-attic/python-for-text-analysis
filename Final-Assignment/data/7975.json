Some kids love it but I think as parents we should have a choice as to whether they see it or not.\"\n\n\"It's right at the entrance so parents haven't got any warning.\" She also raised the point that viewers are warned before images which could be distressing are shown on television.\n\nThe store manager responded by saying he cannot please everyone when putting up seasonal displays.\n\nHe said: \" The display is of the products we have on sale and everything else is at the back of the store.\n\n\"Christmas sales are going to offend Jehovah's witnesses but we can't move them to the back of the store.\"\n\nDo you think the display is too scary for children? Let us know.", "source": "Folkestone Herald"}
