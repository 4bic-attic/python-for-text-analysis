Past headliners have including Kanye West, the Black Keys, and Lana Del Ray. \n\r \n\r\n\tPanorama wouldn\u2019t be AEG\u2019s first foray into the mercurial world of East Coast music festivals. The company was behind the now defunct All Points West held in Liberty State Park in Jersey City in 2008 and 2009. \n\r \n\r\n\tBut they have had better luck elsewhere. Coachella, the company\u2019s biggest fest, held over two weekends in Indio, Calif., drew nearly 200,000 ticketholders this year with performances by Drake and AC/DC. \n\r \r \n\r\n\tA spokesman for AEG declined to comment on the talks. \n\r \n\r\n\tQueens Borough President Melinda Katz cautioned that details have yet to be presented by the company. \n\r \n\r\n\t\u201cWhile we encourage public events of any scale that enhance our borough, this proposal appears to raise significant concerns, especially the precedent it would potentially set,\u201d Katz said, noting that Flushing Meadows Corona Park has never been used by a for-profit company for a charged-admission event. \n\r\n      \r \n\r\n\tSome said the borough that gave birth to the Ramones and Kiss would welcome the fest. \n\r \n\r\n\t\u201cThey already have so many large scale events the only drawback is the traffic and the parking,\u201d said Evelyn DeCoursey of the 110th Precinct Community Council.", "source": "New York Daily News"}
