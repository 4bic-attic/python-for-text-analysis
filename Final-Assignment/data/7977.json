The company also raised its full-year traffic target 1 percent to 104 million passengers. \n\nUnder Chief Executive Officer Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair has sought to broaden Ryanair\u2019s customer appeal by toning down his sales pitch and offering a range of paid-for extras to entice more business passengers and families. The strategy, dubbed Always Getting Better, as well as the strength of the British pound and the U.K.\u2019s wettest August in a century, helped bolster summer sales, Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in an interview. \n\n\u201cThe Always Getting Better plan is continuing to deliver better customer numbers,\u201d Sorahan said. The carrier expects average fares in the third quarter to remain largely unchanged.", "source": "Washington Post"}
