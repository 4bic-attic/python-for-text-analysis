Not the typical September weather that one would expect to reign over Koh Samui at this time of the year, but the 2015 version of August was also out of sync this year compared to most other recorded years by me. At Wat Plai Laem A typical September would be an extension of the nice and sunny weather that August has, but the forecast for the first tend days of this month are not looking too hopeful. We may have some sunshine \u00a0coming our way but it's mainly cloud cover that's predicted, including occasional tropical showers. One thing I'm looking forward to this month will be the Kamalaya charity run this coming 13th September, a Sunday, at the Namuang stadium. See you there! Do 'like' my Koh Samui blog Facebook page and don't forget to use my Camille's Samui hotel recommendation blog and my Camille's Thailand hotel recommendation blog for all your hotel bookings on Koh Samui and around Thailand.
