It\u2019s actually a medicine that\u2019s often used in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it was done in a study where patients who were receiving whole brain radiation either got this medication, or didn\u2019t get this medication. The results of the study suggest that there may be a benefit in terms of preventing the onset of cognitive impairment if you get this medicine.\u00a0 Now, this is one of the very first studies, and it\u2019s a relatively small study \u2014 it probably needs to be duplicated with a larger number of patients, it probably needs to be done in more stringent fashion, to really see and tease out whether this really works. I\u2019ll tell you that, from a radiation oncology community, there\u2019s a fair bit of excitement about this, because we want to do anything we can to potentially reduce this particular complication, because, in the patients that get this disease and survive for a long period of time, we want to keep their mental status as high as possible. In my clinic, when I see patients that bring this up, we often try to get this medication. One of the challenges that we have encountered is that insurance companies are not authorizing this for payment in this particular indication, and a medication, if you are buying it on your own, is awfully expensive.\u00a0 So, we have not had as much success as we\u2019d like, or the clinical experience in seeing patients truly benefit from this. It would be nice to see more studies, more data, and then convince the payers that this actually works, and that this should be moving into the standard of care. But I don\u2019t think, today, that it\u2019s something that we routinely offer to our patients because of these impediments.
