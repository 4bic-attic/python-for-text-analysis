Sports Illustrated validated that opinion by ranking Davis third in the publication's list of the top 100 NBA players. Davis finished ahead of reigning MVP Stephen Curry on this list, and if he continues to develop as expected, he could very well top it in the very near future.", "source": "FOXSports.com"}
