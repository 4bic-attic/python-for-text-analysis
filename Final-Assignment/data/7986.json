The Wildrose said it meant to say socialists and that was lost in translation. \n\nPanda said prior to Thursday's vote that people he was talking to weren't convinced the New Democrats could lead Alberta back to prosperity. \n\n\"They're realizing the NDP tend to believe they have a mandate to implement their ideological agenda, whereas people are really worried about jobs and the economy,\" he said. \n\nHouston said despite Prentice's abrupt departure on election night before all the votes were even counted, he did not encounter residual anger at the party, adding he himself was upset when Prentice stepped down. \n\nIt was the third time in a little over 10 months that Calgary-Foothills voters had gone to the ballot box. \n\nIn preparation for taking over the Alberta Conservatives after the resignation of former premier Alison Redford, Prentice had won the constituency in a byelection in October 2014. \n \n\u00a9", "source": "Weyburn Review"}
