Here are three takeaways:\n1. The Orange kept it interesting. Give them that.\n\nBefore this game, most expected a blowout. Everyone at this blog did. Las Vegas did. National and ACC college football writers did. But Syracuse managed to keep the game close throughout. SU trailed only 7-3 at halftime and was within a touchdown at 24-17 with less than 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter. And even the final score wasn't bad.\n2. Leonard Fournette is really good, if you hadn't heard. \n\nNot that we didn't already know this, but Leonard Fournette is an absolutely incredible running back and showed why on Saturday. He ran for 244 yards on 26 carries, becoming the first player in LSU history to rush for 200 yards in back-to-back games. \u00a0He also scored two touchdowns and had an 87-yard score called back because of an illegal formation.\n3. Mahoney settles down\n\nIn the first half Saturday, Syracuse sophomore walk-on quarterback Zack Mahoney struggled badly. He went 5-of-13 for 35 yards and underthrew open receivers on a couple occasions. But in the second half, Mahoney was much better. He tossed a few good deep balls, including when he threw a 40-yard touchdown to Brisly Estime in the third quarter to pull SU to within 17-10. He threw another touchdown to Ben Lewis in the early stages of the fourth quarter to make the score 24-17.\n\nSoon thereafter, Mahoney threw an interception that essentially sealed the Orange's fate, but for a walk-on junior college transfer, his play was better than you probably expected.", "source": "Troy Nunes Is An Absolute Magician -  All Posts"}
