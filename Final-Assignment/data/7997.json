Public lashings and executions were common under the Taleban, who enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia law from 1996- 2001. The Islamist militant group was ousted from power by a USled coalition and such punishments are now rare. The footage, taken in the western province of Ghor, showed a woman wrapped in a head-to-toe burqa and a man each receive the punishment from a man in a turban wielding a leather whip, watched by a group of mostly seated men. \n \nThe two remained in a crouching position throughout and did not appear to cry out. The sentencing was backed by the government in Ghor province, where the trial took place. \u201cThey had relations a long time ago but were arrested early this month,\u201d a spokesman for governor Seema Jowenda said. \u201cTheir punishment is based on Sharia law and will teach others a lesson.\u201d", "source": "Arab Times"}
