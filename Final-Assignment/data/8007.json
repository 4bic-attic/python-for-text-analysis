He began the month batting .274. \n\nBetts also stole his 20th base of the season, making him the first Red Sox player age 22 or younger to record 20 steals and 15 home runs in a season since Ellis Burks in 1987 (20 home runs, 27 steals). \n\nSo what's changed this month for Betts? \n\n\"Finally recognizing that he's a pretty special player and he feels like he's a big leaguer,\" Torey Lovullo said. \"For the first half of the season he's trying to figure out a lot of things and fit in as a big leaguer and fit in with his teammates, and September has really all come together for him. For me, one of the better players in the American League with a very, very bright future. I think he's feeling that and he's showing that. And that's why [he's having] a great September.\"", "source": "Comcast SportsNet"}
