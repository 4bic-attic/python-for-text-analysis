The hippo and sentiment stamp are both by Fiskars. I stamped them both with Memento black ink and colored the hippo in with Copic Markers. I used an oval punch by Marvy to shape the hippo and a Sizzix oval die for the one behind it. The patterned paper of the oval is by Best Creations as well as the blueish pennants . The blue background paper is by The Paper Studio and the yellow cardstock is by Bazzill. The yellow patterned paper is a scrap from my stash but the yellow heart is a sticker by CM. Thanks for looking.", "source": "cre8ivecindy"}
