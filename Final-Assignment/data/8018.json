Instead, he told a local radio station that he skipped part of the game to watch\u00a0the\u00a0Broadway\u00a0play \u201cLombardi.\u201d\u00a0 \n \nAfter the Jets beat the Colts, their next opponent was New England, and Rex Ryan decided to drop a line about Brady attending a Broadway show. \n \n\u201cPeyton Manning would have been watching our game,\u201d Ryan said at the time . \n \nHe admitted in the book that he did this to purposely try and get into Brady's head. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s one of those deals \u2014 look, the dude is ridiculous. Tom Brady is ridiculous,\" he said, via CSNNE . \"He studies his f\u2014ing\u00a0ass off and so does Peyton. They are 24/7. Damn near. Maybe they had a little time so they went to Broadway, so I said, \u2018Oh, I got them,\u2019 because I knew it would piss him off. This dude is fricking all football. He\u2019s got a life outside football when the season is over. He\u2019s a football junkie. They probably kick his ass out of the building. I was tweaking his ass. I respect the s\u2014\u00a0out of those two guys. But at the same time, f\u2014, I got to beat those f\u2014ers. I have to be at my very best to have a chance to beat them. I know they are that good.\u201d \n \nRyan's head games must have worked because his Jets ended up defeating the Patriots 28-21. Brady wasn't terrible in the matchup as he finished with 299 yards and two touchdowns, but he did have an interception. Maybe, as Brady was dropping back,\u00a0he heard Ryan's taunt in his head and it caused him to throw an errant pass.\u00a0Maybe. \n \n\"Brady vs. Manning\" was written by\u00a0Gary Myers and is due out later this month. \n \nAs for Ryan and Brady, the two will meet this week as the Bills face the Patriots. Ryan may have swapped teams, but he'll likely try his devious mind games once again.", "source": "Sporting News"}
