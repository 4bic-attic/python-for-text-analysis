It shows the fantastic scale and fantastic interest and we will have a brilliant attendance. \n\r \n\u201cThere are still tickets available, in fact 40,000 are still available.\u00a0 Another great success has been our ticket reselling platform. We\u2019ve had 55,000 sold in a safe and secure way, which is a great success and first for this tournament.\u201d \n\r \nMeanwhile, World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset dismissed the notion that the next edition in 2019 could be moved because of concerns over the scrapping of Tokyo\u2019s planned stadium. \n\r \nThe high-cost venue was to be the centrepiece of the first ever Rugby World Cup in Asia in four years\u2019 time and would also play a part in the Olympics in 2020. \n\r \nBut plans for the stadium were scrapped earlier this year due to the rising costs (believed to be around $2bn). Lapasset, however, insisted the tournament would go ahead as planned. \n\r \n\"We have no Plan B for 2019,\u201d he said. \"We are very confident of working with Japan. It is four years to go now, and time to complete the process.\u201d", "source": "ISportConnect"}
