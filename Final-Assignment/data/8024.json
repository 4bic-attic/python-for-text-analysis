Jon Hamm finally won the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series tonight at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. \"There has been a terrible mistake, clearly. Thank you for that,\" the Mad Men star said, looking somewhat stunned and a little bit relieved, in accepting the first win for himself and in any acting category for the critically acclaimed AMC show, which signed off after seven seasons this year.
