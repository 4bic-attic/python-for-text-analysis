Employees have said that the combination of premiums, co-pays and out of pocket costs are becoming a burden and are exceeding amounts that they can afford. \n \n\u201cMany employees or 53% are still choosing a major medical plan based on factors that may have little to do with the total cost of care for which they are increasingly responsible,\u201d he said. \n \nSome workers are turning to high deductible plans to help defray some of the costs, with 46% of employees who selected a major health insurance plan with a high deductible of $1,000 or more last year, up from 34% who said the same in 2014, according to the survey. \n    next   last \u00bb", "source": "Joshua Star"}
