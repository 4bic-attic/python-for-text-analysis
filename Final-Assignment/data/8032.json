My flight the next day wasn't until late in the afternoon so I spent the day at KS Productions to give support to Julie Booth and Susan Edmonson. \u00a0Susan did a fabulous job filming her segments. \u00a0Such beautiful pieces by Susan! \u00a0And of course, I LOVED her prayer flags. \u00a0As soon as Vivika saw them she called me over - \"LOOK! They are so beautiful!\" \u00a0I had to get photos so that I could post them over on The Prayer Flag Blog.\u00a0 There are a few more over on the blog so be sure to pop over and see them.\nSusan Purney Mark, Julie Booth and I took a Printed Fabric Bee photo while Julie was waiting her turn. \u00a0Vivika referred to us as a swarm. \u00a0I look like a crazy woman. \u00a0Hahaha Finally it was Julie's turn to set up. Then a few promo shots. \u00a0Then time to film! And one last shot: Susan Brubaker Knapp's quilts waiting for her to film her workshop. \u00a0I just love Susan's thread work and quilting! \u00a0I know there will be a lot I can learn from her upcoming workshop. I hope you enjoyed the photos and are excited for QATV 1700 and 1800. I know I am!", "source": "Something About Nothing"}
