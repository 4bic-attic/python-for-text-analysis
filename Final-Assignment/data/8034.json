Nobody looks at the increased cost of health insurance, gas, food and everything else; they only look at how to raise taxes. \n \nIt\u2019s all about them, not about the taxpayers. \n \nWe need to start finding ways to take some of the burden off the taxpayers at all levels of government. The county, school board and the state need to realize you just can\u2019t keep raising property taxes to fund everything. You need to look for ways to cut cost. \n \nThe commissioners\u2019 open letter in The Indiana Gazette on July 23 stated that Pennsylvania law prohibits the county, municipalities and school district from receiving a windfall in increased tax dollars after a reassessment. Then where does the money go? \n \nI also read that one of our local politicians said that there is nothing he could do about the reassessment. Excuse me, but you represent the people of Indiana County, and you are our voice in Harrisburg. \n \nTell Gov. Wolf that the people of Indiana County are tired of being taxed to the point that they are about to lose their homes, or would you rather wait to see how many people do lose their homes three to four years from now? \n \nJeff DeBar \n \nIndiana \n       \n Disclaimer: Copyright \u00a9 2015 Indiana Gazette.
