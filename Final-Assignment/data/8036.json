She faces a sentence of 2 1/3 to seven years in prison under terms of a plea deal reached with prosecutors this summer. \n\nShe pleaded guilty to charges related to providing tools to Richard Matt and David Sweat, who broke out of the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora on June 6. \n\nThe pair eluded more than 1,000 searchers for weeks. Matt was killed by a border agent June 26. Sweat was wounded and captured by a trooper two days later. \n\nMitchell admitted to becoming close with the pair and agreed to be their getaway driver before backing out at the last moment.", "source": "WWNY TV 7"}
