All the rest honestly does not concern me much.\n\n\"Realistically people come to watch football and all the rest is a little bit secondary. What is important is the quality of what we will see tomorrow morning at 12.45 and you want people to focus on that.\" \n\nAsked if he would shake Mourinho's hand and if he regretted their touchline bust-up, Wenger replied: \"I don't want to talk about that. I have nothing more to say about this situation.\"\n\nWenger was asked if he felt Chelsea were in decline. He replied: \" I don't know, I leave that to the specialists. I take care of my team and my own problems.\" \n\nCopyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Harrogate Advertiser"}
