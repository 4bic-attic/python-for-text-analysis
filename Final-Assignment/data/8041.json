The spokesperson said the Modi government had also changed names of two awards \u2013 \u2018Indira Gandhi Raj Bhasha Purushkar\u2019 and \u2018Rajiv Gandhi Rashtriya Gian-Vigyan Pustak Lekhan Purshkar\u2019 by removing names of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. \u201cComing on the heels of blatantly partisan move of diluting the essence of Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, this is yet again a black-hearted attempt to sidestep and expunge a powerful legacy of sacrifice and selfless nation building that is alien to BJP-RSS,\u201d Surjewala said. He said the Congress would take to the streets against the \u201cblatantly partisan revisionism\u201d. An RTI query by the Indian Express has revealed that the stamps featuring the two prime ministers launched by the Department of Posts in December 2008, as part of its series `Builders of Modern India\u2019, has been discontinued. A Communications and IT ministry official said that \u201comissions and additions\u201d from an old series of stamp was a process and \u201cnothing political\u201d should be read into the move. \u201cThere are additions and deletions with the introduction of a new series,\u201d the official said. The news report also said that the Department of Posts was launching another series \u2018Makers of India\u2019 which will have 24 stamps featuring prominent personalities and a stamp on yoga. It said that only four personalities \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mother Teresa and B.R. Ambedkar, who featured in `Builders of Modern India\u2019 series will be part of the new series. The Congress spokesperson said like other great nation builders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, B.R. Ambedkar, Rajendra Prasad, Subhash Chandra Bose and Lal Bahadur Shashtri, both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi shall always live in the hearts of people of the country. \u201cThey are, indeed, a part of the soul and essence that symbolizes India,\u201d Surjewala said, adding people need to be told how Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi led the country from one achievement to another and had strived for India\u2019s unity and made the supreme sacrifice. \u201cThey were not leaders of the Congress alone but leaders of the nation and its people,\u201d Surjewala said. \u201cCongress strongly condemns painful and poisonous attempts of Modi government at revising and rewriting India\u2019s legacy of service and sacrifice. People of this country will not let this government get away with lowly politics of revenge,\u201d Surjewala added.
