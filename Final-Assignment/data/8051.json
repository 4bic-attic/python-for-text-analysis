Intelligent power switches are used for high side and low side configurations and are designed for handling normal overload conditions in addition to several extraordinary conditions. Intelligent power switches find their application in automotive, industrial and commercial sectors. \n\nIn Intelligent power switches, a control section and power stage are integrated on the same chip. The control section includes drivers, logic interface, protection and diagnostic features. Intelligent Power Switches provides benefits such as cost effectiveness, compactness increased system reliability and over temperature protection. \n\nRequest Full TOC: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/6367 \n\nOn the basis of type, the intelligent power switches market can be segmented as high side switches and low side switches. High-side switches are used to drive capacitive, inductive and resistive loads and provide protection against over temperature, short circuit and overload. High-side switches are used in all kinds of industrial as well as automotive applications. Low side switches are used to drive resistive and inductive loads and it provide protection against over current, over/under voltage and over temperature. Low side power switches are used in automotive, industrial and commercial applications. \n\nIntelligent power switches market can also be segmented on the basis of the application. This includes automotive, industrial, commercial and construction application. Intelligent power switches are used in a various automotive electrical systems such as the solenoid and valve driver, in safety features such as window lifters, windshield wipers and power seats. In Industrial applications, intelligent power switches are used where intelligent protection and gate drivers provide component and space saving such as vending machines and traffic signs. Intelligent power switches also find their application in hydraulic valve control, safety relay replacement, flap driver of construction, commercial and agriculture vehicles. \n\nThe global intelligent power switches market is expected to witness robust growth through 2025 due to rising demand of intelligent power switches in automotive and industrial application across a globe. Region wise the global intelligent power switches market is classified into North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa (MEA). China is leading the intelligent power switches market in terms of manufacturing. Increasing use of intelligent power switches into automotive and industrial applications is expected to drive the growth of intelligent power switches market throughout the forecast period. Benefits of intelligent power switch such compactness, high reliability and cost effectiveness further expected to drive the market growth. \n\nRequest a Brochure of this Report: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/6367 \n\nThe key international players operating in intelligent power switches market includes RICOH Electronic Devices Co., Ltd., International Rectifier, STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies AG, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated., ROHM Semiconductor, Fuji Electric Co.
