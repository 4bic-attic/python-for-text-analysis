On the other, Sunderland seems a less-than-ideal fit. \n\nYedlin\u2019s replacement in Seattle, Tyrone Mears, unwittingly detailed the Seattle native\u2019s predicament in an interview earlier this season. Mears spent the bulk of his English club career playing for clubs like Sunderland \u2014 Derby County, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers \u2014 for which avoiding relegation was always the primary goal. \n\nMears\u2019 attack-minded game, even more similar to Yedlin\u2019s when he was a younger player with fresher legs, didn\u2019t always translate well. \n\n\u201cThe problem I was that, going to the teams that I went to in the Premier League, those teams were fighting for survival,\u201d Mears said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really about pretty, attacking play. They wanted big, strong defenders. \n\n\u201cI wanted to get to that next level, that next jump, and it never quite came. I felt that if I could have made that jump, then my game would have been more appreciated. \n\n\u201d \n\nYedlin wants to push forward, to overlap and show off his much-improved crossing skills. Dirk Advocaat\u2019s Sunderland are off to a 0-2-2 start to the new season and have been bleeding goals throughout. \n\nA loan out to a Championship contender in the second division or a recently rumored move to Denmark might have made more sense on paper, but that\u2019s a moot point now. Yedlin is heading to the North East, to the club where fellow USMNT\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
