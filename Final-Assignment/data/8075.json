Not even a snicker? \u00a0Well, I liked it. Ohh, you honestly think that pun was stupid? \u00a0Okay, maybe it was not that funny. \u00a0I chuckled, but it is okay if you can't make light of the situation. \u00a0Maybe its not funny. \u00a0I mean, someone is going to jail. \u00a0I guess that is not really funny. \u00a0 \nI am glad the judge did what he did. \u00a0I am also proud of the Supreme Court for not getting involved. \u00a0The Davis side applied for an emergency stay from the Supreme Court and it was rejected without comment. \u00a0This is an important note to the whole affair. \u00a0I do not know how many justices would have to agree to grant a stay, but the votes were not there none the less. \u00a0 \nThis whole situation opens up a giant can of stinky worms. \u00a0I can hear the 700 Club go off on this now. \u00a0I can predict what Pat Robertson will say even before he says it. \u00a0It will go something like this: \" People, you need to wake up to what is going on in America. \u00a0They are putting Christians in jail for exercising their religion. \u00a0Call our Hotline and make a donation today, you can help us end this madness. \u00a0With your $200 gift, we will send you our Free Kim Davis Emergency Packet. \u00a0Call Now. \u00a0Your help is desperately needed. \u00a0All major credit cards are accepted.\" \n \nAnd people will call and people will donate, in large quantities. \u00a0I can promise you that every Evangelical in America is going to take this as a call to arms. \u00a0The longer she stays in jail, the bigger her martyrdom is going to get. \u00a0This will not end soon. \u00a0When a Religious Right person honestly believes they are doing the right thing, then there really is not going to be any backing down. \u00a0This might take a long, long time to sort out. \u00a0", "source": "Daily Kos"}
