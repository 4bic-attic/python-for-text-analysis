But he appealed the verdict and under North Carolina law was then allowed to have a jury trial.\n\nThe domestic violence charges were then dropped in February when Holder could not be found to testify.\n\nHardy, 27, will be eligible to return to action on Oct. 11 when the Cowboys host the New England Patriots.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Ginsburg in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": "1440 WNFL"}
