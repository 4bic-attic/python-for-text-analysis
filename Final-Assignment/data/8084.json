Announcements and Implementations Updox debuts Direct email, patient surveys, digital faxing, appointment reminders, and a patient portal for Greenway Health\u2019s Prime Suite and Intergy solutions. Centro de Salud Medico Duarte (PR) implements IPatientCare\u2019s EHR at its family medicine practice in Puerto Rico. Greenway Health adds ViiMed, developer of the Surgical Coordinator Console for surgery provider groups, to its Marketplace of partner products. Government and Politics Wisconsin State Assemblyman Warren Petryk pens his support for the state\u2019s likely ratification of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, making it the 12th state to join after Iowa. Petryk, who helped draft the legislation, sees the compact as vital to the state\u2019s ability to more easily attract qualified physicians to its rural areas including his own district. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) tours Chicago-based healthcare tech incubator Matter in an effort to better understand the role up-and-coming entrepreneurs are playing in healthcare\u2019s shift to value-based care. As a member of the Senate HELP Committee, Kirk has been working to draft the Healthier Innovations for America Bill, the Senate\u2019s counterpart to the House\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act. Kirk had the opportunity to chat with Matter CEO Steven Collens and the founders of MedMatch, a new technology for hiring medical professionals, and mental health app SuperBetter. Vermont joins the rest of the nation in allowing the electronic prescription of controlled substances, a move seen by many as key to fighting opioid abuse. Surescripts CEO Tom Skelton was quick to follow up the news with a call for physicians to visit www.getEPCS.com, a resource developed by the company that aims to educate MDs on how to leverage healthcare technology for EPCS. The DoD will partner with private industry and academia to fund a new Silicon Valley-based innovation center focused on developing \u201cflexible hybrid electronics,\u201d including advanced sensors for use in new wearable devices and health-monitoring technologies. People Renowned neurologist and author Oliver Sacks passes away at the age of 82 after battling cancer. Sacks is perhaps best known (at least for those of my generation) for his 1973 book Awakenings, which was then turned into a 1990 movie starring Robin Williams. Sacks seems to have been one of the first physicians to turn his expertise towards the intellectual limelight, a role his peers (and his father) were not entirely comfortable with, and which undoubtedly paved the way for media-friendly physicians like Dr. Oz and Eric Topol, MD. Former Green Bay Packer and 1997 Super Bowl champ John Michels, MD joins Physician Partners of America affiliate Texas Pain Relief Group. Research and Innovation Just in time for Greenway Health\u2019s Engage UGM comes new Black Book Research findings that put the company\u2019s EHR at the top of the rankings for primary care EHRs, as well as customer satisfaction for the subsets of general practice and family practice. PCC ranked first in pediatrics, while AmazingCharts took top marks for geriatric primary care. Another interesting finding from the study: 70 percent of PCPs who implemented their first EHR before 2012 are more satisfied than those who implemented within the last two years. Perhaps vendors have felt compelled by market forces and government regulations to soup up their solutions with too many click-inducing bells and whistles, leading to lower customer satisfaction stats. Telemedicine ATA is accepting presentation abstracts for its 2016 meeting and tradeshow, happening May 14-17 in Minneapolis. Submissions are due September 14. The Alabama Medical Board suspends its telemedicine rules requiring initial visits between a patient and physician to be in-person. The ATA, which notes Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas have the strictest telemedicine delivery regulations, attributes the move to the state\u2019s fear of violating antitrust laws. UnitedHealthcare rolls out dermatology telemedicine services to its Medicaid members in Hawaii. Other USA Today points to the progress the City of New Orleans has made in digitizing and increasing access to its healthcare system in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, paying special attention to the progress made by community clinics. The city went from 18 pop-up clinics in its most underserved neighborhoods immediately after Katrina to investing a $100 million federal grant into building a network of 70 community clinics that handle 100,000 patients annually \u2013 all equipped with EHRs and computerized billing and patient-tracking systems. \"[We\u2019re] still growing,\u201d notes Charlotte Parent, director of the New Orleans Health Department. \u201cNo one wants to have a disaster to make changes. But we took advantage and we\u2019re really proud of where we are after 10 years.\u201d Contacts Jennifer,\u00a0 Mr. H, Lorre, Dr. Jayne, Dr. Gregg, Lt. Dan More news: HIStalk, HIStalk Connect.
