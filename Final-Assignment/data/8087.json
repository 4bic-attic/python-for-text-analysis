Richard Okechukwu is the Project Coordinator of International Institute for Tropical Agriculture IITA and the British American Tobacco Nigeria Foundation BATNF on Cassava Project In this interview with selected journalists he spoke on the Cassava Project and the need for a sustained public-private sector initiative in driving the nation\u2019s agricultural revolution and the need for government to sustain policies that are pro-agriculture among other issues Seyi Taiwo-Oguntuase was there Okechukwu How would you describe the partnership between IITA and BATNF so far\n\nIt has been very complementary First at IITA we are technical experts and we always interact with farmers We always listen to their complaints about what they would love to do and what they would love to achieve From our findings one major thing they have always lacked is the resources to getting inputs that they require to implement the technical knowledge they have acquired from the different trainings we have given to them\n\nUnderstanding that the main challenge confronting smallholder farmers is lack of resources to transform their farming operations BATN Foundation stepped in to fill this gap by providing unique opportunity for these smallholder farmers to have access to the right inputs that cover everything from land preparation planting materials technical resource persons to be on ground herbicides and fertilizers\n\nSo what is left is the actualization of these findings and results that we have got so far have been positive It is no longer business as usual\n\nAs partners IITA will ensure that every missing gap like marketing forming of cooperatives group dynamics conflict resolution between crop farmers and livestock farmers and all those kinds of hiccups are all addressed\n\nFor how long has this partnership on the distribution scheme been on The collaboration started in 2014 and this is the second cycle We just rounded off Cycle One and we are about moving to Cycle Two where we believe that the cooperatives will be registered And from the sales of some of their farm produce they will pay back a certain percentage of this loan into their cooperative account By so doing it will be easy for them to manage the Cycle Two Also by the time they sell these farm produce in 2016 they will be able to save up more money for the sustenance of this initiative\n\nAnother good thing about this is that these farmers are also linked to where they will sell their cassava roots\n\nAre there lessons to be learnt from this partnership between BATNF and IITA\n\nYes there are lessons to be learnt A very good example is that agriculture requires patience and sustained support For any smallholder farmer to do any business there has to be some sort of subsidy There has to be some sort of support to enable him move forward In advanced countries smallholder farmers receive subsidies regularly Even when they produce and there is a glut government will buy it Farmers here in Nigeria don\u2019t have any coverage\n\nThe lesson here is that of a foundation that is looking at agriculture and must be targeting this issue of sustainability so that when you give the fund you should come back to see how they are faring and also see better ways you can support them not that you should finish and go It\u2019s a very good lesson that is being learnt here\n\nWhat impact has this scheme had on the numerous benefitting families in terms of improving their productivity in subsidiary farming\n\nAs of the time we came in 2014 we found that many of these farmers didn\u2019t really know what a hectare of land is Many of them were mixing their crops planting up to four types of crops on a piece of land which is primarily subsistence farming Any farmer you see doing that is just looking for what to eat and how to survive They were not thinking business Right now there is a big shift You will find out that their yields have gone up from those seven tons in a year to 2021 tons But we want to push these yields to over 25 tons\n\nIn what areas do you think government and the organized private sector can render more support\n\nGovernment\u2019s responsibility is basically policies They must sustain policies that are pro-agriculture that are capable of empowering indigenous production\n\nAlso certain things like feeder roads tractor hiring services some basic water management systems empowerment of the youths and soft loans for farmers are areas governments can come in to motivate farmers It is very important that these things are put in place in very good strategic places\n\nThe private sector firms are willing to participate but there is no way they can pay for the cost of everything But once they find out that a good arrangement is in place a lot of people from the private sector will love to come into that line of business because they need these raw materials for their production\n\nMost of the starches we use in this country are imported We can endeavour to produce starch from our cassava maize cocoyam and Irish potatoes for local consumption We will not be importing any of these things anymore\n\nThe high quality cassava flour has become so useful today especially in the production of bread Wheat on the other hand is so expensive The high quality cassava flour has to be sustained\n\nMost companies in Nigeria often direct their corporate social investments towards providing social amenities welfare support among others are you satisfied with this kind of CSI in the area of agricultural support\n\nSincerely I will tell you that most companies will like to go to places where they will have quick visibility They always like to go to where they will have immediate results Very few people like this long-term approach and agriculture is long-term business that requires patience For a company to thread this line there is some sincerity in helping people to grow This is one very good thing I love about working with the BATN Foundation\n\nYes the big ones are okay but agriculture needs something longer If you are going to intervene in agriculture you have to be there for a longer time You have to be there to balance things\n\nFrom IITA\u2019s perspective what is the future of this scheme\n\nThe future is big Now Nigerians are realizing that agriculture is the way The former minister of agriculture Dr Akinwunmi Adesina harped on this So IITA is fully on ground to support this process And we will pool all our resources and technical knowledge together to make sure we support anybody who makes agriculture move forward not only to produce food but also to make money while producing the food\n\nWe have to make sure that we look at the entire value chain from the market to the production and most especially the young ones the youth they are our focus We need to get more and more people involved in this process There is nothing we can\u2019t produce in this country that there is no machine or expertise to do it We must not continue to be the country that produces the raw materials for others to use\n\nWhat is the future of IITA\n\nWell the future is very bright IITA will continue to push its mandate to make sure that millions of our people are pulled out of poverty We also want to make sure that at least 115 million hectares of our soil is turned to fertile soil A lot of the soils you find here have been so degraded and that is why we push for different technologies to make the soil better If the soil dies then the problem will be worsened",
