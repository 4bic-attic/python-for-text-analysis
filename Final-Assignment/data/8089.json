Without enough diapers, parents may change diapers less frequently or dry out diapers for re-use, unintentionally exposing babies to health risks, including rashes and infections. \n\nThere are 5.3 million children 1 living in low-income households, and these parents face a number of challenges, but one that is often overlooked is diaper need. Without a sufficient supply of disposable diapers, many children can't attend daycare and parents may not be able to return to work or school. \n\nHealthy Mom&Baby,\u00a0which is published by the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric & Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), connects nurses with families throughout the country through its Wipe Out Diaper Need campaign. Nurses are on the frontlines of care for women and infants.\u00a0 They often see and respond to the needs of the most vulnerable patients\u2014babies and their families\u2014 in their own communities by donating diapers to local diaper banks. \n\nTo date, Healthy Mom&Baby has raised 50 percent of its Wipe Out Diaper Need campaign goal of donating 100,000 diapers to families in need. Huggies promise to match diaper for diaper will double the campaign's efforts, rallying more parents and nurses to donate. \n\n\"Huggies is making a huge difference in helping to wipe out diaper need,\" said AWHONN CEO, Lynn Erdman, MN, RN, FAAN. \"Nurses, together with diaper banks and Huggies, are helping improve the health of infants and toddlers by addressing this important issue.\" \n\nHow to Get Involved \nDonations can be made at DiaperDrive.org and the campaign culminates during Diaper Need Awareness Week, September 28, 2015 through October 4, 2015 . \nDonate Dollars.
