So when people ask me for help, I automatically want to say \u201cyes.\u201d It\u2019s easy to end up with no margin in your life if you say \u201cyes\u201d to everyone and everything all of the time. I know this. \n \nBut it\u2019s hard to say \u201c no .\u201d It doesn\u2019t feel good. It often feels like you deny someone the help that they need, especially when you know you can make a difference. \n \nBy saying \u201cyes\u201d to everything, or everyone that asks for something from you, you are saying \u201cno\u201d to the most important things in your life. You can mistakenly swap your priorities for everyone else\u2019s priorities because you don\u2019t want to tell them \u201cno.\u201d \n \nBefore you give up the time you need for your priorities, ask yourself these questions. \n  Is this something that is aligned with my priorities now ? If what you are being asked to do is aligned with your highest priorities, it makes sense to say \u201cyes.\u201d But that isn\u2019t often the case or none of us would be as busy as we are now. If what you are being asked to do isn\u2019t aligned with your highest priorities, you shouldn\u2019t invest your limited time there.  Is this something that might be better suited for someone else because it is aligned with their priorities? A lot of the time you are asked to do something that isn\u2019t for you, but is perfect for someone you know. Sales technology companies continually ask me for help bringing their products to market. That isn\u2019t my space, and it isn\u2019t aligned with my priorities at all. But I have a friend, Miles Austin , who has that very outcome as his highest priority. A \u201cno\u201d from me is a \u201cyes\u201d for Miles. You create a lot of value connecting people who need each other.  Do I have the margin to say \u201cyes\u201d without putting my priorities at risk? Look, if you have the margin to help people without sacrificing your real priorities, by all means say \u201cyes.\u201d But remember that when you say \u201cyes\u201d to small things you are saying \u201cno\u201d to bigger things. Saying \u201cyes\u201d to small things is never a good tradeoff. Most of us are too busy because our lives are cluttered with way too many small things that we feel we have to do. If you think I am wrong, just look at all of the emails in your inbox. Saying \u201cno\u201d protects the margin you need for the things that mean the most to you.   \nYou can\u2019t ask yourself if your help would be valuable. If you are being asked, it is because the person asking believes your help is valuable. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should say \u201cyes.\u201d \n \nRobin Dunbar\u2019s research suggests that human beings are capable of maintaining roughly 150 relationships. Some people might be able to maintain 225, but they are the rare exceptions. If you haven\u2019t read Gene O\u2019Kelley\u2019s Chasing Daylight , pick it up. You\u2019ll quickly realize that the small circle of friends and family are what\u2019s most important in life. And then you\u2019ll start finding a way to give yourself more time for what matters most. \n \n\n \nThe post Saying No to Small Things appeared first on The Sales Blog .", "source": "The Sales Blog"}
