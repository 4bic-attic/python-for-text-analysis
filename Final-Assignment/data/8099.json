That same technology has now been applied to a line of wheeled-luggage that includes a suitcase and a carry-on. ClubGlider Suitcase offers the same ease of use as the golf travel bag thanks to the extendable leg that supports 100% of the weight and then simply retracts away for travel. The suitcase is constructed with the same highly durable, ballistic-style nylon as the ClubGlider Meridian golf travel bag. The ClubGlider Carry-On coordinates with the suitcase and is sized to fit in airplane overhead bins. Both pieces are available now at $349.99 for the suitcase and $239.99 for the carry-on. \n \nThe ease of using a ClubGlider golf travel bag has changed how people travel with their clubs.
