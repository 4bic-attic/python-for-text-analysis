The Irish Times\u00a0reported that Irish-language activist group Misneach is organizing a protest at the social network\u2019s Dublin headquarters over its real-name policy\u00a0and the way it has been enforced against users opting to use their Irish-language names. A Misneach told The Irish Times many Facebook users decide to use their Irish names after joining the social network, but they cannot produce the official documentation required by Facebook, such as birth certificates, driver\u2019s licenses or non-government ID. The issue is also the subject of a petition on Change.org, which had tallied more than 600 signatures at the time of this post. According to The Irish Times, the protest is scheduled for 2 p.m. local time Oct. 7. Readers: What are your thoughts on Facebook\u2019s real-name policy?", "source": "SocialTimes Feed"}
