In 2014, as part of an annual monitoring program started nearly 20 years ago, university researchers identified SDS as the second-leading disease causing soybean crop loss. With access to the latest scientific research, industry papers and agricultural resources, SoySDS will help inform growers about all facets of SDS, including its impact and how they can protect themselves from this serious threat. \n\nSudden Death Syndrome has evolved from an isolated and virtually unknown disease in 1971 to be the cause of more than 60 million bushels in lost yield last year . In fact, two of the three largest outbreaks of SDS in the Midwest have occurred within the past five years, suggesting that this disease is here to stay. Understanding the disease and its progression has never been more important, as growers look to protect their crop from this yield-robbing pest. \n   \nAt www.soysds.com , growers will have access to a host of educational resources that will provide a complete overview of the disease and its impact; helping them to develop a management strategy for reducing potential production risk. Comprised of third-party insights and proprietary research, including reports from researchers at Iowa State University , Purdue University , University of Wisconsin-Madison , among others, original articles and instructional images, www.soysds.com , serves as a one-stop repository for anyone seeking valuable information on SDS.\u00a0 \n\n\"With www.soysds.com , we will provide the agricultural community with the premiere destination for all-things SDS,\" said Kevin Adam , SeedGrowth Strategic Business Lead, Bayer CropScience. \"Before growers can make management decisions, it is important that they understand the basic biology of the disease, what to look for to identify the disease in their fields and effective management options to prevent yield loss. With this site, Bayer CropScience will provide growers with easy access to the latest academic research papers conducted by university experts and tools to ensure they have the most current information on SDS and how to management it.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nFor more information regarding solution options visit https://www.bayercropscience.us/products/seedgrowth/ilevo . \n\nBayer CropScience Twitter Page:\u00a0 \nhttp://twitter.com/bayer4cropsus  \nhttp://twitter.com/bayerbeecare  \n\nBayer CropScience Blog: \nhttp://connect.bayercropscience.us \n\nBayer CropScience is committed to bringing new technology and solutions for agriculture and non-agricultural uses.
