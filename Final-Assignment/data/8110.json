Inevitably, generational divides and stout beliefs come into play, but the focus is always on who gets to say it and why. We then debate about whether these debates, as prevalent as the word itself, are even worth having. They definitely are, especially when done fluently, so you had to expect there\u2019d be a \u201cNigga Episode\u201d at some point in the history of Black-ish and it came last night in a solid episode titled \u201cTHE Word.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s Season 2 premiere tackled \u201cnigga\u201d like any regular Black-ish viewer might assume it would\u2014with a careful measure of edginess, discretion and comedy. For any show to masterfully wrestle with a word like this requires a level of nuance and litheness that Blackish simply isn\u2019t afforded as a primetime series. It\u2019s even harder to pull off, when there\u2019ve been countless academic discussions, theses and standup sets about it. Blackish, per its norm, aimed for diplomacy in an episode that again brought in dialogue that black people have been having forever. As overly routine as they are, the recycling of these age-old topics are still, in a way, a mark of community. With the acknowledgement that this family series can\u2019t stretch to Pryor-level \u201cnigga\u201d analysis (as \u201ca word that\u2019s used to describe our own wretchedness\u201d), given its network limitations, last night\u2019s episode impressed and pushed the boundaries just enough.\nAdvertisement The story is framed around the youngest son Jack, who says \u201cnigga\u201d at a school talent showcase while performing, of all songs, Kanye West\u2019s \u201cGold Digger.\u201d There\u2019s a sly moment after Dre\u2019s signature opening monologue\u2014which is this time about the contextual history of \u201cnigga\u201d\u2014as he sets the scene. \u201cSome people have said it and it made big news,\u201d he narrates. \u201cSometimes it comes from exactly the places you\u2019d expect. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Cut to a little white girl on stage recalling her granddaddy, who lives on a tobacco plantation in South Carolina, telling her \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with this country.\u201d For a minute, you think she\u2019s about to slip up.\u201d The answer is \u201cNothing.\u201d Jack then takes the stage and shows off his dance moves, which include what has to be one the top-five cutest versions of the Nae Nae on Earth. He approaches the mic and starts rapping, \u201cNow I ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 she a gold digger/ But she ain\u2019t messin\u2019 with no broke nigga\u201d and repeats the line for effect. Everything comes to a halt. Diane (aka me) shakes her head and says, \u201cBegged him to go with the radio edit.\u201d Blackish creator Kenya Barris told Vulture of this moment:\n\u201cWe really wanted malice not to be a part of it \u2014 it immediately took you out of the ugliness of it. He wasn\u2019t being ugly or malicious. It\u2019s a kid saying a word. My kids go to private school and hate speech has been given zero tolerance, and I think that\u2019s great and really important. Once you\u2019re able to see that he didn\u2019t have malice about it, it opens you up to the conversation a lot more.\u201d We see that \u201cnigga\u201d is uttered, but it\u2019s bleeped out, and the character\u2019s mouths are blurred whenever it\u2019s mentioned. Barris says, \u201cThe bleep in a weird way makes you hear it even louder. But it still allows you to get into the drama and the comedy of the scene without making you feel ostracized.\u201d With his performance, Jack has violated the school\u2019s zero tolerance policy of \u201cno hate speech\u201d (which Rainbow helped create) and he now faces expulsion. The principal delivering the news is a black man with whom Dre assumes rapport\u2014he calls him \u201cyoung Denzel\u201d and \u201cmy nigga,\u201d invoking Training Day. While Rainbow goes on a mission to appeal to the school board, Dre defends Jack\u2019s right to say \u201cnigga\u201d to anyone who\u2019ll listen. \u201cDammit, it\u2019s his birthright!\u201d he screams. Rainbow\u2019s philosophy is that the word is hateful and shouldn\u2019t be said by anyone. The generational divide is blatant. Pops, of course, a veteran of hypocrisy, both thinks it\u2019s an abomination and also uses it regularly. The \u201cnigga\u201d discussion bleeds over as the show goes at it from different angles: black people\u2019s usage, white people\u2019s usage, older people\u2019s disapproval, usage in \u201cmixed company\u201d (where the lines get dangerous), and young people\u2019s flippant approach. When Dre learns that his oldest daughter Zoey gives her white friends a pass on saying it, he flips out. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s not like they mean anything by it. It\u2019s just a word.\u201d Impressively, the writers manage to fit tons of (again, recycled) commentary into moments like that, and especially in Dre\u2019s rants. When Dre tells Pops, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the white man wants. He either wants nobody to say it because he can\u2019t or everybody to say it because he wants to,\u201d it\u2019s hard not to hear echoes of dozens of people you know who\u2019ve said a variation of the same thing. Much of the humor in the episode comes when Dre has to perform the tireless and familiar act of schooling his coworkers about what\u2019s appropriate (i.e. use \u201cblack\u201d instead of \u201cAfrican-American\u201d). While in a meeting, Dre and his two black (male) coworkers Charlie and Curtis are having a separate convo (their space in this white space), with the grimacing white coworkers there as spectators\u2014the framing of the scene is telling. In a funny, over-exaggerated bit about ownership, Dre complains to his friends about not being allowed to say \u201cnigga\u201d in his home. Charlie, who\u2019s become a great tertiary character, responds, \u201cWowwww. They want you to live in a \u2018nigga\u2019-free zone.\u201d The white people are then allowed into the conversation. Their boss says he misses the word \u201ccolored\u201d and Charlie pulls out a gun and puts it on the desk. This exaggeration is needed to lighten the mood. When the boss brings up NAACP as a counterpoint, Dre says, \u201cYou know, that group been sending mixed messages for a long time.\u201d Touch\u00e9. Later, Charlie and Curtis have to break it down even further to their white coworkers with a ridiculously simple chart about who can use it (\u201cOkay to say\u201d vs. \u201cNot okay to say\u201d), mocking the idea that anything is that simple and that these explanations somehow become our burden. As one of the only shows right now where the \u201cnigga\u201d topic can even be broached, Blackish went down the middle with a PG touch and a light edge. Fittingly, Dre ends up talking in circles while defending Jack before the school board, invoking Paula Deen and Django in one long argument. Confused at this point, he says, \u201cI lost my way\u201d and blames it on blood sugar. The point, a sensible one, is not to expect this debate to be settled but to just keep talking because, as Dre says, \u201cThis whole country has been schizophrenic about what to call black people for two centuries.\u201d This episode of Blackish was far from radical; it just kept talking.
