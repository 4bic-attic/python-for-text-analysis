But know from messages we have received that some people didn\u2019t make the cut-off date,\u201d says Gwen Ansell, convener of the judges\u2019 panel. \u201cTo draw in the widest possible range of entries, we have decided to extend the date.\u201d \n\nArts writers working in mainstream, independent or community media may submit as entries portfolios of work or individual items published between 1 January 2014 and 31 July 2015. Competition categories span news, feature and review work, published in either written (print or online), photographic, multimedia or audio formats. \u201cWe are seeking a diversity of voices from a diversity of platforms,\u201d says Ansell. \u201cThis year, we are particularly keen to see bloggers broadcasters and community arts journalists entering alongside the writers normally showcased on conventional newspaper arts pages.\u201d \n\nYou can nominate yourself, but it\u2019s also open to editors, colleagues or readers to nominate an arts writer they admire, and for arts publications to enter their brand. Find full details of how to enter or nominate work for the awards, along with more information about categories and criteria on the website. \n\nClosing date for entries is Friday, 11 September. Judging will take place during September, and winners will be announced later this year. \n\nFor more information, click here .
