Now that collaboration will kick off a yearlong celebration with a festival on Oct. 10 .\u00a0 \n\nThe building that would be called ImaginOn : The Joe and Joan Martin Center , settled into a spot on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte where it welcomed curious onlookers with a festive purple, blue and green facade, and a roof that seemed to reach for the sky.\u00a0 \n\nInside, an award-winning children's library and equally renowned children's theater partnered to become a one-stop shop for education and entertainment for the community, the region and beyond. \n\nThough Spangler Children's Library , the Teen Loft and the Children's Theatre of Charlotte each have their own individual identities, together as ImaginOn , they are living proof that the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.\u00a0 \n\nOn October 10 from noon to 4 p.m. , ImaginOn will ring in its 10-year anniversary with a free, fun-filled festival that will include live performances by Liz, Holly, & The Jolly Lollies, birthday crafts, robotics and gaming, costume characters, backstage tours, and more. \n\nThe entire community is invited to participate in this kick-off to a yearlong celebration with events each month that will commemorate the anniversary. \n  \nhttp://news.cision.com/charlotte-mecklenburg-library/r/imaginon-turns-10-in-october--kicks-off-a-yearlong-celebration-with-a-festival,c9831079 \n \nhttp://news.cision.com/charlotte-mecklenburg-library/i/img10-balloons,c1747033 \n\n(c) 2015 Cision.
