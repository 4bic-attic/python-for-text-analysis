It is applicable for PCI Express, Ethernet, GbE, Synchronous Ethernet, Fibre Channel, enterprise server, telecom, test and measurement, medical and passive optical network (PON) applications, or as a clock source for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters and FPGAs. Available in output frequencies between 13,50 and 220,0 MHz, and with HCSL, LVPECL or LVDS logic, the device features low jitter and excellent power supply rejection, and has an enable/disable function.
