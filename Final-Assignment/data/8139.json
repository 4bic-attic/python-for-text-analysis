I am truly thankful to have added value to the portfolios of many traders and have taken pride in introducing new ideas to the conversation. As you can imagine, creating the game plan for each trading session has been a very time consuming and labor intensive endeavor. With that being said, I have decided to transition ChartSmarter to a subscription-based model. In order to continue reading the daily Game Plans, you will need to sign up for an account via one of the below two options. As a thank you to my loyal readers, there will be a 2 week free trial when you signup to become a subscriber. There is absolutely no commitment, and you can cancel at anytime before the end of the free trial without being charged. After the 2 week trial period, you will be automatically charged. The normal rate will now be $59.99/month or you can sign up for a year at $529.89 and get one month free. I will continue to post as I have always done with Game Plans published the night before the market opens. I am happy to answer any questions you may have via email at chartsmarterblog@gmail.com. Thank you again for your continued and overwhelming support. Douglas J.
