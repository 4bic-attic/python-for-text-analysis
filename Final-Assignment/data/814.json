But it is a key part of the economy in Saskatchewan, where the party hopes to add support. \n   \r \nThe governing Conservatives in June made an exception to the country's longstanding policy requiring uranium mines to be majority-owned by Canadian companies, and approved an application by Australia's Paladin Energy Ltd. \n   \r \nIf the left-wing NDP forms government after the Oct. 19 election, it would not change that decision, Mulcair said during a Winnipeg campaign stop. \n   \r \n\"The federal government has a responsibility to keep a very close eye on\" uranium production, he said. \"It's a strategic asset, but the (Paladin decision) seems to have opened the possibility for better investment.\" \n   \r \nRestrictions on foreign companies have reduced opportunities for companies, including Denison Mines Corp and Fission Uranium Corp, to find buyers for their planned uranium projects in Canada, the world's second-largest producer. \n   \r \nThe radioactive metal produces fuel for reactors. \n   \r \nThe Conservative government has said Paladin was unable to find a Canadian partner for its project in Newfoundland and Labrador. Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corp is the main owner of all of the country's uranium mines.\n\u00a0 Continued...", "source": "Reuters Canada"}
