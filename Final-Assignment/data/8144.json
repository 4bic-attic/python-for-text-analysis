Find more details at\u00a0www.garlicfestct.com TAKE A TRIP TO ICELAND One woman's love affair with Iceland was the spark that began this unusual festival. Gerri Griswold, a former chef and current broadcaster, visited the \"land of fire and ice\" and fell in love. She has made over a dozen trips to Iceland since 2002 and in 2009, decided to introduce more Americans to their northern neighbor in what she thought would be a one-time event in her home town. Instead, the Iceland Affair keeps growing. At this year's fifth edition at Winchester Center's Grange Hall visitors will hear experts talk about Iceland's arts and amazing nature, see prize photography of the land's lavish geysers and waterfalls, and will be able to sample authentic Icelandic foods such as goat sausage, smoked and dried fish, sensational chocolates and licorice, the special local yogurt known as skyr, pure Icelandic water, and what Griswold calls the best hot dogs in the world. On the Winchester Center Green the public will meet Iceland's biologically pure animals including Icelandic horses, sheep, sheep dogs, and chickens. The event will be held on October 18 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. All the day's activities are free. \u00a0For details on the festival, see\u00a0http://icelandaffair.com.", "source": "Travel in Connecticut's Litchfield Hills and Fairfield County"}
