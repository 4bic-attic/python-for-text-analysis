The Vungle Score, as its name suggests, gives apps a score based on \u201creal-time app performance data, including reach, volume and conversions,\u201d\nper Vungle. \n \nThe Vungle Billboard is where those scores will be accessible to advertisers. Vungle notes that the billboard automatically adds apps \u201cas they rise in popularity\u201d and\n\u201cremoves apps as their usage dwindles.\u201d Other relevant data about the apps -- such as average age of the user, daily impressions, click-through rates and more -- will also be available via\nthe Billboard, as will Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings data, per a release. \n \nDigital ad agency Essence is among the first to use the new marketplace, billboard and app scores -- the bundle of which\nVungle is calling \u201cVungle Premium.\u201d \n \nThe marketplace adds a new dimension to \u201creal-time\u201d advertising. In addition to sending targeted ads via real-time bidding (RTB),\nVungle also keeps tabs on the apps themselves in real-time. \n \n\u201cIt's important to move with our audience in real time and stay relevant as new apps enter the marketplace,\u201d commented\nJolie Giuffre, mobile planning director at Essence, in a prepared statement.", "source": "Media Post"}
