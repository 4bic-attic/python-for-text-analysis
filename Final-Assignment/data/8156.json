But it was the Red Bulls who once again stood tall in the face of adversity, returning home with the first ticket to the Audi 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs \u00a0as their reward. \n \n\u201cWe had a couple of obstacles to overcome,\u201d goalkeeper Luis Robles said. \u201cThis is a good example of the belief within this team. It\u2019s about the next man on knowing they\u2019re going to be able to do well at the task but help the team succeed.\u201d \n \nThe \u201cnext man up mentality\u201d has proven its worth for this Red Bulls team. So often the squad defined by its international superstars, the collective unit has been the key in 2015. The task was as difficult as any they\u2019ve faced this season considering tired legs abounding throughout the lineup, but just as they\u2019ve done so often this season, New York found a way to get the job done. \n \n\u201cTonight was a real team performance,\u201d midfielder Sacha Kljestan said. \u201cIn the first half we played so well, we overwhelmed them and we put two unbelievable goals in. In the second half we just defended for our lives because that\u2019s when the fatigue started to kick in, but overall a great performance.\u201d \n \nReturning to the top of the Eastern Conference, the Red Bulls can breathe a sigh of relief as the first team in the league to guarantee postseason soccer. And while they are hesitant to speculate as to what glory the future might hold, there is a clear understanding their work is far from done. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important, but we\u2019re not at our goal yet,\u201d goalscorer Felipe said of New York\u2019s playoff-clinching victory. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go and we have to keep pushing, keep our foot on the gas. There\u2019s a long way to go but we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d \n \nWith the win, the Red Bulls find themselves in an enviable position on 48 points with six games still to play. Looking at their remaining schedule, fans may be dreaming of a Supporters\u2019 Shield homecoming, but head coach Jesse Marsch is taking a measured approach that has resonated throughout the squad. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s significant in the sense that we\u2019re being rewarded for continuing to believe in ourselves, but it\u2019s not really the end goal,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe have four more at home so we\u2019ve got a good stretch of home games to really push ourselves and continue to collect points, but we\u2019re going to take it one game at a time.\u201d", "source": "New York Red Bulls"}
