Vaish asked DU to take instruction on removal of prefixes \u201cA\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201cAA\u201d or further before the names of candidates and inform it by September 9. \n \nThe plea filed by AISA through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra said candidates add the alphabet \u201cA\u201d before their names with a view to get their names listed first or at the top of the ballot paper. \n \nIt contended that it was a belief that a large number of voters not committed to any particular contesting candidate but nevertheless exercising their voting right, exercise the same in favour of the candidate whose name appears first on the ballot paper without even bothering to go through all the names. \n \nIn another plea, alleging that most of the candidates in the upcoming Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) election were indulging in, abetting and practicing all \u201cillegal activities\u201d considered \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d, the court asked the grievance cell of DU to decide the representation within two days. \n \nThe plea filed by Ruby, a first-year-student of the law faculty in DU, said the candidates indulged in offences such as bribing and intimidation of voters, canvasing and holding public meetings and using propaganda outside the university or college campuses and violating the Lyngdoh Committee Report guidelines. \n \nThe court asked the grievance cell to decided Ruby\u2019s representation within two days and said that if she has any problem thereafter, she can again move the court. \n \nRinka Aggarwal, student of Ram Lal Anand College, also moved the high court against rejection of his nomination papers for contesting for the post of president of the students\u2019 body. \n \nAdvocate Satya Ranjan Swain, appearing for Aggarwal, alleged that on August 28, the student filed his nomination papers. However, his name was not there in the list of candidates which was published on September 2. \n \nThe court asked DU and the college to respond to his plea also and posted the matter for Wednesday. \n \n\u201cIn spite of having all eligibility, the rejection of his nomination papers was an arbitrary decision violating of the principles of natural justice and the Lyngdoh committee recommendations,\u201d said the plea. \n \nThe post appeared first on The Siasat Daily .", "source": "Siasat Daily"}
