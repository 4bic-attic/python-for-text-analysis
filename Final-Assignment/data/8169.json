As a feature of his training at Vienna's Stadtkonvikt, youthful Schubert got lessons from Antonio Salieri. The veteran court arranger guided his student to ponder Italian musical show, a guideline that drove Schubert to set Pietro Metastasio's 'Quell'innocente figlio'.", "source": "Blouin Artinfo"}
