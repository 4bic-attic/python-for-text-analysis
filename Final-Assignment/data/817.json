The Forest was a movie I was aware of but didn\u2019t have much of an interest due to the premise seeming somewhat generic. If I remember correctly my exact thought was \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a lot of skill to get me to watch this\u201d. Either I\u2019m much more of a pushover than I thought or this film actually has some potential. Gramercy Pictures released a trailer today and I\u2019m kinda intrigued but the hand I was dealt. Here, see for yourself: A supernatural thriller set in the legendary Aokigahara Forest at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan. A young American woman, Sara \u00a0(Natalie Dormer of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d), goes in search of her twin sister, who has mysteriously disappeared. Despite everyone\u2019s warnings to \u201cstay on the path,\u201d Sara enters the forest determined to discover the truth about her sister\u2019s fate \u2013 only to be confronted by the angry and tormented souls of the dead that prey on anyone who wanders into the forest. Now there are things that seem a little generic and you might write this one off without much thought if you\u2019ve already seen films like The Cabin in the Woods but I\u2019m a genuine Dormer Supporter. The Forest will release January 2016 so there\u2019s still plenty of time to get a clearer picture on what\u2019s in store. Source: Gramercy Pictures \u00a0", "source": "The Movie Blog"}
