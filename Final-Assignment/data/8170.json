The real Najib,\" Mr Mallott says.\n\n\"He is the domestic Najib, the man who stifles freedom. The man whose police force tear-gassed people in the streets for demanding free and fair elections \u2026 the man who arrested scores of opposition politicians and dissidents under the Sedition Act,\" he says.\n\nMr Najib, 62, who took office in 2009, is clinging to his position with the support of loyalists in his United Malays National Organisation who have benefited from the party's largesse.\n\nCritics have accused elements of UMNO of using the race card to divert attention from Mr Najib, inflaming ethnic tensions in the country where 67 per cent are Malays, most of whom are Muslims, 24 per cent are Chinese and seven per cent Indian.\n\nDemonstrators at a \"Malay on top\" rally in Kuala Lumpur on September 16 hurled insulting racial slurs at ethnic Chinese.\n\nMahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister who stepped down in 2003, says since race riots rocked the country in 1969 there has been \"some accommodation among the races\".\n\n\"But what I see today is the government encouraging racist sentiments. This is very very bad,\" he told a forum of lawyers in Malacca on Saturday, according to Malaysia Insider magazine. There have been turbulent episodes in the Canberra's relations with Kuala Lumpur, particularly during prickly Dr Mahathir's 22 year rule.\n\nBut Australia has often looked to Malaysia as a predictable and reliable friend in the region. \"Thailand is always uncertain, Indonesia is fickle, hypersensitive and difficult and the Philippines just doesn't count, really,\" Professor Kessler says. \"But we always have Malaysia to rely upon and turn to, or so we think, and so we act,\" he says.\n\n\"We became hostage to the myth of the good, benign Malaysia, the unproblematic Malaysia\u2026and they have learned to play, to their advantage, on our anxiety for regional inclusion and participation.\"\n\nProfessor Kessler says it is time for Australia to \"get started now at looking at Malaysia seriously and intelligently.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "source": "Tasmanian Examiner"}
