Dudley, of New Paris, sued the university in January 2014. Her lawsuit says course materials were inaccessible to her text-to-speech software and she hadn't received material in forms she could use without help. The lawsuit says Miami violated federal law by failing to provide equal access. \n\nThe government alleges the university has violated the American with Disabilities Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability and says the school uses technologies inaccessible to students with vision, hearing or learning disabilities. \n\nThe university denies doing anything wrong.", "source": "Charlotte Observer"}
