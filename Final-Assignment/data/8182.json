The current one is unraveling at the seams. Last week I noticed that the faucet in the staff bathroom was running very slowly. \n \n\u201cGood thing we\u2019re only here another year!\u201d I said to myself. \u201cI\u2019m not fixing that.\u201d \n \nThe next day, even less water was coming out. Markedly less water. I soaked the aerator in vinegar, but no dice. That faucet is ancient, and I fear that something large is either stuck in the faucet, or the water pipes are so gunked up, nothing will come out. We have a trustee coming, and if that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019re calling the plumber. \n \nUntil then, I have duct-taped and zip-tied the situation.", "source": "LaurenandLloyd.com"}
