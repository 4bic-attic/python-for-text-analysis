So that the hull can swell up after being out of the water for over two years during which time she as had a lot of work done on her, including a new cabin roof and cabin sides and a new cockpit coaming which are going to be fitted over the winter months. She as also had a number of planks and ribs renewed where they were either broken or rotten or in some case both.\u00a0\nSo let the fun begin tomorrow and get the jobs done and see the yacht back in the water where she belongs. Then the next stage of this project can continue over the winter months.", "source": "J-Star Boat & Marine Services Traditional Boat Builders"}
