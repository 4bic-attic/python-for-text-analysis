(InGoal photo by Scott Slingsby) Washington Capitals\u2019 netminder Justin Peters went under the knife on Monday, a procedure the club called\u00a0\u201csuccessful.\u201d In a brief news release\u00a0Washington said Peters underwent surgery on his left knee and they expected the 28-year old to be ready for training camp, though an official start date has not been announced. The Capitals first preseason game is against Florida on September 21st. Peters\u2019 agent Jordan Neumann told the Washington Post\u00a0Peters had been rehabilitating a sore knee that did not improve as expected, so they opted for surgery. \u201cI would expect he\u2019s doing everything in full gear, taking shots prior to the start of training camp,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cWe expect him to be a full participant on day one of camp.\u201d Peters played just 12 games for Washington last season \u2013 his first with the club after joining from Carolina \u2013 going 3-6-1 with a .881 save percentage and 3.25 goals against average. The Blyth, Ontario native is entering the final season\u00a0of a two-year, one-way contract worth $950,000, and will be an unrestricted free agent next summer. he is expected to compete with German prospect Phillip Grubauer for the backup role behind recently re-signed No.1 Braden Holtby. Grubauer was selected ahead of Peters during the Eastern Conference quarter finals, when starter Braden Holtby was sidelined due to illness ahead of Game 2, and the 23-year old is considered a bright\u00a0goaltending prospect. Grubauer\u2019s emergence and new one-way contract\u00a0suggest Peters may be AHL bound this season, but a return in time for training camp will at least allow him to compete for the backup role after a disappointing first year with the club.
