Welke DeMuth as second base umpire alongside crewmates Ed Hickox (PU), Paul Nauert (U1) and Mike Estabrook (U3).\nDeMuth's plaque.\nPhoto:\u00a0@awerdude13 DeMuth is just the 22nd umpire to officiate at least 4,000 Major League games. Tim Welke was the most recent umpire to accomplish the feat, calling his 4,000th on April 13, 2014. Joe West and Gerry Davis are the other active umpires to have officiated in excess of 4,000 games, with West recently passing Tom Connolly (4,768) to take over third place on the all-time list for most games officiated.\nDeMuth has appeared in three All-Star Games, nine Division Series, five Championship Series, and five World Series since his 1983 National League debut. He most recently ejected White Sox Manager Robin Ventura for arguing crewmate Nauert's no catch (safe) call on September 1, 2013.\nDeMuth, who is from Ohio, also served as one of the Major League umpires assigned to officiate the 2009 World Baseball Classic, working the WBC's Tokyo round.", "source": "Close Call Sports & Umpire Ejection Fantasy League"}
