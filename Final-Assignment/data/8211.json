The I-O RPM program focuses on significant areas of high \r\n      unmet need marked by poor outcomes among patients with rare population \r\n      malignancies. A rare population malignancy is a subpopulation within a \r\n      higher incident disease population (e.g. BRCA 1 and 2 breast cancer). \r\n      These patients have aggressive disease with an increased potential for \r\n      early metastasis to multiple sites and/or are initially refractory or \r\n      subject to early recurrences with conventional cancer therapies. \r\n      Existing clinical research provide a strong rationale for further \r\n      research into the potential of immunotherapies for these cancers.\r \n \n\r\n      The I-O RPM builds on Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s formation in 2012 of the \r\n      International Immuno-Oncology Network (II-ON). II-ON is a global \r\n      collaboration between Bristol-Myers Squibb and academia focused on \r\n      facilitating the translation of scientific research findings into \r\n      clinical trials and, eventually, clinical practice.\r \n \n\r About Bristol Myers Squibb \r \n \n\r\n      Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission \r\n      is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help \r\n      patients prevail over serious diseases.
