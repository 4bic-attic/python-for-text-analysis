Patel testified through an interpreter he didn\u2019t understand Parker\u2019s commands. \n\nParker was shown an enlarged video in slow motion of the Feb. 6 encounter and told prosecutors that he lost his balance as he was trying to take Patel down. \n\nParker says he wasn\u2019t trained to use the maneuver, but has done so before without injuring people. \n\nPatel was partially paralyzed in the fall. \n\n____ \n\n9:15 a.m. \n\nThe Alabama police officer accused of using excessive force against an Indian grandfather who testified he didn\u2019t understand commands given in English says the man reached in his pockets and defied his orders. \n\nMadison police officer Eric Parker took the stand in his own defense Wednesday in his federal trial. \n\nParker says he and 58-year-old Sureshbhai Patel (suh-REHSH\u2019-by pah-TEL\u2019) both slipped as he tried to take him to the ground.
