No one was allowed to enter the Pisgah High School main campus until it was cleared by law enforcement officials. \n\nAssociate Superintendent Bill Nolte issued a statement noting that officials were working with law enforcement and staff to safely and effectively evacuate the campus. \n\n\u201cAt this point our primary concern is safety,\" he said, promising to follow up with additional communications and investigative steps when more was known. \n\nAs parents lined up outside the stadium to pick up students early Friday afternoon, some complained that they learned about the evacuation order from their children who contacted them directly by cell phone as opposed to receiving a call from the school. \n\nAs Christy Bristow waited for her 12th grader, Cameron Jones, she said the experience was a little unnerving. \n\n\"This is the first time I've ever had to deal with something like this. It's scary, it really is scary,\" she said. \"You never think it's going to happen here because Pisgah is a really good place and a good place to have your kids. You never think in a million years that it's going to be your school, but it is,\" Bristow said. \n\nParents did not receive notification of the evacuation until around 2 p.m. \n\nGarrett was at the school, actively organizing the evacuation. She said she understood parents' frustration that they were first notified of the evacuation by students. \n\n\"There\u2019s not a kid in here who doesn\u2019t have a cell phone. Parents know faster than anybody else because kids are calling them,\" she said. \"They\u2019re doing it a lot faster than we could, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I hate that parents were notified by students first, but we did it as quickly as we possibly could.\" \n\nBy school protocol, students must first be safely evacuated before notice is sent to parents, because parents rushing to the school to pick up their children could pose a safety hazard to the safe evacuation of the buildings, Garrett said. \n\nThis is the first evacuation order in recent history for Pisgah said Garrett. \n\nBy 3 p.m., the bomb dog brought in from the Buncombe County Sheriff's office had cleared three buildings. The dog rested briefly before searching the other three. \n\nGarrett said Pisgah is following its Safe School Plan and officials are pleased with the orderly evacuation thus far. \n\n\"Steps are being followed, it's very organized, all the staff are involved, and parents have been great,\" Garrett said.", "source": "Mountaineer Publishing Company"}
