Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \n\nFar Eastern University gained headway in the best-of-three battle for third\u00a0after downing University of Santo Tomas, 25-17, 25-17, 10-25, 25-20,\u00a0Saturday\u00a0in the Shakey\u2019s V-League Season 12-Collegiate Conference at\u00a0Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan. \n\nBernadette Pons walloped the opposition with 15 hits and one service\u00a0ace while Jovelyn Gonzaga put up a defensive blockade at the net that\u00a0proved good enough to foil the Tigresses from storming back and\u00a0pushing the Lady Tamaraws to the edge.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nAfter zooming ahead in the first two sets, the Lady Tams fell\u00a0complacent in the next frame, allowing the Tigresses to stage an\u00a0onslaught through the collective efforts of Ennajie Laure, Carmela\u00a0Tunay, Jessey De Leon, Marivic Meneses and Pam Lastimosa. \n\nPons then took the initiative and conspired with Jovelyn Gonzaga,\u00a0Honey Royce Tubino and Anne Guino-o to fend off a late charge by the\u00a0Tigresses in the fourth and deciding set. \n\nGoing for the clincher\u00a0next Saturday, the Tams also squeezed the best\u00a0out of Gonzaga, who had 11 hits and three blocks while Jerrilli\u00a0Malabanan, Remy Palma, Basas, Guino-o and Royce combined for 32 hits. \n\nLaure and Lastimosa had 12 hits each during the one-hour and\u00a040-minute match that saw Tunay, De Leon and Meneses assemble 20 points\u00a0for the Tigresses. \n\nIn the other game, Emilio Aguinaldo College also seized the headstart\u00a0in its best-of-three series with National College of Business\u00a0Administration, 25-18, 25-12, 25-14, in the Spikers\u2019 Turf. \n\nHoward Mojica had 11 efficient attacks and one block in leading the\u00a0Generals but his nine service aces dealt the most punishing blows to\u00a0the Wildcats. \n\nFOLLOW INQUIRER ON: \n\nDisclaimer: Comments do not represent the views of INQUIRER.net.
