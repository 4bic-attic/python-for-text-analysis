And in the centre of it all stands Gomes herself, exuding confidence, calm and complete comfort \u2013 no mean feat in a tiny bikini. \n\n\nThat in-control vibe the 30-year-old is rocking? It hasn\u2019t always come so easy. \u201cI am so happy to say goodbye to my twenties,\u201d she admits when she sits down to chat once the lights are packed up. \n \nVideo  Behind the scenes with Jessica Gomes \n \n\u201cI used to put a lot of pressure on myself \u2013 to be a certain way or get to some goal with my training \u2013 and I think relaxing my approach has really helped me.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s hardly slacking off, though: her stellar career sees her crossing time zones regularly as she fronts up as the face of big beauty brands and iconic fashion labels. \n\nRelated: How to choose the best workout for your body \n\nIt\u2019s a busy lifestyle she says she loves, and one that\u2019s taught her \u2013 sometimes the hard way \u2013 the importance of looking after both her body and mind. \u201cI\u2019m not into crazy dieting or things that are hard to sustain,\u201d she says. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be honest with yourself and be good to yourself, and in turn you\u2019ll want to be good to your body. You will exercise, you will drink a lot of water, you will eat healthy. \n\nRelated: Seven signs a diet won't work \n\nI\u2019m all about balance. I\u2019m not saying all I drink is green juice and all I eat is organic food. \n\nI\u2019m saying it\u2019s important to have a healthy outlook on your life.\u201d For Jess, that means making twice-daily meditation and hanging out with friends as much of a priority as hitting the yoga mat or heading to the gym with a trainer. \n \nVideo  A day with Jessica Gomes \n \nAnd just like she aims to eat flexibly \u2013 based both on the seasons and whatever the hell she feels like at the time, hot chips included \u2013 she likes to mix up her exercise routine based on what city she\u2019s in, whether it\u2019s soft-sand running on Bondi Beach, a Tracy Anderson Method class in New York or a hike in the hills above LA. \n\n\u201cI always like to change it up because I do get bored. I just started doing yoga again a week ago. I haven\u2019t done it for a while; I just had the urge to do it. I definitely listen to my body in that way.\" \n\nThat attitude aids her killer confidence: when life conspires to knock it, she\u2019s ready with tricks she\u2019s tried and tested over the years she\u2019s spent in front of the camera. \n\nWATCH: How to create the perfect gym to work hair \n\n\"There are some days when I have to shoot lingerie and it's that time of the month and I'm like, \u2018Oh my God I feel awful!\u2019 I just say to myself \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got to keep moving,\u2019 and I\u2019ll do as many things as I can to make myself feel good,\u201d she says. \n\nMassage, meditation and a swim in the ocean are her go-tos. And when it\u2019s time to put on a bikini? \u201cI have a spray tan because it automatically makes me feel lighter. If you give yourself a rub with a dry brush and then go sit in the sauna, I think that really helps with water retention. \n\nRelated: Fitness looks to get excited about \n\nAnd when I\u2019m at the beach I admire people, but I think it\u2019s important not to compare. So many girls put pressure on themselves to be perfect and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good. It\u2019s all about doing things that make you feel good and just being the best version of yourself.\u201d Amen to that, Ms Gomes. \n\nGrab a copy of our October issue to learn Jess's supper-shredder workout, go-to smoothie recipe and more.", "source": "Yahoo! 7 Lifestyle"}
