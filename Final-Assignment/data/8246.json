We talk shop with\u00a0its Irish creator, New York-based Paula Flynn, and picked her brains on the world\u2019s best shops\u2026 \n \nAn appreciation of good retail has taken Dublin native Paula Flynn across continents \u2013 as a designer, a consultant and more recently in pursuit of her latest passion: her personal website, The Shopkeepers. A graduate of fashion and textiles at Dublin\u2019s NCAD, Paula is now based in a bright apartment in Midtown Manhattan, with enviable views of the East River. She\u2019s a member of New York agency Flint & Kent\u2019s design team, for whom she consults on home and lifestyle accessories, bedding, jewellery and more. \n \nAll her life, she admits, she has lived and breathed shops. \u201cAs a student, I worked weekends in local stores, and after college, I travelled Europe, Asia and the US, visiting shops and studying retail trends.\u201d Clearly, Paula is well placed to pronounce on what makes an exceptional store. \u201cPersonally, I like stores that create a captivating point of view. Design is very important: the lighting, colours, placement of product, flow of the space.\u201d It was while using this expertise to set up Orla Kiely\u2019s flagship New York showroom a few years ago that the idea for The Shopkeepers blog was born. \u201cIt is a reaction to how online shopping is changing people\u2019s shopping behaviours, affecting the traditional brick-and-mortar store,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile online shopping is all about convenience and works well for commodities, many people still want human contact \u2013 to see and touch the product, to be able to ask advice. Independent shop owners are passionate about what they do, so they are well informed. I\u2019m hopeful the \u2018buy less, buy better\u2019 ethos will continue to build.\u201d \n \nHere are Paula\u2019s top five international shops (no surprises that three of them are in merchandising mecca New York)\u2026 \n \n1. Pentreath & Hall \n 17 Rugby Street, Bloomsbury, London WC1N 3QT, UK; pentreath-hall.com \nI love the mix at Pentreath & Hall and their traditional yet fun use of colour. They bring together some of my favourite makers, including John Derian, Astier de Villatte and Peter Hone\u2019s plaster casts, which are stunning. \n \nPentreath & Hall, London \n \n2. Bellocq Tea Atelier \n 104 West Street, Brooklyn, New York 11222, USA; belocq.com \n Bellocq is one of the most inspiring spaces I\u2019ve ever been to.

Goods for the Study \n 234 Mulberry Street, Nolita, New York 10012, USA; mcnallyjacksonstore.com \n A store devoted to writing instruments and tools to support \u201cthe life of the mind\u201d, be it a room dedicated to study or a tiny work niche.
