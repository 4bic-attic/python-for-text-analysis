I am completely and utterly moved and overwhelmed at this achievement,\u201d Smith told OfficialCharts.com. \n \nHe continued: \u201cI am forever thankful to my team but most importantly to the British public for making this happen and buying my album. This moment is one to tell the grandkids and maybe their grandkids.\u201d \n  \nSo @samsmithworld has only gone and set a new Official Chart record\u2026 http://t.co/fiziIKC2Y6  pic.twitter.com/jnhgoEE5hy \n \n\u2014 Official Charts (@officialcharts) September 4, 2015 \n   Promoted stories    \nTalking to Jo Whiley recently, ahead of a performance for BBC Radio 2, he spoke about his second album. \n \nWhen asked if the album was sad or happy, he said: \u201cI\u2019m always going to be sad about something. It\u2019s not going to be about loneliness, that\u2019s all I know. I\u2019m just trying to live my life and see what happens. But I\u2019ve already managed to write some pretty sad things.\u201d \n \nFollowing his two early song successes, he went on to be nominated and subsequently won both the 2014 Brits Critics\u2019 Choice Award and the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2014. \n \nIn The Lonely Hour was named the second best selling album of 2014 in the UK, coming second only to Ed Sheeran\u2019s X. \n (Andrew Milligan/PA) \nSmith revealed in May 2014 that he was gay, and referenced his ex-boyfriend in his 2015 Grammys speech. \n \n\u201cJust a quick one \u2013 I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys!\u201d \n \nThe Stay With Me singer had to take time out and postpone a number of concerts earlier this year after doctors discovered bleeding in his throat. \n  \npic.twitter.com/XD4EP7xqhY \n \n\u2014 SAM SMITH (@samsmithworld) May 7, 2015 \n \nHe posted a message on his Instagram account, telling fans he had to have surgery. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m so gutted to be missing all of the shows and events I was meant to be playing at,\u201d he wrote. \n \n\u201cThe doctors say I will be back in 6-8 weeks and I cannot wait to sing for you all soon.\u201d \n \nTalking to Radio 2\u2032s Ken Bruce, he said the operation was a \u201cmassive blessing in disguise\u201d. \n (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \n\u201cIt was a worry just because I hate cancelling shows and disappointing people and that was horrible, but in terms of my health and my voice it was actually a massive blessing in disguise,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cI went to the throat doctor who looked after Adele and saved Julie Andrews\u2019s voice and I was in really good hands. \n \n\u201cSo I never doubted that my voice would come back, it was just the pain of having to reschedule stuff. \n \n\u201cAnd even now it\u2019s just changed the way I feel about my voice. I\u2019m a bit more scared than normal which is a good thing I guess.\u201d \n (John Shearer/AP) \nHe also commented on his slimmer frame. \n \n\u201cI lost weight, that\u2019s probably a good thing. I was really fat before. Trust me, I was fat,\u201d he said. \n \nSmith is often compared to another of his musical contemporaries \u2013 also British and the voice behind last year\u2019s Bond theme tune \u2013 Adele. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nDuring an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, he was quoted as saying: \u201cIt just annoys me that people can\u2019t digest two pop stars singing really personal songs who don\u2019t look like normal pop stars.\u201d", "source": "News Shopper"}
