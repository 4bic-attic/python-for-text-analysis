The Bible is very detailed about the evolution of sin, it begins as a thought, a temptation and we make the wrong choice, then we\u2019ve sinned. The problem is God hates sin. He\u2019ll forgive it if we ask him but he still hates it. \n \nRomans 3:23 says, \u201cFor everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God\u2019s glorious standard.\u201d Thankfully, Jesus made away for us to overcome sin. As teachers of the Bible, it\u2019s important that we teach kids how God feels about sin, how we all succumb to it and how we can overcome it. \n \nI found a fun way to illustrate how sin works\u2013with slime! I purchased \u201cslime\u201d from the toy store but you can make it too. There are plenty of slime recipes online. I begin by reading key passages about sin. Here are the ones I use but feel free to use whichever ones you choose. \n \nGalatians 5:19-21 \u00a0 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, \u00a0envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God. \n \nIsaiah 64:6 \u00a0 We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the wind. \n Then I ask a child or an adult volunteer to come forward. If the volunteer has long hair, she will need to pull it back. Give the volunteer a poncho to wear too. You don\u2019t want them to get slime on their clothes. I instruct them to hold one hand out flat with the palm up. (This should be done over a plastic tablecloth.) Before class, I write the word, \u201csin\u201d on a piece of paper and tape it to the can. I show the kids the can and say, \u201cGuess what I have today\u2013I have some sin! I am going to show you how it works, how it gets all over everything. How it creeps and creeps until it covers you. Then we\u2019re going to talk about how to get rid of it! Okay?\u201d   I pour the slime out into the hand and say, \u201cWow, that sin looks gross. Okay, now volunteer. Lift your hand up so everyone can see. That slime is getting everywhere! I need you to be really still and let that slime/sin go where it wants.\u201d Watch the slime slide down the arm.\u00a0 Say, \u201cYou know, when we first start messing with sin, we think we can control it but we can\u2019t. It\u2019s a trick. You can\u2019t control sin. It goes where it wants! The only way to be free from sin is to ask for God\u2019s help! He will forgive us and take the sin away!\u201d   Read more from Mimi by following her blog at Tools for Kids Church .
