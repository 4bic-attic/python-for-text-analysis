Duminy top-scoring with 68 off 32 balls that included six sixes and two boundaries. \n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis retired after scoring a 27-ball 42 and A.B. de Villiers made 37 off 27 balls, the pair adding 84 for the second wicket off just 50 deliveries after Quinton de Kock was run out in the first over. \n\nDuminy and Farhaan Behardien boosted the total by plundering 44 runs in the final three overs. \n\nDuminy defended his bowlers\u2019 inability to restrict the hosts, saying the tour opener was \u2018not exactly about results\u2019. \n\n\u201cI have full confidence in the ability of our bowlers and I will back them 100 per cent,\u201d the left-hander said. \u201cI believe they have what it takes to stop the Indian batting line-up. Today was a day for figuring out and assessing what will work for us in these conditions.\u201d \n\nThe tourists are due to play three Twenty20 Internationals and five one-day matches up until Oct 25, before starting a four-Test series on Nov 5. \n\nThe first Twenty20 International will be held in Dharamsala on Friday. \n\nSummarised scores:  \n\nSOUTH AFRICA 189-3 in 20 overs (J.P. Duminy 68 not out, F. du Plessis 42 retired, A.B. de Villiers 37; Kuldeep Yadav 1-26, H.H. Pandya 1-16); INDIA \u2018A\u2019 193-2 in 19.4 overs (M.A. Agarwal 87, M. Vohra 56, S.V.
