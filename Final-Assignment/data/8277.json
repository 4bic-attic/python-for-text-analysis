It\u2019s apparently called Chromecast Audio, and it\u2019ll hook up to speakers through a standard 3.5mm headphone cable. Spotify should be a streaming partner You\u2019ll apparently be able to hook up multiple Chromecast Audio units to speakers throughout a home and have them play music in sync, too. The key use of this device will certainly be playing music, which makes it a big deal that\u00a0Spotify is said to among Google\u2019s partners \u2014 a key addition to Chromecast\u2019s existing support from Google Play Music, Pandora, and Rdio. An announcement is expected\u00a0September 29th. In addition to Chromecast Audio, a\u00a0second-generation Chromecast is also supposed to be introduced with faster Wi-Fi, according to the report.
