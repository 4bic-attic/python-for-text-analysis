Its lead product is an epi-retinal implant scheduled for CE Mark application in 2015. A sub-retinal implant is being developed simultaneously.\n\nWe use a risk-adjusted NPV model with a 12.5% discount factor to achieve a value of \u20ac133.42m or \u20ac10.51/share. We assume Iris and Prima pricing is consistent with the current reimbursement of Second Sight's Argus II retinal implant. Pixium is capitalised with \u20ac31m in cash, with a burn rate of approximately \u20ac20m per year.\n\nTo download this report, please click here.\n\nAll reports published by Edison are available to download free of charge from its website http://www.edisongroup.com.\n\nAbout Edison: Edison, the investment intelligence firm, is the future of investor interaction with corporates.
