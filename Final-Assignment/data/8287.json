The industry holds strong growth opportunities in terms of production, exports and retail sales, particularly with regard to the rice, coffee, livestock and dairy sectors. Moreover, economic and financial integration in South East Asia will benefit Vietnam's exports of rice, dairy and coffee. However, Vietnam is facing growing competition in its key markets . T he fulfilment of its promising potential will only be achieved if the country steps up its competitiveness and improves both product quality and supply chain efficiency. Vietnam will have to significantly ramp up investments on crop productivity in order to not be left behind and , if it does, it will be able to produce more value-added crops and maintain its status as an export spearhead. \n\nFull Report Details at \n\n- http://www.fastmr.com/prod/1047999_vietnam_agribusiness_report.aspx?afid=302 \n\nKey Forecasts \n\nRice consumption growth to 2019: 12.0% to 24.0mn tonnes. Rice remains the major food staple in Vietnam, and we do not see this changing over our forecast period. However, rising interest in other foods such as wheat-based goods - supported by growing affluence - will restrict demand for rice, and over the forecast period we expect production growth to significantly outpace that of consumption. \n\nCorn production growth to 2018/19: 32.3% to 6.8mn tonnes. Although acreage is likely to remain stagnant or diminish; current yield immaturity means significant gains are still available via this avenue, especially as robust local corn prices provide incentives to farmers. Domestic consumption will be another important driver. \n\nThe Vietnam Agribusiness Report features BMI Research's market assessment and independent forecasts for production, consumption and trade across core agricultural commodities. \n\nBMI's Vietnam Agribusiness Report includes independent commodity price forecasting and analysis for key agricultural outputs, an overview of the agribusiness competitive landscape and a discussion of the downstream context of agricultural production in relation to country food consumption forecasts and composite food and beverage trade forecasts. \n\nKey Benefits \n\n* Use BMI's independent industry forecasts to test other views - a key input for successful planning in dynamic agribusiness markets. \n\n* Apply BMI's medium-term commodity price analysis to assist with budgetary planning and the identification of investment opportunities and potential risks. \n\n* Assess the activities and market position of your competitors, partners and clients. \n\nCoverage \n\nBMI Industry View \n\nSummary of BMI\u2019s key industry forecasts and views, highlighting recent changes and key risks to the industry outlook. \n\nIndustry SWOT Analysis \n\nAbout Fast Market Research Fast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
