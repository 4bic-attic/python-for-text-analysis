Part 1", "id": "fa128c30-94fe-43a9-a269-b646d0cbb83e", "content": "tTwo Saturdays ago I got a call from my wife\u00a0while I was teaching. She said that somebody had driven\u00a0into our fence with their car and then drove away. It was during one of hose heavy downpours of rain we had. Her mother (my mother-in-law) heard it. It was a terrible noise. She looked out the window and saw the car. It was white. But that was all she could see. My wife called the police and made a report. When I came home that night I saw that we were very lucky. Our car was parked in the driveway right next to the fence. But, only the fence was damaged. We wondered what we could do. Later, my wife told me that we had insurance. It covers natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and\u00a0floods. It also covers accidents such as this one. Lucky us! We called them and they said to send pictures and a copy of the police report and they will pay. We were very relieved. We thought we might have\u00a0to pay. And everything was fine until the culprit (the person who did the bad deed) showed up (appeared) at our\u00a0 door day three days later. To be continued.", "source": "English new and used"}
