They are still a half-game back in the wild card race, with eight games to play. \n \nThose eight games will likely be played without Street, though. \n \nStreet had to be helped off the field in the ninth inning after he came up lame when breaking off the mound, suffering a groin injury that Manager Mike Scioscia described only as \u201cnot good.\u201d \n \nThe Angels are expected to have more information on Sunday about how long Street will be out. He hurt his groin in July and missed just over a week. This time looked much more severe, though. \n \nThe Angels could withstand the loss of Street if they had Joe Smith , who has served capably as a closer before, but Smith is also out with a sprained ankle. Smith, who has been playing catch, said he\u2019s hoping to return. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to lose Joe and Huston,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it by committee and hopefully hold leads.\u201d \n \nIt leaves Trevor Gott as the Angels\u2019 most likely closer, with some combination of Fernando Salas and Mike Morin likely to fill in the seventh and eighth. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll go out with the guys, whoever we got,\u201d Chris Iannetta said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to battle and do the best with what we have. We\u2019ll never give up. It\u2019s not in our DNA.\u201d \n \nThey didn\u2019t give up on this game. Just moments after Street came off the field, Freese delivered his biggest hit as Angel, a walk-off homer to straightaway center against Danny Farquar. It\u2019s been a good week for Freese, who had a go-ahead two-run double to pull out a victory on Wednesday in Houston. \n \nThat set the Angel Stadium crowd to its feet for the second eardrum rattling cheers of the night, following Trout\u2019s spectacular game-changing catch in the fourth inning. \n \nThe Angels trailed 2-1 and Andrew Heaney was wobbling, having allowed back-to-back hits to start the inning. Jesus Montero then belted a drive to center. Trout drifted back to the fence, catapulted himself high over the fence and caught the ball above four feet over the top of the fence. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen a better one,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cThe one he made in Baltimore a couple  years ago is flat out incredible, but for him to get on that wall and hang and take a ball that\u2019s way out of the park and bring it back in, that\u2019s an incredible catch.\u201d \n \nTrout, not usually impressed by himself, clearly was this time. He flashed a big smile and did not hide the fact that he was watching the replay as he stood in the outfield. \n \n\u201cWhen he hit it, I thought it was way gone,\u201d Trout said. \u201cI just told myself, get to the wall. I climbed it. Everything else was just perfect.\u201d \n \nMontero was stunned: \u201cI forgot who was the center fielder. I thought for sure that's going to be gone. Then I saw Trout going over the wall, and I thought 'Whoa, what's going on right here?'\" \n \nWhile Trout\u2019s catch represented the biggest missed opportunity for the Mariners, the Angels had plenty of their own in the first two innings against Felix Hernandez. \n \nThe Mariners ace came up with a sore elbow during his last start, so he may not have been quite his dominating self. \n \nThe Angels had five hits, two walks and a catcher\u2019s interference in the first two innings, but they scored just one run. They left the bases loaded in both innings. \n \nErick Aybar was caught stealing, and the Angels also failed to convert on a safety squeeze. Aybar\u2019s bunt was right back to Hernandez, who flipped the ball out of his glove in time to get Johnny Giavotella at the plate. \n \nThe Angels didn\u2019t manage their second run until the sixth, when C.J. Cron \u2019s 16 th homer of the year tied the game, 2-2. According to ESPN\u2019s home run tracker, the ball traveled 436 feet, the longest homer Hernandez had allowed since 2012. \n \nThe Angels bullpen then picked up after Heaney had completed his six innings, as they will need to do over the last eight games without Street and Smith. Morin and Gott were perfect in the seventh and eighth. Jose Alvarez entered with one out in the ninth, after Street got hurt, and recorded one out. Salas got the final out, bringing the Angels back into the dugout to try to get a victory. \n \nFreese took care of the rest, not allowing for any sulking over Street\u2019s loss. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, you start thinking about Joe and Huston,\u201d Freese said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the severity of it. Late in the year you want everybody to be healthy, but we\u2019ll persevere. Hopefully it\u2019s not too serious. We\u2019ll make do.\u201d \n \nContact the writer:  jlfletcher@ocregister.com", "source": "Orange County Register"}
