'15 covered call at the $41.25 level for a net debit of about $40.15. The net debit is also the breakeven point for this trade.\n\nFor a higher return, consider buying a longer-term call option, like the Jan. '17 at the $20.00 level. By buying the call for $22.45 instead of paying about $42.45 for the stock, the assigned return rate for this alternate trade is 5.46%, but the stock has to finish above $40.15 when the sold call expires for this trade to be profitable.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s has a 5 STARS (out of 5) strong buy ranking on Reynolds American. Technical indicators for the stock have been bullish and support and resistance have been in the area of $41.61 and $42.99, respectively.", "source": "Market Intelligence Center"}
