Comparatively, for tweens, the motivation for a smartphone was communication with friends and family, games and texting. \n\nA new report from the Mobile Device UX group at Strategy Analytics (www.strategyanalytics.com) has explored the motivations and behaviors of tweens and parents with smartphones. For parents looking to give their tween a smartphone, ensuring its cost-effectiveness \u2013 both in terms of the handset itself and ongoing costs \u2013 was a main priority, being most likely to add their child to their own plan and providing hand-me-down or lower-cost devices. Parents also wanted to maintain a sense of control over their tween's smartphone; performing regular checks and withholding passwords to the app store. Monitoring a child's usage of minutes, messages and data, so as not to exceed their current allowances, was also a priority for parents. \n\nClick here for the report:\u00a0 http://bit.ly/1Nfbgms\u00a0 \n\nMonica Wong, analyst and report author commented, \"Despite parents wanting to maintain control of their child's smartphone, very few were aware of safeguard applications that are currently on the market. As such, OEMs and mobile carriers who offer these services need to do a better job at marketing them. In terms of what appeals to parents, something that allows them to mirror their child's phone, so they can see what their child is doing at any moment, and doing so remotely, is appealing.\" \n\nPaul Brown, Director, Mobile Device UX, added \"One condition many parents gave their tween to having a phone was that they could check it whenever they wanted.\u00a0 However, parents would also like the ability to see which applications their child has downloaded remotely, a dashboard that summarizes their child's smartphone activities, and a feature that allows them to locate their child at any time.\" \n\nAbout Strategy Analytics \n\nStrategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.
