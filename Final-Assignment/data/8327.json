(NHRA Photo) \n \nINDIANAPOLIS \u2013 Pro Stock driver Shane Gray is grateful for each of his four career NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series wins and has a particular place for each Wally. \n \nBut the trophy he won at last year\u2019s Chevrolet Performance U.S. Nationals, the world\u2019s most prestigious drag race, seems to get a little more of the spotlight in Gray\u2019s personal collection. \n \n\u201cThat trophy has a special place,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWe keep the trophies together in my office there at home, but this one is on a stand a little apart from the other ones.\u201d \n \nThe marquee moment in Gray\u2019s career was one of the highlights of last year\u2019s memorable event at venerable Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis. To top it, or at least match Gray\u2019s first career win at the biggest event of the year, Gray will go for a second straight win at this weekend\u2019s 61st annual Chevrolet Performance U.S. Nationals. \n \nGray will have to go to considerable lengths to top last season\u2019s performance in Indy, which included beating then teammate Dave Connolly in the final round. Connolly is now fighting for the 10th spot in his first season in Top Fuel, but Gray\u2019s victory over his friend in his Gray Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro made for a thrilling winner\u2019s circle celebration in 2014. \n \n\u201cIt meant a lot to this team to have two Gray Motorsports Chevy Camaros in the final at the Chevrolet Performance sponsored race,\u201d said Gray, who is currently seventh in points and seeking his first win in 2015. \u201cWe already felt like we had won no matter what happened, but I wanted to give Dave a decent race. You try to put it out of your mind that you\u2019re racing for a trophy at the most prestigious race on the NHRA tour and just run your race.\u201d \n \nThe prestige of the race weekend is already there for Gray, who was named the Honorary Starter for this year\u2019s event. Fellow Pro Stock driver and defending world champion Erica Enders is the Grand Marshal for the prestigious Chevrolet Performance U.S. Nationals, and Gray only hopes he will be able to share another special moment with his family and friends at the end of the weekend. \n \n\u201cThat day was really special, and my whole family was there to share it with me,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen very often anymore, and hopefully they\u2019ll all be there again. I can\u2019t tell you what it means to have been asked to be the Honorary Starter. We\u2019ll have to run really, really well \u2013 and I\u2019m going to have to drive really well, too, if we\u2019ll have a chance of repeating. But hey, we got it done once, and we know it\u2019s possible. We sure hope to make Chevrolet Performance proud.\u201d \n \nPerhaps the only thing topping a teammate in the final would be for Gray to face off with his brother, Jonathan Gray, who is currently a spot behind in the points standings in eighth, in the championship round. \n \nWith Indy counting as a point-and-a-half race, both Grays have a chance to move up heading into the Mello Yello Countdown to the Championship. Shane Gray is less than 100 points behind fifth-place Allen Johnson, but he will have to deal with a loaded Pro Stock class. Four-time world champion Greg Anderson, who has won four races in 2015, is primed for a seventh Pro Stock win at the Big Go, and others to watch include points leader Enders, who has five wins this season, Jason Line, Chris McGaha, who won back-to-back races on the Western Swing to jump firmly in to the championship picture, Vincent Nobile and two-time season winner Larry Morgan. V. Gaines is 176 points back of 10th-place rookie and local favorite Drew Skillman in the race for the final Countdown spot. \n \nBut Gray seems to be rounding into form heading into Indy and the Countdown to the Championship, advancing to the semifinals at three of the past four races. The next step is getting everything to come together perfectly at Indy for a second straight year. \n \n\u201cWinning Indy is big,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s something most guys only ever dream of. My first two years racing the U.S. Nationals I was driving a B/A Comp car, and I started racing Pro Stock there in 2010, but the first time I won a round in Indy [in Pro Stock] was in 2013. Last year was the first time I came to Indy and thought I had a chance to do something, and with all of the history there, to even have a chance is something special. When you get there, you have to try not to think about what a big deal it is. You just want to try to be the best you can be.\u201d", "source": "National Speed Sport News"}
