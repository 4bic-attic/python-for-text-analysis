It seems beyond comprehension that people could take such an electric piece of history and make something this dull, miscast, misguided, badly written, bloated, schmaltzy and shlocky out of it, but director Roland Emmerich and screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz have managed it. Almost everything about \u201cStonewall\u201d is terrible. You watch it alternately cringing and howling; the sparsely attended screening I went to was so rocked with laughter that you would have thought we were seeing the comedy of the year. \u201cStonewall\u201d caused a great deal of controversy before anyone had seen it, thanks to a trailer that pushed the real-life heroes of the riot\u2014namely, trans people, drag queens, people of color and women\u2014to the side in favor of a made-up white Midwesterner named Danny (played by Jeremy Irvine). Emmerich and Baitz defended themselves, saying that the trailer wasn\u2019t representative of the whole movie. Emmerich also said explicitly that the focus on Danny was a way to win straight people over\u2013a strange goal if ever there was one, but a goal that underscores the perverse incentives of Hollywood as well as anything could. Emmerich and Baitz clearly don\u2019t know what kind of movie they\u2019ve made. The representation issues in \u201cStonewall\u201d are very real, and very glaring\u2014yet another example of the film industry\u2019s insistence on pushing white characters to the forefront of its stories, even if they don\u2019t deserve to be there. It is Danny who throws the brick that launches the riots, Danny whose cry of \u201cgay power\u201d ignites the crowd, Danny who leads his people into battle. The filmmakers, stuck in a Hollywood bubble, seemed surprised that anyone would have a problem with this. A better rejoinder would have been to make a good movie. But almost every inch of \u201cStonewall\u201d is wrong. First, it\u2019s so, so long. You feel every one of its 129 minutes, like painful shards of boredom were breaking your mind apart. The writing is off-the-charts awful. It\u2019s as though Baitz reached into a bag marked \u201cclich\u00e9s,\u201d pulled some out at random and pasted them into the script. This is a movie where someone actually says, \u201cThose kids, they\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.\u201d Someone says, \u201cI just want to break things!\u201d about 40 minutes before he goes on to break things. Another character\u00a0actually declares, \u201cI\u2019m too mad to love anybody right now.\u201d The movie is shot through strange, grimy filters, as though Emmerich was trying to project some of the seediness of the Village through the lens. It just means that you have to squint a bit to see anything clearly. There are also anachronisms so glaring you wonder how they got through the editing process. In one sequence, Stonewall patrons dance to \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d a song that didn\u2019t come out until 1972. The biggest problem with \u201cStonewall,\u201d though, is that it\u2019s not actually about Stonewall. Any real attempt to explore the politics behind the rebellion are cast aside in favor of creaky soap opera. For some reason, \u201cStonewall\u201d thinks that what we really need is lots and lots of Danny, the sensitive Indiana boy who rolls into the Village and proceeds to learn a host of life lessons from the assorted rainbow coalition of queer ruffians whose main job in life is to worry about Danny\u2019s feelings. We spend what feels like 17 years on Danny\u2019s past in Indiana\u2013his doomed affair with another boy, his awful father\u2019s rejection, his plucky kid sister\u2019s tearful cries as he leaves the small town life behind forever. It\u2019s all so weirdly retro\u2013Emmerich and Baitz have crafted a melodrama as hoary and sudsy as anything made in 1925, let alone 2015. It would all be deliciously kitschy if you didn\u2019t sense that all involved thought they were making a profound masterpiece. This sense of antiquated staginess continues when Danny lands in New York. He immediately meets a group of Lost Boys (and, despite their gender-bending, this is decidedly a boys\u2019 movie\u2013women might\u00a0as well not exist) who, in their theatrical chatter, are more \u201cWest Side Story\u201d than anything. Their leader is Ray, a waifish Puerto Rican hustler.\u00a0It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen an actor and character so thoroughly mistreated by a movie as Ray is by \u201cStonewall.\u201d \u00a0Actor Jonny Beauchamp brings an appealingly aggressive energy to the part, but he\u2019s fighting a losing battle with the script. \u201cStonewall\u201d is more interested in whether Danny will dance with Ray than with what caused such a seismic event as the eponymous struggle\u00a0to take place. Ray\u2019s default mode is an anguished screech. He spends the whole movie wailing hysterically about why Danny won\u2019t love him, and why the world is so down on him. That the main character of color\u2019s primary function is to moon over the stupid white kid is galling enough. That the character is supposed to be based on trans pioneer Sylvia Rivera makes it all the worse. Ray\u2019s not the only whiner, though. Everybody in \u201cStonewall\u201d whines all the time. Irvine, a Brit who brings little to the central role of Danny beyond his looks, has an especially difficult time with all of the mewling, as it exposes just how shaky his American accent is. This is a big problem, because Danny has a lot to complain about. He\u2019s thrust into the sort of cautionary tale about what happens when small-town boys go astray that would not be out of place in a conservative movie from the 1950s. You can almost see the trailer: Gasp as a destitute Danny is forced to turn his first trick! (The camera closes in hilariously on his crotch as the strings of doom pierce the soundtrack.) Sympathize as he is led astray by Trevor, a liberal sleaze who just wishes those kids would stop being so angry! (Let\u2019s all light a candle for Jonathan Rhys Meyers, lampooned in a thankless role.) Feel the terror when Danny is pimped out to a sadistic, old, cross-dressing queen! (This sequence features the kind of horror-movie gay gorgons that you thought had been left behind long ago.) So much energy is expended on this bilge that, when the riot actually comes, it comes essentially out of nowhere. Emmerich and Baitz have barely bothered to lay any groundwork for the ostensible center of their film. Stonewall itself is a blip; the real story is whether or not Danny will ever reconcile with his family and make it to Columbia like he dreamed of. Obviously, there is a great movie to be made about Stonewall. Just as obviously, \u201cStonewall\u201d is not that movie. Maybe someone will be inspired by the magnitude of its failure to make the kind of film that Stonewall deserves. Oh, and if you want to see a wonderful movie about a gay boy\u2019s coming-of-age against a real-life political backdrop, watch\u00a0\u201cPride.\u201d It is as good as \u201cStonewall\u201d is bad.
