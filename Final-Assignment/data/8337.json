It was ugly \"\u201d the stat lines will speak for that \"\u201d but will Franklin\"\u2122s fix be to actually call plays? \n\n\"\u0153That\"\u2122s going to incorporate whatever I think we need at the time,\"\ufffd he said vaguely, when asked. He went on to voice his confidence in his current staff. \n\r\n\r \r\n\r \r\n\t\r \n\"\u0153I believe in these guys, I support them. But at the same time, we all got a job to do.\"\ufffd \n\nFranklin also said he had several \"\u0153internal\"\ufffd conversations with his personnel, and will be taking his cues from the success he\"\u2122s had \"\u0153stepping in\"\ufffd in the past. \n\n(Translation: He\"\u2122s presumably stepping in at a deeper level until he deems things \"\u0153fixed.\"\ufffd) \n\nOn the line \n\nFranklin confirmed that different options on the offensive line will be explored, though not in the traditional \"\u0153starter-backup\"\ufffd sense. \n\n\"\u0153I think we\"\u2122re going to have to,\"\ufffd he said. \"\u0153And I would also say it probably won\"\u2122t be one group the entire game, it\"\u2122ll probably be a little bit of a combination. \n\n\"\u0153I\"\u2122d prefer not to do that, but that\"\u2122s just kind of where we\"\u2122re at. We\"\u2122ll probably have one group to start with, and depending on how they play as the game goes on, they could stay, or we could do some sort of a rotation throughout the game. I think we\"\u2122re going to have to gain some experience and some depth, and moving some guys around is probably going to be a part of that.\"\ufffd \n\nFranklin also mentioned that a rotation in that manner was \"\u0153limited\"\ufffd on Saturday, because there were some previously unmentioned injury issues in camp that carried through, and \"\u0153some guys\"\ufffd weren\"\u2122t available. \n\nMedia sees 10 minutes of practice each Wednesday, and during that time, left tackle Paris Palmer, who started in his first game last week, saw most of his reps with the second-team offense during goal line drills \"\u201d though, based on the \"\u0153rotation\"\ufffd scenario, that doesn\"\u2122t matter much in regard to Saturday. \n\nFranklin said he thinks his line looks tentative, just days after offering that Palmer, a JuCo transfer, \"\u0153looked like he was playing in his first college football game\"\ufffd on Saturday. \n\n\"\u0153We need to be more physical,\"\ufffd he said. \"\u0153I think the first two drives of the game, we did some nice things. As the game went on, we became more tentative. We need to be more aggressive in everything we do. If we make a mistake, we make a mistake, (we) make it at full speed. Solve your problems with aggression.\"\ufffd \n\nFor a line in which all of the players have described their counterparts as \"\u0153nice guys,\"\ufffd a mean streak seems necessary. \n\n\"\u0153When you can find a nasty offensive lineman, you find something special,\"\ufffd said Franklin. \"\u0153Most of (Penn State\"\u2122s offensive linemen) have been big, nice kids their whole life. And you got to get them to figure out that when they step on the field, that they got to flip the switch.\"\ufffd \n\nThe next level \n\nTwenty-five Penn State players were on the rosters of 19 NFL teams for the league\"\u2122s opening week. \n\nThree players who left the Nittany Lions at the end of the 2014 season made teams as rookies \"\u201d safety Adrian Amos is with the Chicago Bears, tight end Jesse James is with the Pittsburgh Steelers and tackle Donovan Smith is with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Additionally, three members of the 2014 team were signed to practice squads: Deion Barnes (New York Jets), Brad Bars (New York Giants) and Mike Hull (Miami Dolphins). \n\nThe complete list of Nittany Lions on kickoff rosters is as follows: \n\nArizona Cardinals (1) \"\u201c A.Q. Shipley \n\nAtlanta Falcons (1) \"\u201c Nate Stupar \n\nBaltimore Ravens (1) \"\u201c John Urschel \n\nChicago Bears (2) \"\u201c Adrian Amos, Robbie Gould \n\nDallas Cowboys (2) \"\u201c Jack Crawford, Sean Lee \n\nDenver Broncos (1) \"\u201c Jordan Norwood \n\nGreen Bay Packers (1) \"\u201c Andrew Quarless \n\nJacksonville Jaguars (4) \"\u201c Jared Odrick, Paul Posluszny, Allen Robinson, Stefen Wisniewski \n\nKansas City Chiefs (1) \"\u201c Tamba Hali \n\nMiami Dolphins (1) \"\u201c Cameron Wake \n\nMinnesota Vikings (1) \"\u201c Gerald Hodges \n\nNew Orleans Saints (1) \"\u201c Mike Mauti \n\nOakland Raiders (1) \"\u201c Matt McGloin \n\nPittsburgh Steelers (1) \"\u201c Jesse James \n\nSan Diego Chargers (1) \"\u201c Johnnie Troutman \n\nSan Francisco 49ers (1) \"\u201c NaVorro Bowman \n\nSeattle Seahawks (2) \"\u201c Garry Gilliam, Jordan Hill \n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (1) \"\u201c Donovan Smith \n\nTennessee Titans (1) \"\u201c DaQuan Jones \n\nOff the field \n\nPenn State Athletics announced on Wednesday afternoon that the Nittany Lions\"\u2122 Oct. 3 game against Army West Point game is sold out. \n\nThe game, which marks the first time Penn State has hosted Army West Point since 1979, is a part of Military Appreciation Day and includes tickets requested through the Seats for Service Members program. \n\nMore than 6,500 Seats for Service Members have been donated by members of the Penn State community, 1,000 more than in the previous year. \n\nThe kickoff time and T.V. broadcast is to be determined. Penn State hosts Buffalo this Saturday at noon, with a broadcast on ESPN2. \n\nQuotable: \"\u0153Finish your blocks!!!\"\ufffd shrieked Hand to his line near the end of Wednesday\"\u2122s practice, during goal line drills. \n\nJourdan Rodrigue covers Penn State football for the Centre Daily Times.
