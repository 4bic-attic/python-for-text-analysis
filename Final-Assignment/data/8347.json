That can trigger warnings and illuminate the brake lights. \n \n\"As a result, the vehicle might apply the brakes until the truck is no longer perceived to be in the lane of travel,\" Ford said, an action that \"could increase the risk of a crash involving a vehicle behind the F-150.\" \n \nFord said dealers would update the cruise control software in the affected trucks at no cost to the customer.", "source": "Yahoo!
