There are more than 850,000 apps in the App Store designed specifically for iPad, and the new iPad Pro will enable a new generation of advanced apps for everything from productivity, design, illustration, engineering and medical, to education, gaming and entertainment. \n \n\n \nMeanwhile, Apple also showed off its new Apple Pencil for iPad Pro \u2013 a precision input device available for purchase separately, which makes drawing and sketching feel remarkably fluid and natural. \n \nThe touch subsystem of the Multi-Touch display in iPad Pro has been redesigned to work with Apple Pencil to dramatically reduce latency and deliver incredible accuracy for activities like fine art illustration and detailed 3D design. \n \nAdvanced sensors in Apple Pencil measure both pressure and tilt for a fast and fluid drawing experience, while a built-in Lightning connector makes for quick and easy pairing and charging. Apple Pencil also works with popular apps like Mail, Notes, Procreate and Office 365 for iPad. \n \nApple\u2019s new Smart Keyboard offers a full-sized keyboard in a thin, durable design to make it easily portable. The Smart Keyboard, available for purchase separately, attaches to iPad Pro\u2019s innovative Smart Connector port, eliminating the need for a separate battery, on/off switch or Bluetooth pairing. \n \n\n \nThe Smart Keyboard is covered in Apple\u2019s custom woven fabric and features keys that provide the accuracy, stability and satisfying key feel of standard keyboards, but is also easily foldable and can transform into a Smart Cover. \n \n\u201cThe iPad Pro is far and away the fastest iOS device we have ever made \u2014 its A9X chip beats most portable PCs in both CPU and graphics tasks, but is thin and light enough to hold all day,\u201d said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \n \nHe added: \u201cThe innovative Apple Pencil and new Smart Keyboard enable users to customise their iPad Pro experience to the particular apps they use and the work they do, making iPad Pro ideal for everything from professional productivity to advanced 3D design.\u201d \n \niPad Pro\u2019s 12.9-inch Retina display, with 5.6 million pixels and refined Multi-Touch technology, is the most advanced and highest resolution display ever in an iOS device. \n \niPad Pro comes in three metallic finishes \u2013 silver, gold and space grey and will be available starting in November. \n \n\n \nSmart Keyboard will be available in charcoal grey. New polyurethane iPad Pro Smart Covers will be available in charcoal gray and white. \n \n\n \nNew iPad Pro Silicone Cases will be available in charcoal grey and white. \n \nThe Apple Pencil is priced at $99 and the Smart Keyboard at $169. \n \nThe iPad Pro starts at $799. \n \nAvailable starting November. \n \nmegha@7days.ae \n Share this", "source": "7 Days in Dubai"}
