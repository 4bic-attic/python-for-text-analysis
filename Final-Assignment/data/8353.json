THE National Australia Bank's latest business index shows that while confidence levels pared back further in August from four points to just one point, the reading on conditions jumped five points to 11.\n\nNAB said confidence levels were at their lowest level since mid 2013, with the gains made since the May budget now having faded amid recent turmoil on financial markets.\n\nThe bank also noted that the pick up in business conditions pointed to a further improvement in the non-mining sector.", "source": "Adelaide Now"}
