It really is, I mean, who would think something like that would have happened.\u201d \n\nSlone has another reason this is all more eerie for her. \u201cI lived there for a few years when I was a teenager,\u201d she said. \n\nSlone said she lived in the home with her mother and brother about a decade ago. \n\n\u201cWhere it all happened in the basement was the workshop. My brother, all of his friends, it was a hangout spot,\u201d Slone said. \n\nThe body was discovered Saturday after detectives, working on an unrelated case, were told they should search the home at 121 6th Street. \n\nThere is still no identification on the body or even if the person was a man or a woman. \n\nDetectives are looking through missing person reports to see if there are any clues that could provide help in solving the mystery.", "source": "WLWT"}
