According to the statement, hazardous travel conditions have developed with areas of reduced visibility due to the blowing dust. \n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r \nAdditionally, critical fire weather conditions have also developed because of gusty winds and low humidity, according to the statement. An earlier fire warning said the Salt Lake Desert, Utah West Desert, Color Country West Desert and Mojave Desert were at risk for fires. \n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r \nThe National Weather Service forecasts \u00a0winds of 20-30 mph in the Cache Valley and along the northern Wasatch Front on Saturday between 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Gusts reaching 50 mph may also develop, and the windy weather may be dangerous for driving on roads and boating on lakes in the area.\u00a0 \n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r \nContact reporter Taylor Hintz at 801-625-4231 or thintz@standard.net.
