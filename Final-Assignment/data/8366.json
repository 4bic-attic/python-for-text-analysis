When a modelling agency heads to town, Landry's friend Tori and Ericka decide that the three of them should give it a go. Landry has always felt awkward as she is taller than everyone , but with her blonde hair and blue eyes and height it seems as they walk the runway at the competition - that she is what they are looking for. Landry moves to the next round and is so excited, but what happens when she discovers that her friends aren't excited for her - in fact they seem to be angry at her for going to the next round , when they should be supporting her since they were the ones who suggested she tries out. As the story goes along, we discover that Landry is also good at English and is given the chance to enter a writing competition . Landry is about to discover that sometimes the people we thought were our friends really aren't as Tori and Ericka start spreading rumours about Landry and making her life a living nightmare.\u00a0 Read on as Landry's friends True Colors are revealed during their escapade of jealousy. True Colors is aimed at female readers aged 14-16+ and almost has a christian influence and feel to the story and reminded me quite strongly of Melody Carlson's teen series. \u00a0", "source": "The Phantom Paragrapher"}
