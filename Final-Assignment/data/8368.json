They should hand over administration of the game to an eminent person. \n \n\u201cIf they love football, if they want football to have any shred of a reputation before the next major competition takes place in 2018, then they must reform from the top down and bottom-up. And they must do this through independent governance experts \u2013 not via sports administrators.\u201d \n \n#NewFIFANow has been advocating for independent reform of FIFA, led by an eminent person, since January as the only certain way of restoring trust, confidence and credibility in the world governing body of football. \n \nTo date, their call has been supported by three of FIFA\u2019s major sponsors, Coca-Cola, VISA and McDonald\u2019s; the European Parliament, Transparency International and the International Trade Union Confederation. \n \n\u201cWhat further evidence do the other sponsors need to support independent reform also and live by their values?\u201d \n \nThe other five sponsors are adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom, Hyundai and Kia. \n \nENDS \n \nFurther information:\u00a0 Damian Collins\u00a0 +44 20 7219 7072 ; Jaimie Fuller\u00a0 +41 79 481 1196 ; Bonita Mersiades\u00a0 +61 416 071 000 \u00a0(currently in European timezone). \n \nThis email was sent to\u00a0 keirradnedge@gmail.com . \nIf you are no longer interested you can unsubscribe instantly: \n http://newfifanow.cmail2.com/ t/j-u-hjiktkt-ppiyhjtu-r/", "source": "KeirRadnedge.com"}
