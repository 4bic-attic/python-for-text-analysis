Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and business executive Carly Fiorina weighed in the issue. Consistent with previous statements, candidates Bush, Fiorina, and Paul expressed support for allowing states to move forward with marijuana policies that are divergent from federal prohibition \u2014 with Sen. Paul speaking most strongly in support of states\u2019 authority to explore legalization alternatives. Senator Paul also spoke of the need for Congress to enact the\u00a0 The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States (CARERS) Act \u00a0to strengthen statewide medical marijuana protections and impose various changes to federal law. \n\nBy contrast, Gov. Christie\u00a0 reaffirmed \u00a0his desire to use the power of the federal government to override state-approved laws legalizing the retail production and sale of cannabis, which he called a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d Governor Christie implied that he would not take such action in states that have regulated the use of medicinal cannabis, such as in his home state of New Jersey. \n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, who\u00a0 shares \u00a0Gov. Christie\u2019s position, did not comment. \n\nThe fact that the majority of candidates who spoke on the issue expressed support for the sanctity of state marijuana laws is hardly surprising. According to the most recent Pew\u00a0 poll , an estimated 60 percent of Americans agree that the government \u201cshould not enforce federal marijuana laws in states that allow use.\u201d State-specific surveys from early primary states, including\u00a0 Iowa ,\u00a0 New Hampshire , and\u00a0 South Carolina , report even greater voter sentiment in favor of this position. \n\nBut while it is encouraging to see some, though not all, Republican candidates deferring to the principles of federalism in regard to the rising tide of public support in favor of marijuana law reform, far too many politicians in both parties continue to deny the reality that public and scientific opinion are in direct conflict with federal marijuana policy. In the 2016 Presidential race, it is inherent that the candidates from both political parties recognize that advocating for marijuana law reform is a political opportunity, not a political liability. \n\nNational polls \u00a0now consistently show that majorities of voters \u2014 particularly male voters, Democrat voters, and younger (Millennial) voters \u2014 embrace ending cannabis criminalization altogether, and replacing it with a system of legalization and regulation. Yet, to date, no leading candidate from either political party has embraced this broader position. That is unfortunate. In the past Presidential election, marijuana legalization ballot measures in Colorado and Washington proved to be more popular at the polls than either Presidential candidate. The 2016 Presidential hopefuls ought to be more concerned with positioning themselves to be on the right side of history than on trying to appease a vocal minority that is woefully out of touch with both changing public and scientific opinion. \n \u00a0 Related Stories Striking Breakthrough in Regulating Pot in California Bernie Sanders Vows to Strike Down Absurd Federal Marijuana Money Laws A Tale Of Two Movements: Marriage Equality And Marijuana Legalization", "source": "AlterNet.org"}
