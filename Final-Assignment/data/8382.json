But for the following tax year, economists gave lawmakers two predictions on Monday: One from the governor's office says the state will owe taxpayers nearly $117 million, while legislative economists put the figure at zero.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nTax collections currently hover at $10 billion. Refunds are required when revenue exceeds inflation and population growth.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe size of the refunds impacts whether lawmakers next year are obligated to transfer as much as $125 million to transportation or possibly nothing.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut they won't know until March when they'll be finalizing the budget.", "source": "Feed:Local Colorado Springs News"}
