We\u2019re currently undertaking a major audit of our collections in store and are looking for volunteers to help.\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity to get up close with the collections and discover more about how we care for and document objects in store.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for enthusiastic volunteers who can make a regular commitment.
