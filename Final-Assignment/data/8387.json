He was being received as Head of State. This was a diplomatic event. At diplomatic events both sides give speeches that express admiration for the other country and leader. Both leaders give speeches that build bridges and improve relationships. Both leaders find common ground and tiptoe around the tension points.\n2.\u00a0\u201cThe Pope didn\u2019t even mention the name of Jesus in the White House speech.\u00a0Harrumph.\u201d\u00a0Again. This was a diplomatic event. At this point he was not evangelizing explicitly. In this context the Pope is speaking in\u00a0a multi cultural nation to people of many denominations and religions. His role at that point is to find common ground, shared principles and values for all. So he spoke of \u201cour common home\u201d the climate change issue, human rights, religious freedom and referenced \u201cthe Creator\u201d. PS: Benedict XVI also did not mention abortion or Jesus in his visit to the White House.\n3. The Pope Fell Asleep During Mass -\u00a0So the man is 78 years old, not in the best of health, has a heavy schedule and he\u2019s also not allowed to suffer from jet lag?\n4.\u00a0The Pope Didn\u2019t Smile Enough Standing Next to the President -\u00a0Would you?\n5.\u00a0They had Protestants singing Protestant music for the Pope -\u00a0Do you know of any good Catholic choirs?\n6.\u00a0The Pope\u2019s Plane Was Too Early -\n7.\u00a0The Pope spoke about climate change to divert attention from the pedophile priest scandal.\n8.\u00a0The Pope stopped the motorcade to talk to a little girl. That was creepy\n9,\u00a0The Pope kissed an old woman. That was sexist.\n10.\u00a0The Pope\u2019s National Anthem was long and boring. I like the Star Spangled Banner Better\nOK. So I made up a few, but you get the idea.\u00a0People should relax and be happy the Pope is here.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "source": "Standing on my Head"}
