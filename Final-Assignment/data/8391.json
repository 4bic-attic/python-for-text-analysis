Giving this commitment the party must begin to build on other measures already in place such as reduction in filing fees by 50% for women which aims at promoting and supporting women\u2019s greater participation in political and public leadership.\n\nThis call is to reiterate the NDC\u2019s 2012 Better Ghana Agenda manifesto promises that \u201cIn our first term, the NDC appointed the first female speaker of parliament and the first female Commissioner of CHRAJ, among others, consistent with our commitment to advance the status of women in leadership. The next NDC government will continue to make progress on this commitment with the ultimate goal of attaining 40% women\u2019s representation in all public appointments and at the Party\u2019s Conferences and Congresses.\u201d To accelerate the process, we shall develop leadership-training programmes for women, especially young women to manage public offices and exercise responsibilities at all levels. We shall also create a special fund to support the participation of women in national and district level elections, while measures will be taken to increase the number of women Presidential appointees in the MMDAs.\n\nIt is the conviction of WiLDAF Ghana that the NDC has what it takes to make a difference if the vetting committee is directed to place women in the centre of the vetting process. It may also be complementing the NDC\u2019s effort to achieving its own target of 40% representation of women in political and public leadership as promised in the 2012 Better Ghana Agenda Manifesto whilst leveraging general efforts by the country to achieving the MDGs Goal 3 target of 30% representation of women by 2015.\n\nWe trust the NDC will be bold to take this positive initiative as a last minute stop gap to make amends to increasing the number of women in political processes in Ghana.\n\nSigned:\n\nFrank Wilson Bodza\n\nProgramme Manager in Charge of Governance\n\n0209211931\n\nMore Press Release \u00bb Comments:\n\nThis article has 0 comment, leave your comment.", "source": "Modern Ghana"}
