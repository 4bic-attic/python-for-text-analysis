And while, on paper, O2, Vodafone, Three and EE appear in arguably rude health from the perspective of their announced operating profits earlier this year, behind closed doors they are unlikely be happy to see their war chest diminished. \n   Promoted stories   \n\"That Ofcom is 'phasing in' the move to a yearly lump-sum payment for the licence fees will make it especially difficult to detect when, if and how these costs will be passed on to consumers, either directly or indirectly via the fees paid by mobile virtual network operators such as Virgin Mobile and giffgaff to piggyback their network infrastructure.\" \n \nOfcom said it did not agree that bills would have to rise as a result of the fees increase. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nA spokesman said: \"Mobile operators have a strong incentive to keep prices competitive. The operators have had five years' notice that the fees would be increased to reflect full market value and we expect them to have budgeted for this. \n \n\"The fees announced today are in line with analysts' expectations and with the amounts that operators pay for accessing spectrum in other countries.\"", "source": "Richmond and Twickenham Times"}
