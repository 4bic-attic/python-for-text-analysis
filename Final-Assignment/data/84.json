We don\u2019t even have a Cepep contract here to clean the place. We, the residents, have to chip up every month to raise money to cut the yard,\u201d Des Vignes said. The lawn outside the apartment buildings was littered with beer bottles and other debris. \n \nShe added, \u201cWe have no work here and we don\u2019t mind getting a few contracts because people here cannot even afford to buy food.\u201d \n \nAnother resident, who requested anonymity, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see the UNC here. All they doing is passing and waving. What they feel this is a beauty contest? Children hungry here and the only way we will welcome them inside here is if they treat us better.\u201d \n \nA third resident added, \u201cKamla need to come here to Embacadere and meet with us. Come and check the youths, don\u2019t send anybody else.\u201d \n \nMeanwhile, Vicky Ramlogan, who was part of Ahmed\u2019s entourage said police were called in when the residents started to get unruly. \n \n\u201cThey should not get on so because people have a right to vote for whoever they want. This is a democracy,\u201d Ramlogan said.\u00a0 \n \nHe added that the residents threw their garbage at the entourage, without any care for the environment. \n \nAhmed said yesterday that it was the first time that she received such a response during her walkabouts. \n \n\u201cPeople came out on the road and started to shout. We continued to walk. I didn\u2019t hear what they were saying,\u201d she said. \n \nAsked whether she was getting a negative response from the San Fernando West constituents, Ahmed responded, \u201cThe feeling we are getting is that some people clearly supports us and there are others who clearly do not support us. This is the first street where we got that response. We haven\u2019t had this kind of situation before where people are getting on with themselves. I don\u2019t know what their problem is but we are here to bring service to the people.\u201d Police continued patrols in the area up to press time but there were no incidents of violence.", "source": "Trinidad Guardian"}
