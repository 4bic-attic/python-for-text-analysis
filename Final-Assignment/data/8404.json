Life\u2019s a Blog has reviewed the trailers of the many movies coming to TIFF 15 and we have selected our top five \u201cmust see\u201d movies. \u00a0Myself, I\u2019m much more of a comedic story kind of person, but with the recent focus that the transgender community has received due to Caitlin Jenner, it has inspired\u00a0me to learn more about this complicated, yet very real issue that transgenders and their family face.\u00a0The movie Ray includes Naomi Watts, Susan Sarandon and Elle Fanning in this funny and touching story about a NYC teenager struggling with gender identity. 2. \u00a0I\u2019ve watched the trailer \u2018Remember\u2019 several times and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that I\u2019m a Christopher Plummer fan or if it\u2019s the very vague reference to history that intrigues me. \u00a0For me though, it\u2019s a must see. A nursing-home resident (Academy Award winner Christopher Plummer) sets out to exact vengeance on the man who murdered his family seven decades earlier, in this compelling thriller from master director Atom Egoyan. \u00a0 3. \u00a0Number 3 is hopeful because I\u2019m expecting a little comedy\u00a0within a whole lot of drama. \u00a0Toni Collette and Drew Barrymore star in this touching comedy-drama about two childhood friends whose relationship is put to the test when one becomes pregnant while the other receives some tragic news. \u00a0\u2018Miss You Already\u2018 has no trailer, but the description and the actors intrigues me. 4. \u2018The Dressmaker\u2019 looks like a balanced mix\u00a0of a great storyline and my favourite actors. \u00a0 Academy Award winner Kate Winslet, Liam Hemsworth, and Judy Davis star in this adaptation of the best-selling novel by Rosalie Ham, about a dressmaker who returns to her tiny Australian hometown from the chic fashion houses of Paris to put her past to rest \u2014 and revolutionize the local women\u2019s couture while she\u2019s at it. 5. \u2018Freeheld\u2019 starring Julianne Moore, Ellen Page, Steve Carell and Michael Shannon is a true story about terminally ill New Jersey police officer Laurel Hester, whose 2005 legal battle to pass on her pension benefits to her domestic partner became a flashpoint for LGBT activism. What movies do you want to see at TIFF15? \u00a0Like every year, the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival will not disappoint movie lovers. \u00a0 Check out all of their trailers on YouTube\u00a0or on their TIFF.net website.
