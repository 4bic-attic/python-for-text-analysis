There is a lot more to do here, in other words, than yell at the TV or political opponents on social media.\r \n \n\r\n                            So many of the issues or turning points so far in this election campaign have asked nothing of citizens, beyond casting a ballot on Oct. 19. The average Canadian, when all is said and done, can\u2019t do much about recession figures , oil prices or the Mike Duffy trial .\r \n \n\r\n                            The refugee crisis is something totally different \u2014 there are substantial ways in which Canadians, not just politicians, can be part of a solution.\r \n \n\r\n                            It was former prime minister Joe Clark, appearing on CBC\u2019s Power and Politics broadcast this week, who put his finger on this dimension of the refugee issue. Yes, he said, the death of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi certainly would summon up some heat on the election trail.\r \n \n\r\n                            But the \u201ccitizen-driven\u201d response, Clark predicted, would be equally crucial \u2014 just as it was when he was prime minister in 1979 and Canada welcomed thousands of Vietnamese refugees.\r \n \n\r\n                            \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about the tragic death of this very young person is that it could well be a major turning point in the reaction of Canadians \u2014 the willingness to support a much more aggressive acceptance of refugees,\u201d Clark said.\r \n \n\r\n                            There\u2019s an irony here, obviously. While a lot of the domestic issues in the election turn on choices that only the political leaders need to make, this international issue is one in which citizens\u2019 actions could make a material difference. The \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something?\u201d question to politicians also can be turned back to \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do something?\u201d\r \n \n\r\n                            I spent some time in the last few years writing a book on how the marketing world had influenced politics \u2014 and how citizens had become mere \u201cconsumers\u201d of our civic culture.\r \n \n\r\n                            One of the accidental consequences in this equation was the idea that government is something that is done to people, rather than \u201cof the people.\u201d It\u2019s been a while since any politician dared voters not to ask what their country could do for them, but rather what they could do for the country, in the famous words of president John F. Kennedy.\r \n \n\r\n                            Think about the simple word \u201cservice.\u201d In the 20th century, service was more often something that citizens did for their country \u2014 service in the military or in the community. \u201cService clubs,\u201d the kind recently offered tax breaks by the Conservatives on the election trail, are a heartening vestige of that idea.\r \n \n\r\n                            But when we talk about service in the 21st century, it\u2019s more often about something that has to be done for us \u2014 \u201cthat restaurant has bad service\u201d or \u201cI want better service from my MP.\u201d\r \n \n\r\n                            That\u2019s also the thinking behind the unfortunate labelling of citizens as \u201ctaxpayers\u201d \u2014 government as a series of transactions in exchange for services or discounts on your annual tax bill.\r \n \n\r\n                            There\u2019s been a temptation to see the refugee crisis abroad through this lens: suffering people having a bad consumer experience with service at the Canadian shop window. While this may be true to an extent, citizens can also be checking whether they\u2019re keeping their own doors and windows open.\r \n \n\r\n                            So what can citizens do? Jennifer Bond, a professor at the University of Ottawa who has done a lot of work on refugee issues, put a helpful post on Facebook on Thursday evening, in direct response to friends asking how they could help. Among Bond\u2019s suggestions:\r \n \n\r\n                            \u2022 Donate to one of the beleaguered international aid groups or to charities at home in Canada trying to help refugees.\r \n \n\r\n                            \u2022 Give time or household goods to groups supporting refugee claimants in Canada.\r \n \n\r\n                            \u2022\u00a0Consider becoming a private sponsor to a refugee family (as Toronto Mayor John Tory has done ). \u201cYou (and your friends or organization) could actually bring a person to Canada. You could directly save lives,\u201d Bond writes.\r \n \n\r\n                            Accidentally, and also tragically, this refugee crisis is showing Canadians a possible remedy for political apathy: present the citizens with something they can do; talk about issues in which voters are more than powerless spectators or target constituencies of \u201ctaxpayers.\u201d\r \n \n\r\n                            If this idea catches on \u2014 citizens and politicians as co-participants in government \u2014 then a tragedy on a foreign shore could change politics here in a way that no other issue in this campaign has to date.", "source": "Inside Halton"}
