He helped the team reach it 14 times \u00a0during his 18 seasons in the Bronx, playing in more\u00a0 Fall Classic games than any other major leaguer; and was a three-time American League Most Valuable Player . But, his name appears almost as often in Bartlett\u2019s Famous Quotations as it does in baseball\u2019s record book. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1943, his first professional season with the Yankees\u2019 farm team in Norfolk, Va., was interrupted by World War II. He joined the Navy, and later served on a gunboat supporting the D-Day invasion. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Berra played for the Yankees from 1949-65. His teammates included fellow Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, and Whitey Ford. In 1956, he caught the only perfect game in World Series history and after the last out, he\u00a0leaped into pitcher Don Larsen\u2019s arms. The moment was captured in photographs, published in newspapers around the world. Berra, who played in 15 straight All-Star Games , never earned more than $65,000 a season. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 After he retired,\u00a0Berra coached or managed the Yankees, New York Mets , and Houston Astros . He led both the Yankees and the Mets to pennants. In 1985, his firing as manager by the Yankees 16 games into the season sparked a feud with George Steinbrenner. Berra vowed never to return to Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owned the team. He finally relented, throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of the Yankees\u2019 season-opening game in 1999. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 Berra published three books: his autobiography in 1961, It Ain\u2019t Over\u2026 in 1989, and The Yogi Book: I Really Didn\u2019t Say Everything I Said  in 1998. The last made the New York Times\u2019  Best Seller list. In 1996, Berra was awarded an honorary doctorate from the state university in Montclair, N.J., where he and his family lived. The university also named its baseball stadium for Berra. The adjoining Yogi Berra Museum opened two years later. The museum houses Berra memorabilia, including what he said was his most prized possession, the mitt he used to catch Larsen\u2019s perfect game. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was a fan favorite, especially with kids, and the cartoon character Yogi Bear was named after him. He\u00a0recently delighted television viewers by bringing his malapropisms to a commercial with the AFLAC duck. \n \nYogi Berra was an American original. He was 90. \n \nUntil next time>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cnever forget\u201d", "source": "Forgotten Hollywood"}
