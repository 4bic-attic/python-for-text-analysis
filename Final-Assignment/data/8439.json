She also previously served as digital editor for the Washington Post\u2019s foreign desk. \n\nHeron addressed her job change in a note published, naturally, on Facebook. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled at the opportunity to help take HuffPost to the next level both as a media innovator and supporter of high-impact journalism \u2014 in the U.S. and increasingly around the world. More on this soon once I get started!\u201d she wrote. \n\nHer jump to HuffPost is the reverse of another notable move seen earlier this month, when Anne Kornblut stepped down as associate editor at the Washington Post to become director of strategic communications at Facebook. \n\nHeron joins HuffPost \u2014 which celebrated its 10 year anniversary in the spring \u2014 at a time when the site is in the midst of transition. \n\nHuffPost was included in Verizon\u2019s acquisition of AOL earlier this year, which caused some to question the future of both the news site and its founder. \n\nBut Huffington eventually renewed her contract after the Verizon deal and, in a memo circulated to staff in June, she asserted that HuffPost is \u201cpositioned to grow and dominate the industry in the coming years.\u201d", "source": "NASH FM 102.5"}
