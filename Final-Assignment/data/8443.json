(Photo: Charlie Nye / The Star) \n\nFollowing an FBI raid at the home of American Senior Communities' CEO James G. Burkhart earlier this week, the senior health-care facility corporation terminated\u00a0Burkhart's employment, effective immediately, according to a news release on Friday. \n\nWhile the government has yet to comment on why FBI agents searched Burkhart's home, an internal ASC review concluded that the federal investigation \"does not touch upon the operation of any nursing home serviced by ASC,\" the ASC release said. \n\nOn Tuesday morning, a\u00a0cadre of federal agents raided Burkhart's home in\u00a0Carmel.\u00a0FBI investigators also were at the Southside headquarters of American Senior Communities, at 6900 Gray Road, according to reports. \n\n\u201cThe FBI is conducting an investigation into criminal activity in the Carmel area,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Wendy Osborne told The Indianapolis Star. But that\u2019s all she would say. \n\nWhen asked if ASC would consider reinstating Burkhart if the government's investigation proves fruitless, a spokeswoman said she hadn't heard any discussion about that. \n\n\"American Senior Communities is launching an immediate search for an interim and permanent CEO who will embrace ASC\u2019s core values,\" a company statement\u00a0said.\u00a0\"Meanwhile, the chief executive functions have been assumed by the American Senior Communities\u2019 board of managers, each of whom has long-term experience in the health-care business, and senior care in particular.\" \n\nAmerican Senior Communities manages nearly 100 senior care facilities and is one of the largest nursing home management companies in Indiana. Among those are 60 sites, including skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities throughout the state, that the company manages under a contract with Marion County\u2019s public health agency. \n\nThe organization also serves more than 6,600 seniors and employs more than 8,200 people, according to ASC\u2019s website. The company's frequent television ads salute the accomplishments of elderly nursing home residents. \n\nA certified public accountant, Burkhart worked for the accounting firm Ernst & Young before entering the health-care field. \n\nBurkhart is a member of the Eskenazi Health Foundation Board and a trustee at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, from which his two children graduated. \n\nBurkhart is also chairman of the board of directors of the Indiana Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes in Indiana. \n\nThe association released a statement Tuesday: \n\n\u201cThe Indiana Health Care Association just learned of the investigation this morning. We will continue to gather information as it becomes available. Right now, our most important priority is the care of the Hoosiers in our 330 member centers across the state.\u201d \n\nIn 2010, American Senior Communities agreed to pay $376,432 in penalties to settle a complaint that it employed seven workers who were ineligible under federal rules for reasons including the loss of licenses and a criminal conviction. At the time, it was the largest such settlement to date. \n\nBut whether that had\u00a0anything at all to do with Tuesday\u2019s raid is unclear. \n\nStar reporters Shari Rudavsky and Maureen Groppe contributed to this story. \n\nCall Star reporter Michael Anthony Adams at (317) 444-6123.
