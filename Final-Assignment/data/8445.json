He (Lord Ashcroft) has set out his reasons for writing it. The Prime Minister is focused on getting on with the job of running the country.\"\n\nFormer deputy prime minister Nick Clegg denied blocking Lord Ashcroft's appointment, but said he had become used to Conservatives \"using me as an alibi for awkward decisions that they have to face within their own party\".\n\n\"I have no doubt that this just fell into that same category,\" the former Lib Dem leader told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.\n\nMs Oakeshott denied the book was a \"revenge job\" by Lord Ashcroft, saying he could have chosen to release it in the run-up to the general election.\n\n\"That would have caused far more damage, he could easily have done that. Or indeed we could have published the book over party conference,\" she told The World At One.\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "Halifax Evening Courier"}
