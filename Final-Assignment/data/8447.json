Ballots need to be returned to the Fillmore County Courthouse by 5 p.m. Oct. 13. \n\nThe proposed aquatic center would replace and occupy the same site as the current pool, which is deteriorating and beyond repair. The water park\u2019s plans include shaded areas, zero-depth entry pool, a flume slide, a family slide, a splash pad, diving board, climbing wall, bathhouse and concessions. \n \nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Christin Lovegrove, a member of the pool committee, recapped the process and explained the cost of the project, the proposed funding mechanism and the ballot language. \n\n\u201cThis number is based on past projects and the current bidding rate,\u201d Lovegrove said. \u201cThat cost also includes demolition of the current pool. There\u2019s a very high likelihood that we will use some local contractors and local people who would probably cut that cost down somewhat.\u201d \n\nThe city of Geneva entered into an interlocal agreement with Fillmore Central Public Schools to get the issue on a ballot, but the school district won\u2019t be responsible for any payments and the project will have no impact on the school\u2019s tax levy, Lovegrove said. \n\nThe ballots will include two propositions, and both will ask voters for a \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d decision. \n\nProposition One asks voters if they want the city to issue bonds for the construction and equipping of a swimming pool and related improvements. \n \nProposition Two asks voters if they would like to add a half-cent tax to the city\u2019s current 1.5 percent city sales tax. The addition of the local sales tax would put the total sales tax rate at 7.5 percent in Geneva. \n\nLovegrove said the Geneva City Council has indicated that collections from the proposed additional half-percent cent sales tax would go toward making yearly payments on the 25-year bond to pay for construction of the proposed aquatic center. \n\n\u201cIf the sales tax doesn\u2019t pass the vote but the want to build a pool does, the bonds will be paid for using property taxes,\u201d Lovegrove said. \u201cIf the want of a pool fails and the want of a sales tax increase passes, nothing will be done.\u201d", "source": "Hastings Tribune"}
