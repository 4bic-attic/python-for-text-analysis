That trial will proceed. \n\nThe settlement also does not include any admission of guilt by the city. Gray's death sparked days of peaceful protests and a night of riots in April . \n\nRawlings-Blake expressed her condolences to the Gray family. \n\nShe said she understood that no amount of money could bring back their loved one, but, she added, she hoped that this settlement gives them a \"measure of closure.\"", "source": "krwg.org"}
