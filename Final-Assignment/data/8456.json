Employees perform a wide range of activities for an ever-changing roster of clients, and PCL works to continually improve its workforce utilization in order to maximize revenues while delivering on client demands. It recognized an opportunity to centralize hours and activity data for enterprise reporting, and went to market looking for a capable time and attendance system. \n \nTop of mind was the ability to track and approve staff timecards for all projects across the United States and Canada. The primary goal was to streamline a dated and inefficient process. The convenience and simplicity of an application was also front of mind, because staff were often at remote construction sites and could not be pulled away at any length to learn or use a new software system. PCL selected WorkForce Software's EmpCenter based on superior scores in these and other selection criteria. \n \n\"We needed a solution that was intuitive and easy for employees to use from anywhere, to record time and properly allocate it to the correct project cost accounts, and EmpCenter topped our list,\" said Kevin Sundquist, relationship manager, at PCL Construction. \"Its simple design, clear prompts and ability to integrate with other systems will minimize the effort for time entry.\" \n \nEmpCenter will also streamline overtime pay calculations and other labor compliance requirements across numerous states and provinces. These efficiency gains will help PCL dedicate even more resources towards client projects, and bolster the company's growth. \n \n\"Like many other progressive large-scale companies, PCL recognizes the value in automating time and attendance to improve workforce planning, optimize costs and better serve its clients,\" said Kevin Choksi, co-founder and CEO of WorkForce Software. \"We are excited to partner with PCL to help them further improve labor efficiency and benefit from the visibility that EmpCenter delivers.\" \n \nAbout PCL Construction \nPCL is a group of independent construction companies that carries out work across Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, and in Australia.
