Two Embryos in One Anolis sagrei egg", "id": "25e80e3b-7967-4b7c-8fbd-7893c1598938", "content": "(Before It's News)  \n\nFor the last several months, I\u2019ve been collecting eggs from 36 female\u00a0 Anolis sagrei\u00a0 from Gainesville, FL. This is for a project on linking the movement patterns and mating patterns of brown anoles. To be able to assess which males have mated with each of these females, I\u2019ll be sequencing the DNA from the mothers, their offspring, and potential fathers, and then trying to figure out which males have fathered each female\u2019s offspring. All this is to say that what I want from the eggs I\u2019ve been collecting is the offspring\u2019s DNA. To this end, I\u2019ve been dissecting out embryos from eggs about ten days after laying, and storing the tissue for future genetic work. \n \nSo far, the females have laid over 300 eggs, and dissecting embryos out of them has gotten a little monotonous. So I didn\u2019t pay any special attention to an egg that looked perhaps a bit bigger than normal. I was shocked, though, when two seemingly healthy embryos popped out of it! \n  \nTwo embryos from a single brown anole egg \n  \nMy initial excitement waned when I realised that twins are not that rare in humans, but returned when two anole breeding experts ( AA correspondents Thom Sanger and Anthony Geneva) said that they haven\u2019t seen anything quite like this before. In Thom\u2019s words, \u201cI\u2019ve only found two [twins] in over a decade of dissecting eggs, both were conjoined and inviable. I think you have something special.\u201d \n \nHave any of you seen anything like this before?", "source": "Before It's News"}
