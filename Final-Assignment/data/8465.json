The dancing couple joked afterwards of making a television show in Australia together called Derek and Bindi's Wild Adventures.\n\nIrwin's competitors include Backstreet Boys member, Nick Carter, and singer Chaka Khan.\n\n\ufeff The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "source": "The North West Star"}
