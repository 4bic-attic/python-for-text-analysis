Jim McGreevey\u2019s four-month stint as a Hudson County attorney has brought him health benefits for life. \n\nCounty spokesman James Kennelly tells The Jersey Journal ( http://bit.ly/1YcKRtn ) that the county doesn\u2019t have a cap on service time in exchange for benefits. \n\nMcGreevey spearheaded the creation of a prisoner re-entry center for the county. Kennelly says the center\u2019s benefit outweighed the cost of ending up as his final government employer. \n\nOfficials didn\u2019t say how much money the benefits could cost. \n\nThe 58-year-old former governor runs Jersey City\u2019s prisoner re-entry program. He will receive a $66,837 state pension. \n\nMcGreevey declined to answer most questions from the newspaper but said he received a $75,000 salary from the county. \n\nHe resigned as governor amid a sex scandal in 2004 and announced that he was a \u201cgay American.\u201d \n\n___ \n\nInformation from: The Jersey Journal , http://www.nj.com/jjournal", "source": "LocalNews7.com"}
