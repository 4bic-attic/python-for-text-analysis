It is humbling to lose, but that does not compare to the honour of being asked to lead,\" he said. \n\n\"Leadership changes are never easy for our country. I pledge to make this change as easy as I can. There will be no wrecking, undermining or sniping,\" said Abbot. \n\nIANS", "source": "Oneindia"}
