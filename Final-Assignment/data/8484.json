Fortunately, many of Portland's best lunch spots, from the old-school Higgins Restaurant to Peter Bro's\u00a0All-Way burger, are centrally located. \n\nFeasters, hit these restaurants up before embarking on another night of the food sweats. For natives, we offer a challenge: get restless. Even though your neighborhood spot is the best\u2014and definitely no one is arguing\u2014there's always more to explore.\n\nWe've no doubt left someone's favorite lunch spot off this list, so tell us in the comments: Where would you send visitors?*\n\n*And don't say back to where they came from because it's really just not that funny, right?\n\nAll photos courtesy of Dina Avila unless noted.", "source": "Eater Portland -  All"}
