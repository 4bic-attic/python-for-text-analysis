South Temecula has many things, but corner hangouts for after a sports game, a beer softball league, or a place for teams to host their latest fundraiser are in short supply. \n \nEnter Suzette Swanger, mother and Temecula resident, who saw a restaurant in crisis and stepped in to take it to the next level. \n \n\u201cWe purchased Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs over five months ago,\u201d Swanger said, \u201cand it\u2019s been a heck of a ride since.\u201d \n \n Lagunitas IPA on tap at Temecula\u2019s Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs \u2013 the hot dog joint around the corner. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nThis hot dog shop has changed hands a few times, but Swanger has that special something to make sure that all who enter to try Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs will return again, with friends and family in tow. \n \nInside, it\u2019s like being invited to a family barbecue \u2013 complete with checked table cloths, mountains of napkins for the juicy dogs and sandwiches and ample supplies of squeezable mustard and ketchup. A jukebox on the wall plays fun, classic or recent hip tunes, depending on the crowd. Regulars hang out at the bar. Families at the tables, ordering hand dipped sweet corn dogs or baskets of homemade potato chips. \n \nRemember, when you come in to Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs, bring the family and prepare to mind your manners during the big game. \n \n\u201cWe initiated a \u2018Bad Word Box\u2019 for anyone caught swearing at the bar when kids are present,\u201d Swanger said, thumbing through the stack of bills. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new idea and fun for those in the know. At the end of the month we plan on donating the funds raised to a local charity.\u201d \n \nBehind the bar, tap handles range from backyard barbecue cheap beer \u2013 Pabst Blue Ribbon \u2013 that will more than likely always remain on tap, according to Swanger, to featured craft brew, such as the Petaluma based brewer Lagunitas IPA. Regionally famous for their India Pale Ale, this well balanced beer is now featured at Devil Dogs. With caramel malt barley to mellow the hop flavors, Lagunitas is one for beer lovers to try. \n \n\u201cI love having friends over, cooking and entertaining. Devil Dogs has become a natural extension of that,\u201d she said. \n \n Suzette Swanger, right, and staff mug for the camera while the games play on one of many TVs in this local sports bar and restaurant. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nLunch time at this hot dog shop finds locals at the many tables or hanging out at the comfortable bar seating. TVs have multiple games on, showcasing college football on a September morning. The menu is chock full of gourmet hot dogs, such as the bacon wrapped Sonoran Dog, or the Portuguese Hawaiian Sausage, with spicy Mad Mike\u2019s sausage combined with sweet pineapple flavors. Of course, fans can build their own hot dog or sausage creations with the ever growing list of toppings. \n \n\u201cLast week, we added mushrooms to our list,\u201d Swanger said. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to see just how high people can top their hot dogs or sausages.\u201d \n \nAlong with the multiple specialty dogs and sandwiches, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs also makes their own hand-cut French fries, onion rings, and homemade potato chips. \n \n\u201cWe consider ourselves farm to table here, even though our farm is in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is homemade here in the shop.\u201d \n \n Hand Dipped Corn Dogs are sweet and crunchy, \u201clike we get at the fair!\u201d as one child described the tasty offering. Shown over a bed of hand cut fries and homemade potato chips, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs can turn anything on their gourmet menu into a corn dog. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nSide dishes for the gourmet offerings are just as one would expect from a corner hot dog shop, with the added benefit of Swanger\u2019s special touch. \n \nThe coleslaw is her family recipe, not creamy but sliced thin, crisp cabbage and poppy seeds made in small batches and tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette. This slaw complements the perfectly prepared hotdogs and sausages. Her potato salad, in a nod to deviled eggs, has a kick and just the right balance of sweet, salt, and heat with the addition of paprika and pimento. \n \nBringing Mad Mike\u2019s Sausages into the mix was a natural choice for Swanger, making gourmet hot dogs the order of the day. From mild to wild, the big name in local sausage can be fully tasted here. \n \n\u201cMad Mike\u2019s adds that amazing flavor for every dog and sausage, except those listed as Vienna Beef hot dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cHis chicken sausage is simply the best I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d \n \nThe gourmet Sonoran Dog, a bacon wrapped 8-inch hot dog, topped with refried beans, flavorful homemade guacamole, pico de gallo and drizzled with sour cream all on a sweet hot dog bun will satisfy lovers of the traditional Mexican hot dog. Swanger\u2019s guacamole will have you begging for the recipe though it\u2019s a trade secret. The hand-cut chips are an ideal side for this dish, salted, light and crisp, not greasy in any way. \n \n A whimsical example of \u201cfarm to table,\u201d Suzette Swanger shows how the potatoes from their grower transform into the thinly sliced potato chips they make and serve daily at Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \n\u201cWe\u2019re becoming famous for our chips,\u201d she said. \n \nFans and friends of Devil Dogs can come for any game, any time, and the television will never be turned off before the game is done. \n \n\u201cWe won\u2019t throw people out just because it\u2019s after our closing time, if the game goes long,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cThe name, \u2018Devil Dogs\u2019 is a United States Marine Corps reference, though our family isn\u2019t in the military,\u201d she said. \u201cWe kept that name because we are proud to be Americans, and of our soldiers in this military town. That\u2019s why we decided to focus on Patriot Day for a raffle and fundraiser.\u201d \n \nThe donations for this fundraiser, to raise funds toward the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command Foundation are growing daily. \n \n\u201cWe are big fans of this local charitable foundation that raises funds for local Marine families,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, and with Patriot Day coming, we knew we needed to do something to help.\u201d \n \n A United States Marine Corps commemorative poker chip was a gift to Suzette Swanger, from one of her many military guests. Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs is a friend to the military and those who have served. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nThe Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs fundraiser will run from Friday, Sept. 11 through Tuesday, Sept. 15 with all proceeds benefitting the MARSOC Foundation. Raffle items will include Mad Mike\u2019s American Gourmet Products, a golf package, and a guitar donated by Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n\u201cWhen we learned about the MARSOC Foundation, we knew we needed to do something to draw attention to this organization,\u201d she said. \n \nFind Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs in Temecula at 43810 Butterfield Stage Rd #102.
