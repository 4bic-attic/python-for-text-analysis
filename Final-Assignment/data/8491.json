We are neighbors and can't change the geography,\" Attiyah said. \"We have to discuss all issues and leave nothing behind and only then we can have a normal relation between neighbors.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, the Qatari emir also said Iran and Persian Gulf states should enter negotiations in order to settle their political differences, Tasnim News Agency reported.\n\n\"The disputes (between Iran and some certain Persian Gulf Arab states), in my opinion, are political, regional, Arab-Iranian differences rather than being a Sunni-Shia dispute,\u201d Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said during his address at the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly on Monday.", "source": "Iran Daily"}
