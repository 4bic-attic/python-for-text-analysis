It happened over the road basically on my doorstep, which is alarming. \n \n\u201cBut we are lucky it is not like the US where nearly everyone is running around with a gun and the police have been very reassuring and super responsive.\u201d \n \nA convenience shop owner who refused to be named said police came in on Monday to collect CCTV footage of the incident. \n   Promoted stories   \nShe said: \u201cWe are very worried. My staff are all frightened because it is normally very quiet around here. \n \n\u201cThere used to be lots of stabbings and robberies but it has slowed down recently. \n \n\u201cI am frightened because some nights we only have one person working here at a time.\u201d \n \nTim Reedy a cartoonist said the incident came as a shock to the neighbourhood. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything but saw about ten officers around a tree the next day examining it for bullet holes\u201d, he said. \n \n\u201cIt is a really quiet neighbourhood, we had anti-social neighbours once but they left about a year ago. \n \n\u201cThis is the kind of road where you can ask your neighbours to look after your cat or water your plants if you go away. So it is unnerving for something like this to happen.\u201d \n \nA London Ambulance spokeswoman said: \"We were called at 12.13am to Brettenham Road to reports of an assault. \n \n\"We sent an ambulance crew and duty station manager to the scene. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"We treated a man reported to be in his 20s for back injuries. \n \n\"He was taken as a priority to hospital.\"", "source": "St Albans and Harpenden Review"}
