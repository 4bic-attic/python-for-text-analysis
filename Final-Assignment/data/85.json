Vongerichten is also creating a casual restaurant on Pier 17, which will open sometime in 2017. \n\nRELATED: What's new at the reopened Queens Night Market, now in Jamaica \n\nThe market will be more like Le District than Gansevoort Market , with a Vongerichten wonderland of chowder, sushi and raw bars driven by nostalgia for Fulton Street Fish Market, which moved uptown to the Bronx. The seafront restaurant will also be low-key instead of fine dining, with a quarter of its square footage devoted to a patio. \n\nOther upcoming food hall projects in the works include Danny Meyer\u2019s Hudson Yards behemoth , while Anthony Bourdain is looking to colonize the \u201cSuperPier\u201d on the west side with a 100,000-square-foot dystopian Asian-style market . A new branch of Eataly is also set to open downtown this winter.", "source": "Metro.us"}
