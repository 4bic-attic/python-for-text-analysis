What\u2019s up with that? \n \nYou don\u2019t have a good way of tracking those bills that happen a few times a year. \n \nYou run out of money and don\u2019t have enough to pay the bills, even though you know you make enough\u00a0money. \n \nWhat do financial gurus know that you don\u2019t? It\u2019s simple, track your bills in one place. \n \nWhether you do this on Excel, a sheet of paper, or using my Bill Pay Checklist \u00a0(pictured below) from my new book, Budgeting Made Easy . \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter what you use, as long as you do it. \n \n\n \n1. List all of your bills. \n \n2. Organize them by due date. \n \n3. Create columns for each month to\u00a0check off when you\u2019ve paid that bill. \n \n4. Create a separate sheet or section for bills that are due a few times a year , like car insurance. \n \n5. Place this bill tracker where you can see it every day and near your checkbook. \n \n6. Mark which bills are on autopay. Even with autopay, you still have to track and make sure the payment was completed. \n \n7. When payday arrives, refer to the bill tracker to see which bills will come before the next pay period. Allot enough money to pay those bills. Put this money into a separate bill paying account, if you want to make it even easier. \n \n8. Put these bills into your monthly calendar. \n \n9. Communicate with your significant other (or anyone you\u2019re splitting the bills with) about the upcoming bills. \n \nWant a step-by-step guide on creating a budget that you\u2019ll stick with?
