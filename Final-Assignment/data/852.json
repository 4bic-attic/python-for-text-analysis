Without surgery and treatment, restrictive cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure.\n\nGrace Cantrell was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy at three years old and promptly began receiving treatment at Children's healthcare of Atlanta. Though doctors warned the Cantrells that they would likely outlive their daughter, Grace was saved by a donor heart that she received in a transplant on her fourth birthday. While the good news is that Grace is healthy and healing, her family is still struggling to manage the significant medical costs associated with her life-saving treatment.\n\n\u201cWe are all extremely thankful that Grace is alive and well,\u201d says Mack McClung, owner and manager of Georgia Insurance Advisors. \u201cWith the money they spent on Grace\u2019s treatment, the Cantrell family needs everyone in our community to pitch in and help make sure Grace is well cared for in the years to come.\u201d\n\nMobilizing a network of professional and personal contacts, the Georgia Insurance team is making inroads with friends, neighbors, and business associates alike as they raise awareness about Grace\u2019s condition and seek donations that will be used to assist her family in paying off her med\n\n'/\"/", "source": "Bio-Medicine"}
