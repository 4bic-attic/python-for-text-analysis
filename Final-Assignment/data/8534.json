Even the ANC acknowledges in its NGC discussion document that the SABC is in a crisis due to poor management and a lack of accountability.\n\nIt is significant that in 2014 the Public Protector found Motsoeneng guilty of unlawfully increasing his own salary three times in the space of one year. It appears that he is at it again.\n\nThe Public Protector also found that Motsoeneng lied about having a matric when he applied for a job at the SABC.\n\nThe fact is that Motsoeneng should have been suspended and disciplined by the SABC Board as directed by the Public Protector. Instead, Motsoeneng continues to rake in millions of rands at the expense of the TV licence paying public.\n\nThere can be no justification for Motsoeneng\u2019s salary to increase by 31% in one year. In comparison, other workers in the public sector such as nurses, teachers and police officers received a 7% increase over the same period.\n\nIt should be remembered that Motsoeneng was earning just R 334 000 as an SABC radio producer in 2010. Five years later and his salary has increased more than ten-fold. Must be nice to have friends in high places.\n\nThe DA will be requesting the Public Protector to investigate the lawfulness of Motsoeneng\u2019s million-rand pay-rise. We cannot sit back and allow Motsoeneng to wreck the SABC and be rewarded handsomely for doing so. Issued by DA", "source": "Polity.org.za"}
