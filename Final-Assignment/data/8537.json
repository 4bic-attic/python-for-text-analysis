The 3.5W QSFP28 transceiver is compliant to \n      both the CWDM4 and CLR4 specifications and follows the production \n      release and general availability of the first to market Source Photonics \n      QSFP28 LR4 and LR4 Lite announced earlier this year. Featuring \n      proprietary low power EML-based technology, the QSFP28 operates to 10km, \n      allowing\u00a0a link budget of 6.3dB while not requiring FEC. The\u00a0longer \n      reach and\u00a0higher link budget capability will enable the transceiver to \n      be used in\u00a0otherwise\u00a0dispersion limited environments and provide \n      additional flexibility to deploy longer fiber routing inside the \n      datacenter on the CWDM grid. \n\nSource Photonics\u00a0has designed\u00a0the new CWDM4/CLR4 QSFP28 product on the \n      same product and manufacturing platform as the LR4 and LR4 Lite \n      versions, enabling rapid manufacturing ramp and leveraging existing \n      manufacturing assets. With availability of the QSFP28 CWDM4/CLR4, LR4, \n      LR4 Lite and CFP4 LR4/OTU4, Source Photonics can offer a complete suite \n      of single-mode 100G solutions for inside datacenter, datacenter \n      interconnect, routing, and client side transport applications. \n\nFor more information about this product, please visit our booth number \n      302 on\u00a0September 28-30, 2015 at the ECOC show in Feria Valencia in Spain. \n\n About Source Photonics  \n\nSource Photonics is a leading global provider of innovative and reliable \n      technology that enables communications and data connectivity, in \n      next-generation mobile and fixed-line access networks, in metro \n      networks, and in data centers.
