Redwings r\u00f8dvingetrost were fairly obvious (and have been heard passing at night and around dawn the last few days), a small flock of Brambling bj\u00f8rkefink, Guillemot lomvi, Razorbill alke, Red-throated Diver sm\u00e5lom etc etc all on the move today.\nThe very black upperparts of this bird make me think this must be a good candidate for a real fuscus A relatively interesting gull passed too - as good a candidate for Baltic Gull (fuscus) as one can get - completely black upperparts with no contrast on the upperwing at all.....\nAt dusk a Woodcock rugde flew in and landed in the garden - early for a migrant.", "source": "\u00d8ygarden Birding"}
