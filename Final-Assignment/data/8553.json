Well, they\u2019re at it again! In an effort to get as many people running the city as possible, Odlo has developed a fantastic 10km route that showcases some of London\u2019s most iconic sights. \n \nThe route begins at Surrey Quays, leading you along the banks of the River Thames, all the way through to the heart of central London. After winding your way to Tower Bridge, you then head north of the river and make your way towards Monument. There you\u2019re greeted by the sight of London Bridge and the impossible tallness of The Shard from across the river. Racing along Victoria Embankment, the route then takes you across to the Strand and all the way up to Trafalgar Square. After being greeted by Nelson\u2019s Column, you then speed down to the most famous of all London\u2019s sights, Buckingham Palace. Give the Queen a quick wave as you go, then head towards the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben for more of the capital\u2019s finest landmarks. This kick-ass route finishes up at the gorgeous Southbank, in the shadow of the glorious London Eye. Take in the spectacular views as you celebrate finishing the final leg of your 10k. This route is so interesting and exciting to run that it won\u2019t even feel like you\u2019re training! \n \nOdlo has posted a video on its website of a runner completing the route, to give you more of an idea of the breath-taking sights you\u2019ll witness on this amazing run. This is an intermediate route, which can be made more intense by adding in some exercises that the Odlo team suggest in the video. If you really want to push yourself, why not try some step ups at Surrey Quays? Or pull-ups at the palace? \n \nThis brilliantly British route is perfect for avid runners who are looking for a fresh new run that\u2019s filled with fantastic views. Or, if you want to start a little slower, why not come down and try out our 5k route in Hackney first? Odlo has promised that more awesome routes are to come, so watch this space. \n \nTo find out more information about Odlo\u2019s new routes, check out odlo.com", "source": "We Heart Living"}
