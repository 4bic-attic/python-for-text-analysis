But he also says he doubts very much it will pass.\n\n\"Nothing they can do with the lottery is going to bring in any money quickly enough to resolve the problem that they've got going,\" said UAB political analyst Larry Powell.\n\nThat problem is at least a $200 million shortfall in the general fund budget. The governor has proposed $260 million in new revenue including things like a cigarette tax and eliminating FICA deductions on state income taxes.\n\nHowever, to this point, lawmakers have been focused more on making cuts.\n\n\"We've got to fundamentally change the way we budget in this state. And I truly believe that we're close,\" said Bentley.\n\nOthers like Rogers are not so optimistic. He predicts a bare bones budget.\n\n\"Do some cuts. And then vote to override the governor's veto, if he vetoes it. And then come home,\" said Rogers.\n\nDefinitely not the long term fix, the governor wants.\n\n\"A big band-aid that might fall off at any time,\" said Rogers.", "source": "WFXG FOX 54"}
