He discussed Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's immigration policy proposals and more. \n  \nMexico\u2019s most prominent human rights icon, Father Alejandro Solalinde, traveled to Tijuana on Tuesday to discuss the vulnerability of migrants on both sides of the border. \n \nThe Catholic priest tackled everything from alleged human rights abuses by authorities in Mexico to the immigration policy proposals of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. \n       \nIn an event at the Tijuana border research institute El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Solalinde said he thinks Mexico\u2019s current administration has the worst human rights record in recent history. \n \n\u201cAs long as this government is in power, there will be no real hope for the human rights of migrants, of journalists, or us, their defenders,\u201d he said. \n \nMexico\u2019s President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto received international praise during his first year in office as he implemented sweeping economic reforms . But a series of corruption scandals and massacres revealing government collusion with drug cartels has provoked widespread criticism of his security policies. \n \nSolalinde said officials in Mexico rarely investigate complaints of human rights abuses by authorities. \n \n\u201cThey deny involvement totally,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you show them (evidence).\u201d \n \nMigrants from Central America are the most vulnerable to forced disappearances, killings, beatings and other human rights violations because of their relative anonymity, he said. He said complaints of abuses at the hands of officials from Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute are not uncommon. \n \n\u201cPrevious governments had many defects, but there wasn\u2019t so much persecution against journalists, defenders and migrants,\u201d he said. \n \nSolalinde said he has received death threats, but that his reputation as public figure offers him some degree of protection. He was one of the most vocal critics of the administration\u2019s response to last fall's disappearance of 43 students in southern Mexico, which sparked protests across the globe. \n \nAt the conference, Solalinde also lamented the Tijuana mayor\u2019s decision to remove hundreds of migrants from a homeless encampment known as El Bordo. Many of the people who were living there were deportees from the U.S. In March, they were placed en masse in drug rehabilitation centers , according to city officials. But hundreds are missing. The government has not responded to requests for information on how it determined which migrants needed rehabilitation or on the location of the missing. \n       \n\u201cWe are living an inferno in Mexico, not to mention Tijuana,\u201d Solalinde said. \u201cEl Bordo is an example. The deported population is an example. Before, you could see them. Now, they\u2019ve been disappeared. We don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d \n \nSolalinde also criticized Trump\u2019s immigration policy proposals, such as his call to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and to deport everyone living in the country illegally. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s useless to talk to or try to dialogue with those kinds of people,\u201d Solalinde said of Trump. \u201cBecause they\u2019re closed-minded. They have no values. I would encourage (migrants in the U.S.) to resist. To prepare themselves. Because someday, migrants are the ones who are going to be holding the reins in the U.S. as well as in Europe.\u201d \n \nCarlos Mora \u00c1lvarez, president of the Migrant Attention Council for Baja California, echoed the priest\u2019s sentiments at the conference. \n \n\u201cTrump\u2019s proposals are unrealistic,\u201d Mora said. \u201cMr. Trump has no idea what it would mean to try to build a wall on the border. He\u2019s ignorant of the reality at the border, and of the origins of his own country. Every major country in the world, such as the U.S., such as Mexico, has been built on the foundations of migration.\u201d \n \nTo conclude the conference, Solalinde praised El Colegio de la Frontera Norte for its research on migrants in Mexico, which has helped highlight the problems they face. \n \nHe urged researchers and other community members not to rely on officials for justice, but to join forces with nonprofits and religious organizations to fight impunity on behalf of migrants and other vulnerable individuals. \n \n\u201cWe are all migrants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all just passing through life.\u201d", "source": "KPBS"}
