In 2013, Dr. Anderson became the first surgeon in Georgia to offer hair transplant surgery with the ARTAS\u00ae system, a physician-guided robotics technology that enables surgeons to perform follicular unit extraction (FUE) procedures with an unprecedented level of precision, accuracy, and consistency. \n\nToday, the Capillus272 serves as an ideal complement to ARTAS surgery, offering patients safe, proven, and effective way to heal and protect their new head of hair. \n\n\u201cHair loss is not curable,\u201d explains Dr. Anderson. \u201cIt is a progressive, life-long condition. If you are going to go invest time and money in surgery, you need to protect that investment.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, physicians are recommending low level laser therapy, or LLLT, to adults who suffer with hair loss. In both men and women, LLLT has been shown to stimulate circulation and cellular respiration across the scalp by way of safe, non-invasive laser light. This bio-stimulation draws blood, nutrients, and oxygen to each individual hair follicle, helping to create a thicker and fuller head of hair. \n\n\u201cCapillus is a convenient method of laser therapy that patients can use in their own homes,\u201d says Dr. Anderson. \u201cI like it for patients because it has the most number of lasers compared to competing laser caps.\u201d In virtue of having more lasers, Capillus272 is capable of greater laser light output, which results in greater bio-stimulation for stabilizing and nurturing hair follicles. \n\n\u201cIn terms of non-surgical hair loss prevention, Capillus272 can be used with anything. Propecia\u00ae, Rogaine\u00ae, even hair transplant surgery. It increases cellular respiration, which is like sending your hair to the gym.\u201d \n\nMost importantly, Capillus272 is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hair loss. In clinical trials, Capillus272 demonstrated the ability to increase hair counts by up to 51%. \n\nThe Capillus272 laser therapy device is now available for patients at the Anderson Hair Sciences Center. Dr. Ken Anderson welcomes patients to learn more about this exciting new FDA cleared laser cap, designed for hair loss treatment at home, at work, or on-the-go.
