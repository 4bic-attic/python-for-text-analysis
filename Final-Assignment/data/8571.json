He was about to travel to the US where he planned to urge law enforcement officials to investigate the sovereign fund that Mr Najib set up and oversees through a management committee.\n\nKhairuddin Abu Hassan, who turned against Mr Najib last year, was taken into custody last Friday and charged with attempting to undermine democracy.\n\n\"This was a blatant abuse of power,\" his lawyer, Matthias Chang, said.\n\nMr Khairuddin had said he had sent documents to the FBI and had travelled to European and Asian capitals to spur investigations into Mr Najib's dealings.\n\nMr Najib has resisted relentless calls to resign, including from stalwarts within his party led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nAs pressure has mounted, Mr Najib has attempted to consolidate his position by appealing to ethnic chauvinism and Islamic fundamentalism, critics say.\n\nThe Prime Minister last week refused to condemn a Malay supremacy rally during which his supporters shouted racist slurs at Chinese and Indian minorities, inflaming racial tensions.\n\nMost Malaysians are ethnic Muslim Malays.\n\nMeanwhile, the daughter of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, said she would fight allegations that she attempted to buy stolen data on 1Malaysia Development Berhad.\n\nNurul Izzah Anwar said the allegations \u2013 given prominence in Malaysia's government-controlled media \u2013 were an attempt to \"vilify and to tarnish me\" to deflect attention from Mr Najib.\n\nMs Nurul has been in the US lobbying the Obama administration to pressure Malaysia's government to release Mr Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, who is serving a five-year jail sentence on what he calls trumped up sodomy charges to cripple his political career.\n\nMr Anwar's health has deteriorated in an isolated cell where he is allowed few visitors.\n\nHis jailing has been condemned by many countries and human rights groups.\n\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter Follow FairfaxForeign on", "source": "Murray Valley Standard"}
