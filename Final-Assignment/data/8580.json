This report shows that there are still practices to expose, systems to reveal, and questions to be answered,\u201d said Matthew Rice, Advocacy Officer of the privacy watchdog. \n\n\u201cColombian citizens have for many years suffered from seeing their law enforcement and security services acting against principles of democracy and interfering with their right to privacy. Once again we have seen a key Colombian institution, the Directorate of Police Intelligence, shown to be operating outside the law since 2005,\u201d Rice continued. \n\nColombian authorities and politicians have long been involved in wiretapping and hacking email accounts, including even that of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in May 2014 by experts working for the election campaign of the opposition Center Democratic Party. It was also revealed in 2014 that in an attempt to sabotage on-going peace dialogues between the government and FARC guerrillas in Havana, Colombian military intelligence hacked communications between journalists and the FARC. \n\nPrivacy International\u2019s report shows that this invasive practice is far from unique by highlighting that in 2011 the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) had to be dissolved after revelations the agency had been spying on journalists, judges, opposition politicians and human rights activists who were critical of the government of then-President Alvaro Uribe. \n\n\u201cAfter all the serious scandals that have shocked the country and many promises about tightening the control over intelligence and police activities, we learn that Colombian authorities, indeed, have mass surveillance capabilities over mobile and Internet communications,\u201d said Carolina Botero of the Bogota-based Karisma Foundation - a civil organization dedicated to supporting and disseminating the good use of the technology available in digital environments. \n\n\u201cAs we stand now, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a long way ahead for the compliance of intelligence and criminal investigation activities with human rights standards and for us, as civil society, to keep our work pointing out these abuses,\u201d she added. \n\nPrivacy International\u2019s report also found that Colombian authorities have used overlapping technologies to eavesdrop on citizens that has resulted in a far from robust security of private information that is highly susceptible to abuse. \n\n\u201cThis news points out serious problems of transparency of and control over expenditures on intelligence activities, besides the obvious lack of legitimacy of deployment of mass surveillance systems in Colombia,\u201d said Juan Diego Casta\u00f1eda of Karisma Foundation. \n\nMonday's report was part of a two-part assessment of Colombia's intelligence apparatus. Part two is scheduled to be released Wednesday. \n\nBy Richard McColl", "source": "Turkish Weekly"}
