Here are some favorites I've found:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4173\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"200\"] This shirt means \"She Is Strong\" and I love it. Website: ETSY[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4174\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"] Equal parts sassy and true. LOVE IT. Website: ETSY[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4175\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"] I'm not even an extreme hiking-girl but this shirt is really great. Website: HUMAN[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4176\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\"] With winter just around the corner, I can relate with this sweater. Website: HUMAN[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4177\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"185\"] YES to eating well, working hard, loving truly, and traveling often! YES also to this website, often sited by my favorite blogger (Katie Did What) Website: Riffraff[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4178\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"185\"] More things I love - a white porch, an ocean view, a cozy blanket and espresso! This dreamy sweater reminds me of something [Katie Did What] would wear. Website: Riffraff[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4179\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\"] But am I right? I really would wear this one. Website: Thuglife[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4180\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\"] Because I have LAKE HAIR even when I'm not at the lake. I've been into the \"natural\" look, OK? Website: Thuglife[/caption]\n\nWhat favorite graphic T's have you found?\n\nXOXO.sarah", "source": "sideshow"}
