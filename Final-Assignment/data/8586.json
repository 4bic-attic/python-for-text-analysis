Depending on the track, another round of potential heavy rainful may result in flooding.\nInitial projections had the storm touching the Southeast, but that forecast was later changed to show its path pointed toward the Eastern tip of North Carolina by Sunday afternoon.\n\u201cConsensus has rapidly formed that tropical weather impact risk has escalated sharply, and is now abnormally high,\u201d Gary Szatkowski, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in New Jersey, wrote on his Twitter account.\nMore from Lacey Patch Considering College?
