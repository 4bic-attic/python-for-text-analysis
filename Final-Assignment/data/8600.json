I wasn't really excited about the first one, so that's why it took me quite a while to stop and watch the second one. I've made a review on the first one, in case you would like to read it, just click here.\nAnyways, the movie is about the characters of a 1960's musical movie that end up going to the real world in the present time.\nYes, I liked this one more than the first one. It still has it's cheesy parts just like the first movie, and the songs are in the same level of coolness, but the story itself is better.\nThe actors are the same and even though they don't take me off my seat for a superb acting, it still is good acting. I'm not an expert on how to film stuff, so I normally don't talk about how movie or series were filmed, but since this post will probably be short I'll just say that there didn't seem to be anything wrong with the way it was filmed and all the special effects, even though it's not much comparing to some other movies, it was good.\nOverall, it was a nice movie. The songs make you want to bob your head along to the beat. It's a nice, fun watch. I do recommend it to all the Disney fans and to all of those that liked the first movie.\nSo I guess that's all for now. Until next post!\nBye bye An", "source": "Shia's Kotatsu"}
