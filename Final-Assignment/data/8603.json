One I sort of liked back when I first cropped it, but never felt OK about posting. I fooled around with its focus and color saturation this morning and think it's more OK than not now. However, I go back and forth about the crop. Does it balance that full rose's eye-catching center shapes? Or do they outweigh their framing? I.e., make it look a wee bit out of balance visually. I have other much closer in crops that I've posted on my blogs. But really wanted to retain the full bloom in at least one version, with its little partnering bud. So I'll live with this question.\nNOTE: In most browsers you can click on a photo to view a larger version.
