This week, a Lancaster County Sheriff's Deputy found a note on their vehicle's windshield from a grateful citizen, thanking them for their service to the community.\rBut, Wendy Holmes, of Norfolk, took her appreciation to a more expansive level, spontaneously inviting people to the Norfolk Police Department for an impromptu showing of respect. Holmes said the recent killing of an officer in another state spurred her into action.\r\"Something inside of me snapped,\" Holmes said, \"and it's interesting what snapped. All I could think of was I'm so glad, I'm so grateful to live in this community.\"\rIn response, more than 100 people showed up to applaud and talk with city police, an emotional moment for officers.\r\"To walk out that door and see all those people standing out there,\" Bill Mizner, Norfolk's Chief of Police, said, \"and then they started clapping, and it really tugs at your heart.\"\rHundreds of people also rallied in Omaha this week as part of a #SupportBlue movement. Officer's spouses, law enforcement and others came together to thank area authorities.\rNo matter the setting, or number of people involved, the appreciation is being met with gratitude.\r\"We decide what our community is,\" Holmes said.\r\"We make that decision, we set the tone, we make that culture. And I knew that I wasn't alone.\"", "source": "KOLNKGIN - Home - Headlines"}
