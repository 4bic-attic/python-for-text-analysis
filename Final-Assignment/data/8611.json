We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world.\r \n\n\"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\"\r \n\nThe UK is one of the powerhouses in the culture sector, with London alone boasting three of the 10 most visited museums and galleries in the world, including the British Museum, National Gallery and the Tate Modern. The new co-operation between the BBC and the UK\u2019s institutions could expand these numbers and drive further visitors to Britain\u2019s cultural hubs.", "source": "Attractions Management"}
