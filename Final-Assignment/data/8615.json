MyCheck\ntransforms the guest experience through real-time loyalty rewards,\nordering ahead, and splitting or paying checks from a smartphone, using\nPaypal, Google Wallet, Apple Pay, credit or debit cards. By seamlessly\nintegrating RIUA donation capabilities, the MyCheck platform further\nstrengthens restaurant customer engagement and goodwill by elevating\nhospitality brands\u2019 commitment to charitable giving. \n\nThe MyCheck platform enables diners to donate to RIUA charities via\nbranded restaurant mobile payment apps by selecting \u201cRound It Up\u201d when\nviewing their live bill, which then automatically increases their total\npayment to the nearest dollar. The amount to be donated to the\nrestaurant\u2019s chosen charity is the monetary difference between the\ndining bill and \u201cRounded Up\u201d amounts. Because MyCheck is integrated with\npoint-of-sale systems (POS), a restaurant\u2019s daily POS report tracks\ntotal RIUA donations, which are subsequently submitted to RIUA on a\nmonthly basis. RIUA restaurant partners currently fund over 100\ncharities, including Operation Homefront, Feeding America, Make A Wish,\nNo Kid Hungry \u2013 Share our Strength, Big Brothers Big Sisters, American\nRed Cross and the ProStart, among others. \n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to partner with MyCheck, whose mobile payment platform\nmakes it just one click to donate to a worthy cause,\u201d said Michelle\nMcCarthy, COO, Round it Up America. \u201cWe look forward to growing our\ndonations through MyCheck and its major restaurant brand partners across\nthe country as it continues to help them create compelling and engaging\ncustomer experiences.\u201d \n \nIn addition to being a platform for the American public to donate to\ncharity, Round It Up America\u00ae serves as a vehicle for participating RIUA\nrestaurants, known as Mission Partners, to easily increase company\ngiving. Mission Partners simply select up to three charities each year\nto be recipients of their patrons' donations. While individual donations\nmay be nominal, their collective sum is powerful. Small change can\nindeed make big change. \n\n About Round It Up America  \n\nRound It Up America is a nonprofit organization that strives to make\nchange across America through a simple, yet powerful charitable giving\nprogram.
