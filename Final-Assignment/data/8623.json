Looking back, it's been a long battle. He never complained. He told me his nine-plus years with the condition made him a better priest,\" his brother said. \"He ministered to the sick as a priest, and he said could better understand what they were going through.\"\nThe monsignor consulted physicians at Johns Hopkins Hospital and had two bone marrow transplants.\nIn 2010, he was named rector of downtown Baltimore's Basilica of the Assumption.\nA year later, the building shook as an earthquake struck the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\"You expect an old building to require ongoing maintenance, but an earthquake is just not on your radar screen,\" he said in a 2013 Baltimore Sun article, which added that those present said the whole building shook. Monsignor Valenzano was driving on Interstate 95 at the time and arrived a bit later. The news account said he entered the building to see something bizarre.\n\"The pews were covered in plaster dust. It looked as though it had snowed,\" the monsignor told The Sun, adding that he looked up and observed what appeared to be hairline cracks in the ceilings.\nWhen the $3 million restoration of the basilica was completed in 2013, he told The Sun, \"You know how people say you don't appreciate what you have until you've nearly lost it? It's true. I'm blessed to work at [the basilica], and I'm excited for the repairs. I'll never take it for granted again.\"\nThe Archdiocese of Baltimore has announced a schedule of services and visiting, all to be held at the Basilica of the Assumption, 401 Cathedral St.\nA vigil Mass will be observed at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday.
