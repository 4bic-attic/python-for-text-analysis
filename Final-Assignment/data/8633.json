As an intern for the PartySafe team here at UC Berkeley, I have found that to be very evident, and am proud to share my personal experiences along with PartySafe\u2019s tips and resources with party goers and party throwers interested in changing UC Berkeley\u2019s party culture for the better. We advocate core principles for partying, such as \u201cbe yourself\u201d (choosing how you want to drink or not drink while out and not assuming how much others drink), \u201csee something do something\u201d (noticing warning signs of over-intoxication and preventing harmful situations), and \u201cavoid a party foul.\u201d It all amounts to respecting the community around you. PartySafe offers ways for students to have positive experiences while partying at UC Berkeley, which I found extremely appealing after hearing about so many tragic, alcohol-related incidents last year. \n \nI was moved by the Aug. 28 op-ed entitled \u201cThe importance of student change on campus life,\u201d as it gave recognition to student groups like PartySafe which works not explicitly to eliminate drinking but rather to improve parties and reduce their negative consequences. Rather than pressing binding policies and mandates upon student groups, we feel the solution is to offer tools, tips and resources to drink safely. We encourage all students to support and encourage one another to make individual decisions while drinking, to speak up when something seems wrong or unsafe and to observe and intervene in situations with our fellow Bears to prevent that dreaded call to the paramedics. \nSierra Westhem is an intern for Tang\u2019s PartySafe organization and a UC Berkeley sophomore. \n \nContact the Opinion Desk at opinion@dailycal.org and follow us on Twitter at @dailycalopinion .", "source": "Daily Californian"}
