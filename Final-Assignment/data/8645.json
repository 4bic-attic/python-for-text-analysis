However, security and compliance monitoring tools have not kept up and often represent the single largest remaining hurdle to continuous delivery. \n \nIn their session at DevOps Summit , Justin Criswell, Senior Sales Engineer at Alert Logic, and Ricardo Lupo, a Solution Architect with  of Chef, will discuss how to successfully integrate security controls in your DevOps program. \n \nTopics covered in this session include: \n Principles of security and overcoming challenges in pure DevOps environments  How DevOps provides control and visibility that improves your security posture  \n\n \nSpeaker Bios: \nJustin Criswell is a Senior Sales Engineer at Alert Logic and has over 11 years' experience in Enterprise IT solutions. Additionally, he is also a subject matter expert for complex deployments of network, system and application security.

As the  innovation cycle accelerates, companies must embrace rapid and constant  change  to both applications and their infrastructure, and find a way to  deliver speed and agility of development without sacrificing reliability  or efficiency of operations. In her Keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley, Victoria  Livschitz, CEO of Qubell, discussed how IT organizations can automate  just-in-time assembly of application environments - each built for a  specific purpose with the right infrastructure, components, service,  data and tools - and deliver this automation to developers as a  self-service. Victoria's keynote included remarks by Kira Makagon, EVP  of Innovation at RingCentral, and Ratnakar Lavu, EVP of Digital  Technology at Kohl's. \n \nDevOps Summit Was a Terrific Event! \u25b8 Here \n \n[embedded content]  \n\n \nNoOps != No Operations \nDownload slides \u25b8 Here \n \nShipping  daily, injecting faults, and keeping an extremely high availability  \"without Ops\"? Understand why NoOps does not mean no operations. Agile  development methodologies require evolved operations to be successful. \n \n\n \nIn his keynote at DevOps Summit Silicon Valley,  David Tesar, Microsoft Technical Evangelist on Microsoft Azure and  DevOps, discussed how Microsoft teams that have made huge progress with a  DevOps transformation effectively utilize operations staff and how  challenges were overcome. Regardless of whether you are a startup or a  mature enterprise, whether you are using PaaS, Micro Services, or  Containerization, walk away with some practical tips where Ops can make a  significant impact working with the development teams. Operational  teams and functions are increasingly more important as the industry  delivers software at a blazing pace. \n \n[embedded content]  \n\n \nDevOps Is Even More Important Than You Think \nThe  move in recent years to cloud computing services and architectures has  added significant pace to the application development and deployment  environment. When enterprise IT can spin up large computing instances in  just minutes, developers can also design and deploy in small time  frames that were unimaginable a few years ago. The consequent move  toward lean, agile, and fast development leads to the need for the  development and operations sides to work very closely together. Thus,  DevOps becomes essential for any ambitious enterprise today. \n \n\n \nThis Lunchtime Power Panel at DevOps Summit was  moderated by Andi Mann, VP of Strategic Solutions at CA Technologies.  Monish Sharma, VP of Customer Success at ElasticBox; Myles Steinhauser,  Software Development Engineer at Blue Box; Victoria Livschitz, CEO of  Qubell Inc.; and Mark Levy, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Serena  Software go beyond the basics in a discussion of why DevOps is not only  important for transformation, but is mission-critical for enterprises  that want to stay in business. \n \nDevOps: Disruptive but Essential in a Cloud Expo \u00ae Universe \nThe widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential. \n \nThe DevOps Summit 2015 New York and Silicon Valley will be held: \n \nDevOps Summit 2015 New York \n(June 9-11, 2015, at the Javits Center, Manhattan) \n \nDevOps Summit 2015 Silicon Valley \n(November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center) \n \nDevOps Summit, June 9-11, 2015, at the New York Javits Center in the heart of world's financial capital, will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of time enterprise IT professionals spend putting out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality. \n \nDevOps Summit content doubled in November from a single track last year in New York to two simultaneous tracks: \"Dev\" Developer Focus and \"Ops\" Operations Focus ,  as well as high impact keynotes attended by over 1,000 delegates. \n \nWe'll see you in New York City!

Cloud companies have demonstrated how they can manage massive pools of IT infrastructure, giving the developer a very flexible resource pool that they can leverage and IT is eager to do the same. \n \n\n \nDevOps Summit 2015  New York Call for Papers Now Open \n \nCall for Papers for DevOps Summit 2015 New York is now open.
