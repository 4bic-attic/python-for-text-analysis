Lydia and Caty are enjoying gymnastics. \u00a0They seem to like all the tumbling. \u00a0And there is a lot of carts and wheels going on.\n\u00a0They both wore their leotards all day on Monday. \u00a0Lydia isn't really enjoying her Duct tape camp, but she's still doing a few of the projects. \u00a0She made a little house this week.\n\u00a0Caty spent the week practicing math facts, because she is moving into tougher addition problems. \u00a0So I let her do some practice. \u00a0She loves math, and it gave me a bit of a break and she still thinks math is fun...lol\nLydia wanted to do some of the color-by-number fact sheets too. \u00a0She liked the fall theme from Super Teacher Worksheets.\nShe also did a refresher on fractions.\nCaty and I are reading and learning about birds right now. \u00a0She is enjoying this refresher, and I just keep adding some extra information that we haven't learned before. \u00a0This is one of the books we read this week.\nIn Science we learned about atoms. \u00a0The kids made \u00a0atoms.\n\u00a0We saw this on Facebook, we thought it was funny.\nI was happy that they got the joke...lol Lydia's cheer squad had a party to celebrate the end of their season. \u00a0Lydia made cupcakes for the party. \u00a0She is getting better at reading a recipe before she starts cooking it. \u00a0\nThe girls and I spent some time Friday getting the living room ready for fall. \u00a0It's my favorite season. \u00a0Last year we spent it in the DC area, and I loved seeing all the colors. \u00a0This year we'll be home most of fall. \u00a0So I was excited to pull out decorations.\nOne project we did was the\u00a0Pinecone Zinnia Pinterest project. \u00a0It's a very tedious project, and the girls got bored quickly.\nHere are some of our finished pine cones.\nI ordered\u00a0table top easels from Amazon. \u00a0These are so cool, and take up so little space when storing them. \u00a0I only intended on ordering 2, but accidentally ordered 3. \u00a0So I guess instead of sharing those two, I will probably order a 4th so they each have one. \u00a0But I love how they fold flat and store under the extra desk in our living room right next to the art supply drawers.\nThis week the girls did a doodle project from this\u00a0Usborne drawing book. \u00a0They really had fun with it, and we are going to keep going through it to practice some fine motor skills in fun ways.\nFor our geography study this week, we learned about the state of Vermont. \u00a0We learned about the Monarch Butterfly, Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys, and also about ice cream since Vermont is the home of Ben & Jerry's. \u00a0They each had to create their own kind of ice cream, name it and then design a carton for it. \u00a0We watch the Curiosity Quest on Ben & Jerry's. \u00a0Brayden loved this project. \u00a0He kept telling people about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\nLydia made Cocoa Fields. \u00a0It is chocolate ice cream base with strawberries and chocolate chips added.\nBrayden made Butter Brick Road.....It was a chocolate ice cream base with Butterfinger pieces, mini Reese's pieces, and PB Chips.\nJoey made Sunny Day....He used a coconut milk vanilla ice cream base and added Sunbutter and jelly. Must add whipped cream.\nCaty made Rocky Crusher....It was vanilla ice cream with caramel bits, Snickers, Butterfinger pieces and mini M&Ms.\nIn History we started a unit about Vikings. \u00a0We had chicken stew for lunch one day. \u00a0The kids were not huge fans of it, but I thought it was yummy. \u00a0More leftovers for me! \u00a0Here is the recipes that a friend shared with me......Viking Recipes\nOne of the documentaries we watched:\nHow did the Vikings get to North America:\nand we were\u00a0searching around this BBC website. We didn't cover as much as I wanted because life got really busy, so we will be spending two weeks learning about them. \u00a0Next week we'll finish up about clothes, writing system, Gods and even possibly build a longboat from cardboard. This week we started our first cooking club. \u00a0Some friends go to archery the same time we do, so we figured we would get together every week beforehand to do something. \u00a0For the next few weeks, we will be cooking. The kids made a fruit tray and homemade jelly this week.\u00a0 The lunch spread of homemade jelly and peanut butter sandwiches and their fruit tray.\nThey had fun playing with their friends and can't wait until next week. \u00a0 We had typical riding and archery also this week. Being silly at Kroger...they are all excited about the new Star Wars movie. Brayden fell in love with \"Spicy and sweet\" BBQ sauce this weekend. \u00a0Caught us totally off guard. Hope everyone had a great week!! \u00a0See you next weekend when we finish up week 17. \u00a0It's already looking like it could be an interesting week.", "source": "Krazy Kuehner Days"}
