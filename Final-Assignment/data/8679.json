We strongly urge teachers and parents not to use children to carry out their own agendas,\" Otto warned. Extra security was visible at the school as from Friday.\"\n\nEarlier last week, the Luthuli Park school governing body headed by Clifford Mohloana, showed up at Luthuli Park Combined School dressed in ANC and South African Students' Congress clothing during an oversight visit at the school by the DA.\n\nAccording to DA Limpopo Leader, Jacques Smalle, Mohloana added to an already hostile situation by confronting one of the school's heads of department (HOD) and chasing the HOD off the school premises.\n\nSmalle said the DA has pressed charges against Mohloana and provided the Polokwane police with tangible proof of crime instigation.\n\n\"The DA is not surprised by the ANC-supported Mohloana's behaviour, after he together with a group of ANC-branded SGB members disrupted my oversight visit to the school last week and completely disregarded education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe when he attempted to intervene telephonically.\n\n\"The DA's Vision 2029 envisages schools as sacred institutions of learning where our children are guaranteed safety and intellectual growth, they are not on any terms sites of political struggle or warring factions.\"\n\nReview attempted to contact Mohloana for comment and by the time of going to print, no comment had been received. \n[caption id=\"attachment_89033\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1094\"] For more breaking news visit us on ReviewOnline and CapricornReview or follow us on", "source": "Look Local"}
