He and Hough began their relationship in February 2014. \r \n  \nAt the reception Sunday, Hough's brother Derek said he \"couldn't be happier for the two of them.\" \n\"I knew that it was happening within the first month they were dating,\" the DWTS pro told PEOPLE of the couple's plan to walk down the aisle. \"It was one of those things where it was instant and that smile and glow she's had hasn't dimmed ever since she met [him]. That's a special thing.\" \r \n\n With reporting by MATTHEW COLE WEISS", "source": "People"}
