I was fascinated to learn that GANT has been making shirts since 1949, the Diamond G collection is a testament to the company\u2019s origins as shirtmakers and my Pinpoint Oxford Fitted Shirts is one of the best fitting, slim shirts I have ever worn.\u00a0 For my London Fashion week look I styled it with my Marrakesh flared jeans and a statement bag to keep the look modern.
