Hence, they are more sensitive to the passage of time.\nAs for in the money (ITM) warrants, given that a large part of their value is made up of intrinsic value, they are less sensitive to the passage of time, and such sensitivity decreases as the maturity date gets nearer.", "source": "Bullbear Buffett Stock Investing Notes"}
