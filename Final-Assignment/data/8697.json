The included Fluke Energy Analyze Plus software provides detailed analysis of energy consumption and power quality and generates reports automatically. \n \nThey feature an optimized user interface, flexible current probes, and an intelligent measurement verification function designed to reduce measurement errors by digitally verifying and correcting common connection errors. Set up can be further simplified by powering the logger directly from the measured circuit. \n \nThe Fluke 1736 and 1738 are the first three-phase power loggers designed to work with the Fluke Connect \u00ae system of software and wireless test tools.\u00a0 Fluke Connect tools allow technicians to wirelessly transmit measurement data from their test tools to their smartphones for secure storage on the Fluke Connect \u00ae Cloud and team access from the field.* With the Fluke Connect smartphone app, the data from the power loggers can be viewed from a safe distance, reducing the need for protective equipment, site visits, and check-ins. \n \nFor more information on the Fluke 1736 and 1738 Three-Phase Power Loggers, visit: www.fluke.com/powerquality . \n \nFor information on Fluke tools and applications, or to find the location of your nearest distributor, contact Fluke Corporation, P.O.
