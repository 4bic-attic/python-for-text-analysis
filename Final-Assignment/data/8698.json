A young Moorhen \u00a0 I saw 2 sets of Grebes but unfortunately they were all in the middle of the lake however I tried to capture them on video.(See below)\nCLICK HERE if the video does not appear. You may remember when I visited Mount Stewart in April I\u00a0 videoed the Mute Swans sitting on a nest of 7 eggs and I am thrilled to report that\u00a0 all 7 hatched and are doing very well. \u00a0There is a Mallard and Coot in the background. Coot Mallard (female) I did take some video of all the Swans and I will show you that on Friday but aren't the droplets of water on this cygnets' feathers just wonderful. Now here is the whole family. This is a male Mallard in eclipse plumage. Tomorrow we will continue our tour of the inside of the house when you will see a video of Lord Londonderry's Study\u00a0 as well as taking you on a walk into the beautiful gardens. I am linking this post with WILD BIRD WENESDAY. Thank you for visiting and also for leaving you kind comments.", "source": "Birding For Pleasure"}
