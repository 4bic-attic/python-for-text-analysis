And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),\u201d he added. \n \nAsia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday. \n \nHigher rates would tend to strengthen the greenback, and could severely hurt emerging markets as investors draw their cash out and turn to the US looking for better, safer returns. \n \nThe South Korea won rallied a day after the Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings agency raised the country\u2019s credit rating. The dollar fell to 1,176.03 won from 1,186.32 won Tuesday in Tokyo. \n \nThe greenback also fell to Sg$1,3997 from Sg$1.4035, to 4.2513 Malaysian ringgit from 4.3053 ringgit, to 46.67 Philippine pesos from 46.77 pesos, and to Tw$32.50 from Tw$32.57. \n \nHowever, it rose to 66.4375 Indian rupees from 66.4373 rupees, and to 36.00 Thai baht from 35.98 baht. \n \nThe Australian dollar bought 71.61 US cents Wednesday in Tokyo, up from 71.22 on Tuesday and well up from the six-year lows below 69 cents touched last week. \n \nThe Chinese yuan fetched 18.88 yen against 18.18 yen. \n \nThe post appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria .", "source": "The Guardian Nigeria"}
