Sharing some design team inspiration. I hope all is well in your little neck of the woods and you are getting some craft time.\n\u00a0 Today I have a page to share using the beautiful banner \"Forever and always banner shape\" \u00a0I also used one of the arrows \"Precious\" from Sweet love set of 4 arrows. To decorate the Precious banner I first painted it with Kaisercraft paint and then in a black pen went over the engraved words Precious. I then added the heart and then covered in Diamond glaze and gave a wee sprinkle on top of a soft pink glitter. \u00a0Till next time.\u00a0 Happy crafting", "source": "A2Z Scraplets"}
