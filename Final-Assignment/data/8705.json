In her first official appearance since July (talk about Royal thirst!), the Duchess of Cambridge visited The Anna Freud Centre , the first child psychoanalytic centre launched by, you guessed it, Sigmund\u2019s youngest daughter back in the 1940s. During her visit, the Duchess viewed development plans for the centre\u2019s forthcoming complex and even donned a pair of galactic (and/or geriatric) looking 3D glasses, while playing an interactive learning game with the centre\u2019s pupils. \n \nAs per usual, the Duchess looked stellar for the occasion, pairing a black and white houndstooth shirtdress by Ralph Lauren Black Label with her Mulberry Bayswater clutch and Stuart Weitzman\u2019s aptly named Power pumps. Her relatively new bangs (they were first spotted last week ) were as swingy as ever, taking in an impromptu upswing with the gusty winds outside.", "source": "Fashion Magazine"}
