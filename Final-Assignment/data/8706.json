But Wednesday night was the exception, as CBBC celebrated its 30-year anniversary. \n  \n#CBBCis30 trending 2nd, after Her Maj, won't argue with that! Here we all are! pic.twitter.com/ZuuOF9YC4o \n \n\u2014 Toby Anstis (@tobyanstis) September 9, 2015 \n  \nYep, they\u2019d brought back all the presenters of yesteryear (and if you ever wondered what a room full of 30 kids\u2019 TV presenters looked like, this was a chance to find out). \n \nPeople were getting seriously nostalgic, as the channel\u2019s average viewer age shot up. Some of the former children getting excited about the Broom Cupboard years must be, what, approaching 40 now? \n \nBut the passion for watching Phillip Schofield, Andi Peters, Gordon the Gopher and the rest doing silly things in a tiny room has never dimmed. \n  \nAwesome memories\u2026Peters, Crane, Schofield, Wilson the Butler, Gordon T Gopher\u2026 #CBBCis30  #broomcupboard \n \n\u2014 Charley Woo (@TheWoohan) September 9, 2015 \n  \nBring back to the broom cupboard!! #CBBCis30 feeling so old @SimonParkinITV  @Schofe  @andipeters  pic.twitter.com/zllrk5q6PK \n \n\u2014 lucylou (@lucylovesrobbie) September 9, 2015 \n  \n#Cbbcis30 I loved the Broom Cupboard.  They don't make programs like Maid Marian and her Merry Men any more!  I also remember Art with Hart. \n \n\u2014 JULZ HALLMANN (@TENACIOUS2005) September 9, 2015 \n \nAlthough there will always be those hipster kids (who didn\u2019t even know they were hipsters in the early 90s). \n  \nWait, no clips here from the pre-1994 Studio A they used for Sundays & holidays? It wasn't just the broomcupboard! @cbbc  #CBBCis30 \n \n\u2014 James (@jamesthedog2001) September 9, 2015 \n \nAnd yes kids, this was the height of zany fun back in the day! \n  \nLoving #CBBCis30 Edd the Duck & @andipeters and #Gordon & @Schofe just brilliant although my kids think it looks rubbish #notaste \n \n\u2014 Helen Brooker (@brookerh) September 9, 2015 \n \nAll the slightly younger (but no less adult, by now) viewers were also catered for as the live anniversary show went on. \n  \nI may not be 30 but it's good to see loads of presenters there from 10-15 years ago too. Gemma, Andrew and Barney! #CBBCis30 \n \n\u2014 Zoe Welch (@ZoeWelch1) September 9, 2015 \n  \nBlue Peter, Tracey Beaker, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Raven, MI High, Mona the Vampire, THE BASIL BRUSH SHOW! I loved CBBC! #CBBCis30 \n \n\u2014 Aaron Nelson (@aaronwrotethat) September 9, 2015 \n  \nWhoops whoop!!! #CBBCis30  pic.twitter.com/xiOzhqpGAb \n \n\u2014 Ortis Deley (@OrtisDeley) September 9, 2015 \n \nAnd then it got super weird as CBBC presenters from all different eras started interacting. It was like someone had broken the matrix \u2013 but with big bold primary colours! \n  \nSo much fun @cbbc  #CBBCis30  @tvskirsten  pic.twitter.com/hfeW8ZIqPO \n \n\u2014 Toby Anstis (@tobyanstis) September 9, 2015 \n \nSome informative viewers gave an insight into where some of the kids\u2019 TV stars had ended up. \n  \nThe crazy thing is\u2026 Simon Parkin now reads our weather sometimes! How'd that happen lol #CBBCis30 \n \n\u2014 Millardy (@Millardy73) September 9, 2015 \n \nMeanwhile this accolade was revealed to a shocked Angellica Bell. \n  \n@angellicabell the longest serving @cbbc presenter? Wurk gurrrl. #cbbcis30 \n \n\u2014 Jean Johansson (@JeanJohansson) September 9, 2015 \n \nPhillip may be infamous for having drunk from the fountain of youth. But it was quite staggering how good even the older CBBC presenters were still looking. \n  \nOh my goodness!!! @andipeters hasn't aged AT ALL!!! #CBBC  #CBBCis30  @cbbc \n \n\u2014 Alex Winters (@alexwinterstv) September 9, 2015 \n  \n@realchrisjarvis doesn't appear to have aged..

Starting with Schofe and Gordon the Gopher. \n  \nWho's watching along? RT if so! #CBBCis30  pic.twitter.com/3LkBlVOxr1 \n \n\u2014 Gordon The Gopher (@GordonTheGopher) September 9, 2015 \n \nThen of course there was Edd the Duck. \n  \nCaught up with Edd the Duck backstage. He's excited! At least\u2026 we think he is. He's quacking a lot anyway #CBBCis30  pic.twitter.com/1kh8BKnlAB \n \n\u2014 CBBC (@cbbc) September 9, 2015 \n \nWhich raised this important question\u2026 \n  \n@andipeters is ed the duck still your best friend #CBBCis30 \n \n\u2014 Rachie /rach (@rachandre76) September 9, 2015 \n  \nHonestly, Edd the Duck aggressively quizzing @andipeters about whether he's famous yet: my TV highlight of the year!
