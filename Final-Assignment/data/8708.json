The new spiky router named RT-AC5300 is ultra-fast and provides speeds up to 1Gbps for connections higher than 2.4 Gigahertz (GHz), and a maximum of 2.167Gbps on each pair of 5 GHz bands. \n\r \nAll that technical jargon might be lost in translation and therefore simply put the Wi-Fi router will provide speeds which are almost 2/3rd higher than the current speeds provided by top of the line routers. All of this is possible because of the newest Broadcom Wi-Fi chip which the unit will have under its hood. \n\r \n\u00a9 Twitter \n \r \nBut what would we do with such high Wi-Fi specs? If it can do what it says then this router would be a god-sent for online video games, 4K resolution streaming, smart home device network and chrome cast streaming. \n\r \nThe eight detachable antennas make this piece of tech truly monstrous and they will come bundled with the device when it starts shipping at the end of this year. \u00a0The price range of the device is about $400 and Asus expects good demand for the product in the market at those prices.", "source": "MensXP.com"}
