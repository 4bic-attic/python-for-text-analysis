He has been Microsoft\u2019s general counsel since 2002 and became an executive vice president in 2011.CEO Satya Nadella announced the appointment in an email to employees. Nadella said he wants Smith to play a bigger role in strengthening Microsoft\u2019s relationships and representing the company publicly. Smith will help lead the company on issues like privacy, security and accessibility, he said. Smith, 56, joined Microsoft in 1993 and has held several other titles, including company secretary. \nSmith is a familiar face for investors because he has been a regular presence on the company\u2019s investor conference calls for almost a decade, said industry analyst Katherine Egbert of Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt is interesting that they would put him as president of the company because he doesn\u2019t come from the operational side,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a promotion of someone who\u2019s been a solid executive for them for a long time.\u201d \nShares of Microsoft Corp. rose 19 cents to $43.48 on Friday. The stock is down 7.5 percent over the last year. \n \n\u2014AP \n Share this: \r\n\r\r \r\r\n\r\r\n  \r Microsoft names Brad Smith president, chief legal officer", "source": "Gulf Time UAE"}
