About 11 percent reported they had been raped. \n\nAt UW-Madison, 27.6 percent of women who responded to the survey said they experienced sexual assault, with 12.6 percent reporting they had been the victim of a rape or attempted rape. \n\nThe perpetrators of those assaults were overwhelmingly male and fellow students, according to the survey, and were often acquaintances of the victim. \n\nAll UW-Madison students were invited to participate in the AAU survey last spring; about 22 percent of them, more than 9,000 students, did. About 60 percent of the 9,000 respondents were women. \n\nThe vast majority of women who said they were raped never reported the assault to UW-Madison or law enforcement officials, according to the survey. \n\nIn the case of rapes where a perpetrator used force, only about one-quarter of women reported the assault. \n\nLess than 10 percent of women who were incapacitated when they were assaulted \u2014 those who were asleep or under the influence of drugs or alcohol \u2014 made a report. \n\nUW-Madison is among scores of universities being investigated by the federal government for alleged mishandling of sexual assault complaints, something Blank acknowledged Monday. \n\n\u201cI would very much like to believe that we are doing a better job now ... as people have come to understand more about sexual assault and how it occurs and how we reach out to students,\u201d she said. \nConfidence mixed \nFemale students expressed varying degrees of confidence in UW\u2019s ability to handle reports. \n\nTwo-thirds of undergraduate women said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d confident university officials would treat a reported assault seriously. \n\nSlightly fewer, about 53 percent, said they thought the university would conduct a fair investigation of the incident. \n \nFewer still believed officials would take action against the perpetrator, with only 39 percent saying they were confident that would happen. \n\nWhile officials noted UW\u2019s efforts to support survivors, they also stressed the importance of preventing sexual assault and stopping perpetrators. \n\nSarah Van Orman, executive director of University Health Services and the chairwoman of the task force that reviewed the survey results, said UW-Madison plans to expand a mandatory program for incoming students about consent and how to intervene as bystanders to prevent assaults. \n\nStarting next fall, Van Orman said, everyone living on campus or in fraternities or sororities \u2014 where the survey found assaults took place at disproportionate rates \u2014 will have to take part in the program again each year. \n\u2018Everybody\u2019s issue\u2019 \nUW-Madison graduate student Valyncia Raphael, another member of the survey task force, said she has seen progress in how officials and others at the university discuss sexual assault since she first came to campus as an undergrad. \n\nBut she said in order to reduce the number of assaults, people must no longer see sexual assault as a problem that only affects those who are more likely to be victims of it, such as women or lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender students. \n\n\u201cThis is everybody\u2019s issue,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cIf someone is victimized, that\u2019s a family member, that\u2019s a friend, that\u2019s a classmate. \n\n\u201cUnderstanding how intrusive sexual assault is to anybody, even if they haven\u2019t been victimized \u2014 I think that\u2019s going to be the key to getting more people to understand and to change their behavior,\u201d Raphael said.", "source": "Chippewa Falls Online"}
