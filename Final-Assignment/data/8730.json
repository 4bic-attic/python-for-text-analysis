It was raining but we really didn't care. We packed a small backpack and hit the unpaved road. It was so nice to take time away from the Goddess Garden. We walked slowly and took in our beautiful surroundings. Our legs were covered with mud from our flip flips but we were happy.\u00a0 Along the way we passed a few small homes and places to stay. Everything was hidden from the road and tucked in amongst the trees. The road followed the beach all the way into town and listening to the waves crashing was amazing. We really had no idea what we were looking for and how long it would take to get to Cahuita. We were told that we would reach town once we hit a paved road. We passed the cutest little reggae bar and a couple of open air restaurants before we finally hit pavement.\u00a0 We really only had enough time to walk around for a bit and check out the one or two stores. I had promised one of my co-workers who had been to Costa Rica that I would try an ice cream treat called Trit that he had fallen in love with. A few of us split one and it was divine. We took a group cab back to Goddess Garden happy and refreshed.\u00a0 Mrs. E", "source": "Meet the Eliuks"}
