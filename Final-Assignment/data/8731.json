Colleen Gallagher, who is seeking class-action status for the legal action, filed suit in the US District Court for Northern California on Aug. 28. Court documents show Denver-based Chipotle is being accused of violating California\u2019s Consumer Legal Remedies Act, False Advertising Law and Unfair Competition Law. \n\nA spokesman for the company declined to comment on the lawsuit but did say the company plans to contest Gallagher\u2019s claims. \n\nThe complaint states that Chipotle has crafted its public image through marketing better-for-you food options to health and environmentally conscious consumers, who in turn, buy Chipotle\u2019s products because the company\u2019s food production standards align with their values. Those same consumers also are willing to pay premium prices for its food. \n\nBut while Chipotle has represented to its customers that company\u2019s restaurant don\u2019t serve meals containing GMO ingredients \u2014 and reaping financial rewards on Wall Street \u2014 Chipotle has known all along that its claims of being \u201cG-M-Over it\u201d were false, according to the lawsuit. \n\n\u201cAmong other things, Chipotle serves meat products that come from animals which feed on GMOs, including corn and soy,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cChipotle\u2019s tacos and burritos are also usually served with sour cream and cheese from dairy farms that feed animals with GMOs. And, Chipotle also sells Coca-Cola and other soft drinks that are made with corn-syrup \u2014 a GMO. \n\n\u201cWhile Chipotle knows that its menu contains ingredients with GMOs, it takes no meaningful steps to clarify consumer misconceptions in its advertisements and on its billboards, both in stores and in print, which instead say \u201call\u201d of the ingredients used in its Food Products are \u201cnon-GMO.\u201d A \u201cChipotle meal was, and remains, the very definition of a GMO meal\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cConsumers today are very concerned about what they eat, and restaurants know that consumers place a premium on food that is considered to be healthy or natural,\u201d Laurence D. King, an attorney for the proposed class, said in a news release announcing the lawsuit. \u201cAs a result, Chipotle\u2019s advertising in its stores should have accurately informed customers about the source and quality of its ingredients and should not mislead consumers that they are serving food without GMOs when in fact they are.\u201d \n   \nChipotle Mexican Grill notes that its meat and dairy products come from animals fed some GMO feed. \n  \nIn April, Chipotle announced it would use non-GMO ingredients at its restaurants, including the company\u2019s ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen. The company began listing GMO ingredients in its food and pledged to move to non-GMO ingredients for all of its food. The company said at the time that consumers did not see higher prices on the menu because the switch to non-GMO ingredients didn\u2019t significantly impact ingredient costs. \n\nThe company said it replaced corn-based ingredients with non-GMO versions, and all of its soy-derived ingredients were replaced with rice bran oil and sunflower oil. The corn used in its salsa has always been a non-GMO variety, and the tofu used in its Sofritas is made using certified organic soybeans. \n\nThe company\u2019s website also states that meat and dairy products served its restaurants come from animals that are not genetically modified. However the Chipotle notes that meat and dairy products may have come from animals \u201cgiven at least some GMO feed.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are working hard on this challenge, and have made substantial progress: for example, the 100% grass-fed beef served in many Chipotle restaurants was not fed GMO grain \u2014 or any grain, for that matter,\u201d the company states on its website which also notes that beverages sold at its restaurants contain GMO ingredients. \n\nGallagher is seeking unspecified damages for \u201cChipotle\u2019s deceptive conduct.\u201d She lives in Piedmont, Calif., and claims she bought food from Chipotle based on the company\u2019s claims of \u201cFood With Integrity,\u201d according to court documents. \u201cPlaintiff would not have purchased from Defendant at the price she had paid, or purchased it at all, had she known that the representations made concerning Defendant\u2019s Food Products were materially false and misleading,\u201d the complaint stated. \n\nIn addition to certifying the lawsuit as a class action, Gallagher is seeking to prevent Chipotle from continuing to advertise its food as non-GMO and award plaintiffs experts\u2019 fees, attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs associated with pursuing the lawsuit. \n\nThe case is Gallagher v.
