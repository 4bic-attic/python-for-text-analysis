Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduced the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth. \n\nAcquisition related items for the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2015 \n\nOn April 7, 2015 \n\nIn September 2013 \n\nReconciliation of EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS with Net Income\n\nWe believe EBITDAS is an important valulation measurement for management and investors given the increasing effect that non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization related to acquisitions and depreciation of capital equipment, has on the Company's net income. In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same atypical items as previously described as adjustments to net income . We use Adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating the operating performance of the Company because we believe the exclusion of such atypical items, which a majority are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period. \n\nReconciliation of Debt with Net Debt \n\nWe define net debt as long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Each of the components of net debt appears in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors because we review net debt as part of our management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage. \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cantel-medical-reports-record-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-ended-july-31-2015-300150360.html\n\n\u00a92015 PR Newswire.
