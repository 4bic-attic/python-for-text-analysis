There would not be many Griffith residents who don\u2019t remember when Tony Abbott promised irrigators he would not support a Plan that would negatively affect district residents. However, there is no doubt the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was formulated by John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull and implemented by the Labor Government, has done just this.\n\nMr Abbott was ousted by Malcolm Turnbull on Monday night.\n\nAustralians awoke to the shock announcement that Mr Abbott had lost the support of his party.\n\nGriffith residents should now demand the new Prime Minister reverse the impacts of the Plan he had a part in shaping.\n\nIrrigators are faced with difficult decisions every single day because of the Plan.\n\nOften they have to take a chance and plant the same number of crops from last year and hope water allocations will increase.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t happen they are forced to spend tens of thousands of dollars on water or watch their crops die.\n\nOn behalf of Griffith and district residents, I encourage Mr Turnbull to come and talk to irrigators about how the Plan has affected them and how the government can help ensure the district has a prosperous future.\n\nI think the government owes irrigators that much.\n\nIt needs to act before it\u2019s too late.\n\n- MONIQUE PATTERSON", "source": "The Area News"}
