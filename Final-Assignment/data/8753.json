It didn't faze him. He grew more as a player. \n \n\"The ball is his friend. He takes it to bed with him. \n \n\"It's great because street football isn't the same anymore. \n \n\"When I was growing up, I used to come home from school and go straight out to play football then my mum used to call me in and that doesn't happen anymore. \n \n\"Jack is a product of street football.\" \n \nGrealish started Tuesday evening's derby match with Blues on the bench before being introduced at the interval. \n \nIt proved an inspired choice as the Solihull-born No.10 was at the forefront of his side's attacking play and a focal cog in turning the clash in Villa's favour. \n \nSherwood was pleased with the mature response from Grealish. \n \nHe added: \"I didn't tell him he wasn't starting. \n \n\"They have an idea when we work on shape and how we want to play. \n \n\"He knew he'd come on but didn't know when. \n \n\"It was obvious when it was ready for him. \n \n\"He reacted exactly how you want people to react in those games. \n \n\"He didn't sulk, came on with a point to prove, and rolled his sleeves up. \n \n\"That'll do for me son!\" \n \nSnap up MATCH TICKETS for Villa v Stoke.", "source": "Aston Villa FC"}
