Instead of rebuilding on land, the Astins decided to pursue a different type of fresh start \u2013 at sea. The family of four has been living on their sailboat for the past three years, playing music as Stell and Snuggs, and loving the adventure. It was a treat having Jarad, Christel, Arden and Riley on the show to hear their incredible story. \n \nWhat inspired the decision to live on a sailboat? \n \nWhile living on a sailboat might seem a long way from reality for most, it was already an important part of the Astin\u2019s life. Jarad tells us that sailing had always been important to them \u2013 they bought their own boat in 2005, and had alwasy loved spending time on it as a family. \u201cWe loved it\u201d says Jarad, and \u201cwe always thought about doing it down the line.\u201d Luckily, that same boat survived the storm, and when the family lost their place to live, they were presented with a freeing opportunity. \u201cWe had no lease, nothing holding us back\u201d says Jarad.
