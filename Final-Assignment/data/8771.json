He changed his rating from \"Neutral\" to \"Neutral/High Risk\", which is as close as you can get to a \"Sell\" without being a \"Sell\" . \u200b \n \n\"We rate Twitter High Risk because its high multiple (23x CY16 EBITDA) creates risk for significant multiple compression,\" May wrote. \"In addition, Twitter's shares have proven to be especially volatile relative to other Internet stocks.\" \n \nTwitter\u00a0shares were trading at around $25.60 on Thursday, down 4.5% from the previous day. \n \nGoogle Finance Twitter shares are worth half of what they were worth in April. \n\n \nMay is particularly concerned with Twitter's inability to get people to engage with its ads.\u00a0 \n \n\"Because we believe Twitter\u2019s ad load has little room to increase in the US, achieving such an increase in monetization will largely depend on the company\u2019s ability to drive higher pricing and click-through rates,\" said May in a note to clients Wednesday. \"We believe this is unlikely and are lowering our US ad revenue forecasts accordingly.\" \n \nThis assessment, according to May, is derived in part from what Twitter management has recently been saying. \n \n\"Management also recently acknowledged that if Twitter is unable to grow its audience and increase engagement, revenue growth could be impacted by limited ad availability,\" wrote May. \"We believe this implies that Twitter\u2019s ad load, at least in the U.S., does not have room to meaningfully ramp from here.\" \n \nHere's Mays' formula that lead him to his numbers: \n \nCiti \n\n \nTo break down what is admittedly a jargon-packed chart, May\u00a0multiplies 5 numbers: \u00a0 \n Change in monthly active users . This is the metric used by social media companies to track how many people are using their platforms.  Change in timeline views per active user . May says this is a\u00a0stand-in for\u00a0how long people spend on the platform.   Growth in impressions . This is the number of people seeing ads on Twitter.   Change in click-through rate . This is the percent of people actually clicking on the ads.   Change in cost per impression . This is basically how much advertisers pay for ads.  \nBased on extensive\u00a0calculations derived from\u00a0Twitter's financial statements and recent comments\u00a0from management, May determined\u00a0that the first two numbers\u00a0\u2014 user growth and time spent on Twitter \u2014\u00a0are unlikely to grow enough to generate the revenue to hit the consensus forecasts. This means it comes down to the 3 monetization numbers. \n \n\"In the absence of a meaningful acceleration in user growth or user engagement, it appears we need to have a meaningful acceleration in ad engagement (i.e., CTRs) and/or in ad pricing to meet or exceed current revenue forecasts,\" said May. \"We do not have confidence in making that assumption today.\" \n \nInternational ad revenues, wrote May, are achievable, but the numbers are low and have room to grow. \u00a0But his\u00a0total ad revenue estimate, is now around 7% below consensus forecasts. \n \nIn an environment where nothing is looking positive for Twitter, underperforming on ad revenue as May predicted is not\u00a0going to make the outlook for the company\u00a0any better. \n   SEE ALSO:  Instagram is leaving Twitter in the dust      NOW WATCH: The full story of Jack Dorsey is much more awesome than you realize     Please enable Javascript to watch this video", "source": "Silicon Alley Insider"}
