He is also calling for a multi-faith, multi-party international working group to be set-up immediately to develop the safe havens. \n \n\u201cThe USA and the EU should have acted over four years ago to prevent this crisis and they should now take full responsibility for the biggest refugee crisis since WWII. UN agencies and INGOs should make greater efforts to provide safe havens inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries. If they can\u2019t do this, then they should take measures to accommodate the refugees,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to turn away from the issues at hand, but to work hard and solve the root problems. We can\u2019t let more young children drown as they try to escape a living hell.\u201d \n \nHuman Appeal is one of the biggest and most well known charities working in and around Syria, having helped millions of refugees. It houses hundreds of families within sheltered communities and 40 safe-havens in the region - mostly in Jordan. The charity is also helping Syrian refugees who've crossed into Macedonia.\u00a0 \n \n\"The countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, on the borders with Syria are bearing the real burden of this crisis. This is where aid and support needs to be channelled,\" says Moqbel. \n \n\u201cThe aim should be to keep families fleeing conflict together in a safe place away from the fighting. If refugees cannot find a safe sanctuary near their homeland they are pushed into the hands of traffickers. Even if refugees survive the trafficking ordeal they still face an uncertain future when they have to be dealt with by European governments. \n \n\"Despite recent comments the growing migrant crisis is not just a German problem,\u201d says Moqbel. \"It is also a UK problem and a European-wide problem and Europe has a responsibility to the countries much closer to the conflict zones.\" \n \nThere is a very strong argument that many European countries - including the UK - should be taking in more refugees. However, a vast majority are far better protected by finding shelter in an area designated a safe haven. This is not about creating vast unmanageable refugee camps. Human Appeal and many other charities have already demonstrated that a 'safe haven' can work. \n \nHuman Appeal's safe haven programme is based on small communities - which they call villages. These 'villages' are organised to keep families and their own familiar communities together.", "source": "Asians.co.uk"}
