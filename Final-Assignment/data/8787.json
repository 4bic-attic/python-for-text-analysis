Admissions are run by the local authority. \n \n\u201cHowever, over the past three years we have been able to accommodate, in the end, every first-choice student. \n \n\u201cSome are rejected initially and in 2013 we decided to create an extra form of entry to accommodate the large numbers involved, but in the other years, every student who chose to go on the waiting list gained a place here for September.\u201d \n \nOne of the key reasons for the improved figures for secondary schools is down to Calthorpe Park, which increased its pupil admission number from 224 to 254 as a result of its expansion programme. \n \nA statement from Calthorpe Park headteachers Martin Amos and Melanie Hooper read: \u201cCalthorpe Park School is in the final stages of a multi-million-pound expansion project as part of Hampshire County Council\u2019s investment to ensure sufficient spaces to enable Fleet children to be educated in Fleet schools. \n \n\u201cThe additional provision allows the school to undertake a staged growth from a previous 210 admission number through 224, up to 254 this year and 284 in approximately two years\u2019 time. \n \n\u201cThe school has worked closely with the local authority to enable a smooth transition, both through the physical growth and the increase in student numbers. \n \n\u201cA new hall and welfare area is already completed; 14 additional classrooms, a new learning resources centre and reception \u2013 all are planned for completion before Christmas. \n \n\u201cThe school is delighted to be a part of this exciting development and, in partnership with the local authority, will continue to support all parties to ensure, along with our neighbours, Court Moor, the highest quality of education across the town.\u201d \n \nHampshire County Council was unavailable for comment.", "source": "Get Hampshire"}
