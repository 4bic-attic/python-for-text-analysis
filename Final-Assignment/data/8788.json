It has become something of a curse word for our society. Often times greeted with a huff or a sigh. As a whole, we don\u2019t like waiting. In fact, I would venture that it can often pull out of us a big, strong emotion like hate. \n \nWe don\u2019t like waiting for anything. Checking out at the grocery store. Oil changes. Meals. Much less something like a job, healing, financial provision, that deal to finalize. Waiting just stinks. It\u2019s countercultural. We live in a \u201cdo and make it happen\u201d world. \n \nIn case we weren\u2019t fully clear on the meaning, Webster\u2019s defines wait this way: \n  \n:to stay in a place until an expected event happens, until someone arrives, until it is your turn to do something, etc. \n:to remain in a state in which you expect or hope that something will happen soon \n:to remain stationary in readiness or expectation \n  \nYes, yes and yes \u2026 right? \n \nRecently our church was challenged with listening to Psalm 23 every night for a period of time. It all started out fun until the words started piercing my heart. \n \n\u201cThe Lord is my shepherd. I lack nothing.\u201d I lack nothing? \n\u201cHe makes me to lie down in green pastures.\u201d Makes? He doesn\u2019t ask me to lie down? What if I don\u2019t feel like I need to lie down? \n\u201cHe leads beside quite waters, He refreshes my soul.\u201d I like the refreshing part, but quiet waters sounds \u2026 well, boring. \n \nLet\u2019s dig deeper. \n \n\u201cI lack nothing\u201d: Here\u2019s the real issue in my life. I look too far ahead and at times I don\u2019t live out that He is enough. I look left and right and all around and see a lot of what I don\u2019t have, a lot of what I think I need and it distracts me from running my race. When the reality is, Jesus is enough. He\u2019s done enough, He provides enough and in this moment I truly have all I need in Him for what He is asking of me. \n \n\u201cHe makes me lie down\u201d: This is the wait. So what am I doing in my season of waiting? Am I accepting this invitation to be still with Him, to see Him and know Him? Or am I anxiously working towards my own plans? \n \nHere\u2019s where it can get painful. Am I worshiping Him? Right now, in this moment, am I choosing to worship Him for who He is and what He\u2019s already done? Or am I waiting until my thing comes or my wait is over to worship? Now is the time. He is worthy of our praise! \n \n\u201cHe guides me along the right paths for His names sake\u201d: Boom. And there it is. His name\u2019s sake. Friends, we\u2019ve been sold a lie to believe that this life is about us. That it\u2019s our time or our moment, our decision to make, that it\u2019s all about us. \n \nActs 20:24 tells us, \n \n\u201cBut my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus \u2013 the work of telling others the Good News about the wonderful grace of God.\u201d \n \nWe were made for His glory and ultimately to reflect Him in every work He brings us to. You are not supposed to run the race of your friend, your neighbor or that random person on Instagram. You and I have our own assignment that\u2019s as unique as each of us. That\u2019s the focus. That\u2019s the goal. Your race for you. My race for me. \n \nWhen I\u2019m restless in the wait, I need to go back and reflect on Whose I am and everything He has already done for me. Like, salvation. People, I am alive in Christ! \n \nHello? \n \nI said \u2013 once I was dead, but now I\u2019m ALIVE! Sing and shout! AMEN! Do I really need anything else? Every single thing beyond salvation is a +1 in our blessings column. He loves us. He saved us. And He longs to bless those who love and serve Him. Believe and walk in that. \n \nThe Lord will work out His plans for my life \u2013 for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever. Don\u2019t abandon me, for you have made me. Psalm 138:8 \n \nSo, perhaps all my anxiousness is really because I\u2019ve placed me at the center of my life. My timing. My glory. When in fact, it\u2019s all about Him. \n \nWill I believe His heart when I can\u2019t see His plan? Will I live for His glory no matter where this journey takes me? Faith believes in the unseen and, in Jesus, it believes the unseen it is good \u2013 by His standards and not mine (Romans 12:2). \n \nI left this verse for last because it\u2019s all too often heartlessly quoted by well-meaning Christians. But hang with me. Read Romans 8:28-30 this way. \n  \n\u2026 we know that in all things God works [Stop. Ponder that.] \n\u2026 to conform to the likeness of His Son [Think on that.] \n\u2026 What shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? \n  \nDo you see? All of this [His work] is so that we can be made like His Son. Every wait, every pain, every delayed happening has purpose. A good purpose \u2013 to make us like Jesus. \n \nDon\u2019t waste the wait!", "source": "Internet Cafe Devotions"}
