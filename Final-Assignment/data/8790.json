More than 1700 people have jumped on board the Bring Kmart to Mudgee A Facebook page \u201cBring Kmart to Mudgee\u201d set up by Gulgong resident Amy Warnes has garnered more than 1700 likes and comments from people around the region who would like to see another big retailer come to town. \n\nNew Gulgong resident Amy Warnes said she started the Facebook page after realising there wasn\u2019t a lot of variety when it came to shopping in Mudgee. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea for the community,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot only will it bring more jobs to the region but it will also provide more variety in town so shoppers don\u2019t have to drive to Orange or Dubbo,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you can\u2019t find in Mudgee.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook page started a couple of months ago and Ms Warnes said she wasn\u2019t expecting it to grow as fast as it had. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting more and more followers each week which I think says something about what people would like to see,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the closest Kmart in Orange, Ms Warnes said it would be nice for people in Mudgee not have to drive that far just to go to Kmart.\n\n\u201cAnd then you get there anyway and it\u2019s not as big as you think it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. \n\nKmart Australia replied to the \u201cBring Kmart to Mudgee\u201d page via Facebook, stating they loved the enthusiasm shown by Mudgee residents. \n\n\u201cWe are always looking for new locations to bring more Australians our everyday low prices. Once a new store has been confirmed, there will be an official announcement via Facebook,\u201d the post said. \n\nMs Warnes said it was great the page had received a reply from Kmart and that they were keeping her in the loop as to what would come from it. \n\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re kind of scoping the region out to see if it would be worth it, which is kind of exciting,\u201d she said. \n\nResidents in Dubbo are also calling for Kmart to open a store in the CBD.\n\nDubbo deputy mayor Ben Shields said despite nearly 4000 people liking a \u2018Bring Kmart to Dubbo\u2019 Facebook page, he didn\u2019t believe Wesfarmers \u2013 owners of Coles, Kmart, and Liqourland \u2013 was thinking seriously about Dubbo as a Kmart location. \n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the executives at Wesfarmers need to get their act together and develop a new, exciting shopping destination preferably in Dubbo\u2019s CBD that incorporates new retailers to compete with their arch rivals Woolworths,\u201d Cr Shields said.\n\n\u201cWoolworths and Aldi see Dubbo as profitable, so why does Wesfarmers lag behind? It simply does not make sense.\u201d\n\nWesfarmers were contacted for official comment but did not respond by the time of print.", "source": "Mudgee Guardian"}
