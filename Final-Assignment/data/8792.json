It\u2019s scheduled to start today, September 16th and will run for one month. \n \nInformation release from Salazar Film: \n Hello friends of WIZARD MODE,   \nWe are so excited to announce the launch of our upcoming crowdfunding campaign to finish our documentary WIZARD MODE! This will be the first feature-length documentary from award-winning film-making team Jeff Petry and Nathan Drillot of SALAZAR FILM . \n \nThe campaign will launch on Indiegogo on\u00a0 September 16, 2015 \u00a0and will run a month long.\u00a0We are hoping, with your help, to reach our goal of $40,000 that will enable us to finish the film with proper editing, colour correction & sound mix in order to express the magic of the game and the spirit of the pinball community. We will have a whole range of fun perks, including rare pinball-related items and exclusive merchandise signed by\u00a0our celebrity supporters! \n \nWIZARD MODE follows\u00a0Robert\u00a0Gagno, a champion pinball player, as he rises up the ranks\u00a0of the international pinball circuit while striving to gain independence and transcend the label of autism. \n \nIn August, we released a short version of\u00a0WIZARD MODE\u00a0as a way to offer you a sneak preview of the upcoming feature-length documentary. The short film has since garnered over 40,000 views on Vimeo, has been featured in numerous publications such as the Atlantic , the well-known art blog\u00a0 Booooooom , and pinballers have shared their stories\u00a0on reddit about competing against Robert in tournaments. We will also be partnering with autism organizations who believe the film \u2014 that represents people with autism as having fulfilling, complicated and challenging lives \u2014 is a powerful way to change the conversation around autism. \n \nWe\u2019re so close to sharing\u00a0Robert\u2019s story\u00a0with you on the big screen! We hope, as the campaign launches, that you share, tweet, post and email the campaign link to your friends & family. \n \nTo watch the short film go to:\u00a0 https://vimeo.com/ 135844794\u00a0 and please continue to follow us on our Website ,\u00a0 Facebook ,\u00a0 Twitter and\u00a0 Instagram \u00a0for all the film updates!! \n \nBest, \nThe Wizard Mode Team \n \n\n  \nFun With Bonus \u00a0is the home of\u00a0the semi-coherent, misguided ramblings of professional and amateur pinball players. \n \n \nFollow on Twitter: FunWithBonus \n Like on Facebook: Fun With Bonus", "source": "Fun With Bonus"}
