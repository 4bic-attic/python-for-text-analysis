Ceremony + Fuss has been a labor of love I have been working on for the past year. C+F is an online gift box shop offering lovingly curated gift boxes to splendidly celebrate life's special occasions. We love making a big fuss! Whether you are showering a new arrival with love, sending best wishes to a bride or letting a friend know you think she\u2019s the best, we are here to help you make a fuss and celebrate! It has been a dream of mine the last couple of years to be able to own my business and still stay home with my boys. Lots of work, lots of prayer and lots of late nights went into this venture, and I certainly could not have done it without the love and support of B, family and friends. Many thanks to all who have supported me along this journey and here's hoping you all will love C+F as much as I do. Happy gifting, friends!", "source": "Pomp and Circumstance"}
