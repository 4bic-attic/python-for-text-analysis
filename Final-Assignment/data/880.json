The result of that kind of feverish fandom, of course, is a torrent of furiously typed, objectively insane comments. \n \nAhead of the release of his upcoming WILD EP tomorrow (September 4) \u2014\u00a0he\u2019ll be walking us through the making of the EP in detail tomorrow, by the way \u2014 we asked the TRXYE singer to sit down and read through a few particular gems from his Twitter mentions and YouTube comments. \n \nThe thirst for new music is real\u2026and it\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019ll require a full security team in Malaysia. \n \nCheck out Troye\u2019s reaction to Stuff Fans Say up top, and be sure to check back here tomorrow to watch him walk us through the making of the WILD EP . \n \n\n \nNext: Troye Sivan to Release 'WILD' EP", "source": "KFOX 95.5"}
