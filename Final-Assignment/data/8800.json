The able cast \u2014 Herman Gordon, Jeffrey Hardin, Samuel Huddleston, Steven Williams Jr., Ronni Gregory, Jennifer Kelly, Alicia Reve Like and Olivia Neal \u2014 just sings. \n\nThere\u2019s no plot, no dialogue. There\u2019s only the eight singers with the five-piece band, dancers Heather Beal and Frankie Watson, racks of period costumes and a sparse Hitsville USA-themed set. Performers belt out memorable soul and R&B songs \u2014 more than 60 total \u2014 mostly from the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s. \n\nAfter opening with the ensemble song \u201cTell Me Somethin\u2019 Good\u201d with the cast decked out in all white, the men grab the spotlight, breaking out to perform the street corner doo-wop of \u201cAdorable,\u201d \u201cMoney Honey,\u201d \u201cCharlie Brown\u201d and \u201cGet a Job\u201d before the women return for \u201cMama Said,\u201d \u201cThis Is Dedicated to the One I Love\u201d and \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow. \n\n\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s much back and forth between the men and women, lots of playful flirting as they zip through the numbers, often performed in medleys with the occasional song getting a full treatment. \n\n\u201cWhen We Get Married,\u201d \u201cC.C. Rider,\u201d \u201cSummertime\u201d and \u201cSitting in the Park\u201d are highlights for the male singers during the first act, but during the end of the first act, the women steal the show, thanks to an Aretha Franklin suite of songs. \n\nIt is kicked off with the Franklin-esque \u201cRescue Me,\u201d a song recorded by St. Louis\u2019 own Fontella Bass. Kelly and Like collectively and powerfully nail \u201cAin\u2019t No Way,\u201d and Kelly and Gregory have their way with \u201cDr. Feelgood,\u201d much to the delight of the crowd. Another crowdpleaser is \u201cI Never Loved a Man\u201d featuring Kelly and Gordon. \n\nThe second act may be the audience favorite because of the many Motown songs that come into play with staples including \u201cMy Girl,\u201d \u201cMy Guy,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself\u201d and \u201cYou Really Got a Hold on Me,\u201d and a Supremes medley of \u201cCome See About Me, \u201cStop! In the Name of Love\u201d and \u201cBaby Love. \n\n\u201d \n\nMuch of the second act features the cast in \u201970s attire as they perform songs such as the theme to \u201cShaft,\u201d \u201cJungle Boogie,\u201d \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d and \u201cSkin Tight,\u201d leading up to material by Earth, Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye and Parliament-Funkadelic. Kudos to Huddleston, Gordon and Hardin for being among those who shine in the second act. \n\nWhile the cast is uniformly good, the show itself is in need of a tweak or two. \n\nThe structural problem that remains with \u201cTell Me Somethin\u2019 Good\u201d is the distribution of the songs and some of the song\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
