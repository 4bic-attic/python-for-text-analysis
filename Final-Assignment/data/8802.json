But (Cueto) wants it. He likes it. The catcher\u2019s job is to learn all those different personalities and make the necessary adjustments to make that guy feel comfortable.\" \n\nCueto also requested that Perez back up off the plate and set his target up later. The 6-foot-3 catcher would crouch down on one knee to help give his pitcher a lower target Friday, but the extra effort from the backstop worked dividends. \n\nAs for why didn't Cueto discuss the issues sooner, Yost explained it had more to do with a stressful transition to a new club. \n\n\"He understood that Salvy\u2019s a three-time All-Star, a three-time Gold Glover,\" Yost said. \"He\u2019s not going to come in and tell him what to do.\" \n\nWith the Royals' cushion for home-field advantage in the playoffs down to two games over the Toronto Blue Jays , they will need Cueto at his best down the stretch. His next start is scheduled for Sept. 24 against the Seattle Mariners . \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc. All rights reserved.
