That is also how we play. The players are used to tough places. \n\n\u201cSouth Africa is not for sissies. We enjoy different cultures. We enjoy meeting and mixing with new and different people.\u201d \n\nSouth Africa have separate captains for all three formats, with Faf du Plessis leading them in Twenty20 cricket, AB de Villiers in one-day internationals and Hashim Amla in Tests. \n\nDu Plessis insisted the arrangement worked perfectly for the Proteas. \n\n\u201cThe three of us play all formats and when one is not the captain, we can enjoy cricket without the extra responsibility. This way we are always fresh. \n\n\u201cIt has worked really well for us. It\u2019s never been an issue, we continue to learn from each other and support each other.\u201d \n\nThe three captains are among only six players who are part of all three squads, the others being all-rounder JP Duminy, leg-spinner Imran Tahir and 20-year-old fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. \n\nDomingo justified the decision to rest pace spearheads Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel from the Twenty20 games to keep them fresh for the one-dayers and the Tests. \n\n\u201cIt is going to be a long tour and we have to decide how to manage our players,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt is tough to be practising day in and day out. And at the same time it offers an opportunity to develop younger players. \n\n\u201cIt is a win-win situation for us because it allows us to look at options and keep players fresh at the same time.\u201d \n\nThe tourists will play a practice Twenty20 match in New Delhi on Tuesday before travelling to Dharamsala for the first T20 international on Friday. \n\nAgence France-Presse", "source": "Oman Tribune"}
