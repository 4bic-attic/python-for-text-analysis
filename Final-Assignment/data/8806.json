(THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Inez Lewis) A plus-size Vancouver model says she\u2019s been boosted by the support she\u2019s received since battling back against cyberbullies who body-shamed her online. Ruby Roxx said she received a link from one of her Facebook followers featuring a photo of the curvy model digitally doctored to make her look thinner. \u201cThe caption that they put on with it was: \u2018Look how much better she looks, she looks so much younger. Imagine how much potential she\u2019d have if she looked like this,'\u201d recalled Roxx, whose real name is Jenn Palsenbarg. \u201cMy initial reaction was I kind of laughed because the Photoshopping was so poorly done and I looked so unnatural \u2014 all of the Photoshopped girls did.\u201d Roxx said she shared the page and image with friends and followers, hoping to have the Project Harpoon account shut down. Inadvertently, she said it made the page \u201cgo viral,\u201d bringing greater attention to their efforts than she had intended. Roxx turned to social media herself as a way to battle back against her online critics. \u201cI am a strong, confident, plus model, who is PROUD of her body,\u201d she wrote in an Aug. 22 blog post on her website, http://www.rubyroxxmodel.com. \u201cIt has gotten me through 31 years, of health, sickness, pain, freedom, love and adventure. My body and I have been through a lot together, and I will not let online bullies such as you make me feel bad about loving myself.\u201d Roxx also wrote candidly about suffering from anxiety and depression, noting that the page put her into a \u201cdownward spiral from which I struggled to pull myself out.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the words that bothered me. But it still got to me,\u201d Roxx said. \u201cI was not my normal, happy, perky self. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. It was affecting my life really negatively.\u201d Roxx said she was buoyed by the support she received from her boyfriend, friends and family as well as the outpouring of encouragement online. \u201cI really don\u2019t think cyberbullying is going to end anytime soon, unfortunately. It\u2019s just kind of the world we live in now. But I just wanted to focus on helping those affected by cyberbullying.\u201d Roxx said the media attention and reports filed about Project Harpoon led to the pages being deleted, but added that new incarnations are emerging under different names. Roxx said she\u2019s talked about pursuing legal action with her boyfriend, who is a lawyer, but \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to go down that road\u201d at this time, believing the process would be emotionally and financially draining. In addition to modelling, Roxx is Editor-in-Chief of Beauty Mark Magazine, a publication she said is devoted to encouraging individuals to find beauty in their uniqueness. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be a body-positive activist. I\u2019ve tried to encourage people to love the skin you\u2019re in.\u201d \u2014 Follow @lauren_larose on Twitter.", "source": "ChrisD.ca"}
