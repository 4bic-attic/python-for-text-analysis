Thereafter, the policy would be finalised in 15-20 days, Raju told newspersons at the airport here. To a question about introducing more international flights, particularly to Coimbatore, Raju said several countries had signed bilateral agreements, but not operated any flights. His ministry would try to negotiate and execute the agreements. On the incidents of collapse of glass panes and false ceiling in Chennai and Goa airports, the minister said \"it was due to shoddy construction.\" \n \nWhen asked whether the ministry would order a probe, Raju said: \"Definitely it is shoddy construction. Why should I investigate. Can you prove that it is not shoddy?\" \n \nAbout the delay in expansion of Coimbatore Airport, he said land acquisition was a state subject and once it was over, the work would begin. Later talking to newspersons in hill resort town of Udhagamandalam near here, he said a meeting scheduled in Delhi on Tuesday would discuss the issue of reducing air fare. \n \nStating that Air India was running in loss, so as some private airlines, like Kingfisher, he said the government was monitoring the situation, but did not elaborate. On introducing helicopter service to the tourist town, the minister said that if the state government sent a proposal in this regard, it would be considered.", "source": "The Echo Of India"}
