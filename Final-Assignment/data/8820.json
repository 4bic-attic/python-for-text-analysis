Mr Masanabo is now correcting the omission. \n\nLance Corporal Jabez Nquza was travelling on board the SS Mendi at 5am on the 21st February when it was struck by a much larger ship in thick fog just off the Isle of Wight. \n\nA total of 616 South Africans, 607 of them black, died as a result. Some died outright, many died after hours of clinging to wreckage in freezing waters. The ship that had hit them did not stay to assist in the rescue. Most of the men that died have no known grave, but Lance Corporal Nquza\u2019s remains were washed ashore in Hastings some months later. They were buried amongst other fallen servicemen in the military plot in Hastings, where his grave has been tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ever since. \n\nCllr Dowling said: \u201cI am very pleased that Lance Corporal Nquza\u2019s name is now being added to the memorial in his home country. The omission appears to have been caused by a simple misspelling, as original papers recorded his name as Lance Corporal Nguza. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cThe least we could do on our return was place the modern flag of South Africa on Lance Corporal Nquza\u2019s grave in Hastings cemetery, almost 100 years after he died.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live. \n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on. \n\n1 Make our website your homepage at www.hastingsobserver.co.uk \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n2 Like our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/hastingsobserver \n\n3 Follow us on Twitter @HastingsObs \n\n4 Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).
