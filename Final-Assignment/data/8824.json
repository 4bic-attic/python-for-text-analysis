Mayer shared that she is likely to deliver twin baby girls in December.\n\n\"Since this is a unique time in Yahoo's transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,\" Mayer wrote in a blog on Tuesday.\n\nThe news however, comes as a jolt for the company which is on the verge of entering and existing new business deals with other giants.\n\nShe was expecting a baby boy when she had joined Yahoo in 2012. The 40-year-old continued to work from home even after the delivery and joined back within a fortnight then.\n\nThe news of Mayer\u2019s current pregnancy has sparked off a debate in the corporate sector over the motherhood bent and work responsibilities.\n\nThe company officials, meanwhile, posted in a blog that they were all set to support Mayer in the venture. She is married to Zachary Bogue since 2009. Earlier, she was an executive with Google Inc.\n\nBeing a family-oriented person, Mayer brought in a number of leave policies in Yahoo. She extended leaves for new parents. As per the new policy on paid leaves, the new mothers were allowed leaves of up to 16 weeks. For new fathers, it was increased to eight weeks. These changes were effective since 2013.\n\nShe was, however, criticized sizably over her decision to disallow working from home. Experts took exception to the policy stating that it affected a number working parents.\n\nCheck out More news from Telecom Sector :: Pharmaceutical Sector :: Auto Sector :: Infrastructure :: Real Estate", "source": "Topnews.in"}
