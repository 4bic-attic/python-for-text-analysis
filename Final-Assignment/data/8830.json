It is a really unique and special opportunity, so very privileged to be chosen to work on it. \n \n\"As a child in the late 70's, Star Wars was\u00a0absolutely\u00a0my most influential pop culture reference when I was growing up. I think if my six-year-old self knew that I'd end up working on this he'd have been pretty amazed.\" \n New edition to the series, Rey, is rumoured to possibly be a Skywalker: here she can be seen with brand new droid, BB-8 \nIncorporated into each stamp is also a secondary scene or character, including the new spherical droid, BB-8. Plus, the typeface used to mark the \"ST\" on the 1st class stamps replicates the iconic typeface used in the films. \n \nMalcolm reveals creating the stamps was quite a\u00a0long\u00a0process, \"I was working with design agency Interabang,\u00a0who had already spent\u00a0a lot of time\u00a0laying out rough versions of the stamps and trying different character\u00a0versions and\u00a0combinations.\" \n A force to be reckoned with...  The original triology's characters were a challenge for Malcolm to capture, due to the low resolution of the original films \nMalcolm replicated some of the most famous screen famous in miniature, which could be incredibly challenging. \n \n\"A lot of the reference shots\u00a0we had were very blurred\u00a0photos from the 70's or super low res screen caps, so\u00a0I had to\u00a0re-create\u00a0many of them into usable highres images, before\u00a0I could start on the final artwork. \n \n\"Although the stamps themselves are small, the actual\u00a0finished artwork was done at about\u00a01000%, so you see a\u00a0huge amount\u00a0of detail, and anything technical\u00a0has to be correct.\" \n \nMalcolm explains that one of the key overall factors was making sure that each stamp works on its own, but also looks consistent and balanced within the set: \"Each\u00a0image has\u00a0its own colour space, so they are easily identifiable individually,\u00a0but\u00a0still work\u00a0together as a whole group. \n Malcolm was happy the bounter hunters made the final cut: Bossk, Dengar and IG-88 can be seen in pride of place on Boba Fett's stamp \n\"It was also important to have a visual consistency with lighting, tone etc.. across all twelve. Lucasfilm has a fantastic\u00a0history of using illustration for their posters and promotional images, so Royal Mail were really keen to continue in that tradition.\" \n \nDespite challenges from a reference POV, Malcolm had a lot of fun with the set. \n \n\"It's always\u00a0fun to work on the\u00a0new characters when\u00a0everything is\u00a0all still top secret. As\u00a0we were\u00a0working with limited information\u00a0though, you're not always sure what context some of the characters have between each other and their environments.\" \n  \nIt's always fun to work on new characters when everything is all still top secret! \n  \nNot all fan favourites could be featured, \"it's actually\u00a0surprisingly difficult to narrow it down to just twelve,\" Malcolm admits, but overall he believes they ended up with a good balance of old and new. \n \n\"I was\u00a0particularly happy that the bounty hunters made the cut, think that one's for the hardcore fans. (Bossk is a bit of nightmare though because his hands don't really work properly!)\" \n \nThe stamps will be on sale from 20 October 2015 here and from 8,000 Post Office branches across the UK.
