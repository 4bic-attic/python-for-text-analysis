But when I first heard about this story, I shed a single tear, looked up into the sky, and whispered \u201cthank you.\u201d Gather round, dear readers, so I may share with you the tale that made me thankful to be a writer \u2014 no, thankful to be a human \u2014 today. \n \nLast week at TomorrowWorld , the EDM-festival-turned-muddy-hellscape , a woman was photographed receiving a rimjob from a man in the middle of a crowd. Much like the fossilized couple found frozen in an eternal embrace , they\u2019ve been immortalized in a photograph: the young gentleman clad in a North Face jacket and kneeling down with his face glued between a woman's\u00a0asscheeks, his fair maid bent over slightly , only identifiable by her glowstick necklace.
