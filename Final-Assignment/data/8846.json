They just want to live the kind of life that we have. And I understand that, but this is impossible. If we let everybody in, it\u2019s going to destroy Europe.\u201d \u201cWhat will it solve if we divide 50,000 or 100,000 migrants among us, when uncountable millions will be on the way?\u201d he asked. His argument has been echoed, the New York Times reports, by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who opposes the mandatory quotas of refugees proposed by Germany and France. About 6,000 people arrived in Munich on Saturday and another 1,800 are expected overnight. According to the AP, Germany expects to receive about 800,000 refugees this year. Photo credit: AP Images.
