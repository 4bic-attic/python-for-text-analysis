Sounds a little like the beginning of a joke your dad would have told during the height of the fondue era, right? Wrong! That\u2019s no joke opener. That was the afternoon after TSheets volunteered at Habitat for Humanity . \n \nI mean, it could also be the opener of a joke. Those fondue parties were full of hilarity, amiright ? \n \nOkay, okay, all \u201cdad jokes\u201d aside, the day spent volunteering at Habitat for Humanity was completely life-changing. There were lessons learned, friends made, and a whole new light shed on how Habitat for Humanity works. \n \nIn addition to spending a day with some brilliantly talented volunteers (no, not just the TSheets Team , the regular weekly volunteers), and learning how to handle a skill saw, we gathered a few life lessons along the way that we are now proud to pass on to you. \n 1. There Is No Free Lunch  \nMany (ok, all) of the TSheets volunteers went into our building days thinking that the houses were built from donated supplies or materials purchased through donations and then gifted to the families in need. Plot twist! Did you know that Habitat actually sells the houses to the families? The families get to buy the home at a reduced cost, with a low interest rate (it\u2019s kept within Habitat, instead of outsourcing to a bank) only after they\u2019ve met certain criteria. The families are also required to put in a few hundred hours building their home, as well as the next home being built in the community. Which leads us to our next life lesson\u2026. \n \nTake note, Webster. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the actual definition of sweat equity. \n 2. It Takes a Village  \nYup. The families Habitat supports get to put their blood, sweat, and tears (of joy) into their own home, and their neighbor\u2019s house. In fact, even after their homes are built and they\u2019ve put in their required hours, many families still come out and put in hours at the other houses being built in their neighborhood. If they\u2019re not able to contribute time, many continue to contribute in other ways. For example, the home buyer on one of the TSheets volunteer days brought in lunch for all the volunteers. \n \nAn authentic, delicious, and well-earned meal during a day of physical labor. \n 3. Anything Worth Having Doesn\u2019t Come Easily  \nRigorous application process aside, building these homes is some serious work. There is a dedicated group of volunteers who come out to the job site two or three times a week to meet with and coach the group of volunteers from the community. In this case, some TSheeters! To be honest, there aren\u2019t words to describe these volunteers. To say they\u2019re patient is to say that elephants are kind of heavy (i.e., a huge understatement). However, after a long day of some very tough work, all of us are now comfortable using a skill saw, circular saw, nail gun, and are competent in the entire window installation process. \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to star in our own Home Depot commercial. \n 4. Home Is Where Your Heart Is  \nIf you\u2019re a regular reader of the TSheets blog, you may have heard us say that, \u201cWe love employees,\u201d and you may also know that our logo includes\u00a0a heart. Basically, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re kind of experts on love. But the amount of love in the frame of this house is absolutely awe-inspiring. The two-by-fours that comprised this home looked more like senior yearbook photos than the frame of a house. Messages like \u201cBless this home\u201d and \u201cA beautiful home for a beautiful family\u201d were lovingly written in permanent ink everywhere. In door frames. Full paragraphs on stairs. Hearts on studs. In short, the inspiring and loving words, to and from complete strangers, were enough to thaw even the most frozen of hearts. \n \nThe grinch ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 on these kind words. \n 5. All Work and No Play Is No Way to Live  \nAfter a day of conquering a fear of heights, wrangling power tools, and installing windows with our new friends, we found their favorite apres-handiwork watering hole, a local BBQ joint called MickeyRay\u2019s . (If you\u2019re ever in Idaho, you should stop by and check it out!) Chatting with this group over a cold beer was the perfect way to end the day. We got to hear some great stories about their favorite volunteer groups and how proud they were of their job site safety record, despite a few volunteers showing up in flip flops and slippers. To top the afternoon off, the owner of the restaurant (who\u2019s named Mickey Ray \u2013 bet you didn\u2019t see that coming!) even stopped by for a quick photo and a chat. \n \n\n \nWe\u2019re not going to tell you that finding some time to volunteer for the Habitat in your community is going to be the best decision of your life (hopefully the photos alone can tell you that), but we will guarantee that it\u2019ll change your life (and another\u00a0family\u2019s) for the better. And that you\u2019ll walk away with a whole new set of life lessons to live by. \n \nAlready volunteer for Habitat?
