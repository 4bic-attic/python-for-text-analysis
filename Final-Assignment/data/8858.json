The festival which was co-founded by McWilliams and Naoise Nunn is set to kick off on November 5. \n \n\u201cI am delighted to announce Yanis Varoufakis will open Kilkenomics on Nov 5,\u201d McWilliams tweeted on Thursday. According to the festival\u2019s schedule Varoufakis will be in conversation with McWilliams in St Canice\u2019s Cathedral in Kilkenny, Ireland . \n \nThe Kilkenomics Comedy and Economic Festival is an economics and comedy festival taking place in Kilkenny, Ireland. Its first session ran from November 11 to November 14, 2010. The festival mocks banking and political figures while asking for answers and it also features its own currency known as \u201cthe marble.\u201d \n \nKilkenomics is Europe\u2019s first economics festival, which brings together some of the world\u2019s leading economists, financial analysts and media commentators with some of our funniest, sharpest standup comedians, write the organizers on their official website. \n \nVaroufakis was replaced as Greece\u2019s Finance Minister after the Greek referendum vote, in July, when he stepped down to make way for Euclid Tsakalotos. He recently claimed that Europe bullied Greece into a bailout at the end of summer 2015, and distanced himself from the recent Greek elections, where SYRIZA\u00a0won with a smaller majority than in January 2015. The former Greek Finance Minister noted that it was \u201ca sad parliamentary election \u2013 which could not, and did not, produce a parliament capable of implementing a viable reform program for Greece.\u201d", "source": "Greek Reporter Europe"}
