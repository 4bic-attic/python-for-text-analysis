Every day that ticks by, it\u2019s a big loss for the company.\u201d \n\nOver the past three months, several reports had suggested that a decision was imminent, but Twitter itself has remained mum on the subject. \n\nThe wait has created frustration for some investors. \n\nOne Twitter stakeholder, Silicon Valley venture investor Chris Sacca, has on two occasions launched \u201ctweetstorms\u201d to voice support for making Dorsey the permanent CEO. \n\n\u201cEnough is enough. The board needs to act. They are running a \u2018process\u2019 yet there is only one person fit to run this company: @jack,\u201d Sacca tweeted on Sept. 11. \n\n\u201cHe has the full support of the key players at Twitter and its largest investors.\u201d \n\nWhile Dorsey would appear to be a natural choice, it is unclear if he is willing to step down from his other startup, Square, or manage to lead both companies simultaneously as the online payments firm readies its initial public offering (IPO). \n\nA long list of potential CEO candidates has surfaced in media reports: Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, AOL chief Tim Armstrong, Intel president Renee James and several Google executives. \n\nInside the company, one frequently mentioned name is Adam Bain, who is overseeing Twitter\u2019s effort at monetization including advertising. Another is its finance chief Anthony Noto, whose Goldman Sachs background could reassure Wall Street. \n\nRob Enderle, a consultant and analyst at Enderle Group, said Twitter\u2019s needs are highly specialized, making the search complicated. \n\n\u201cThe pool they\u2019re pulling from is relatively shallow,\u201d Enderle told AFP. \n\n\u201cThey need a very unique skill set likely only found in places like Google or Facebook, and both firms have circled the wagons around the executives that might take the job.\u201d \n\nWhile Twitter may be looking for fresh ideas, hiring someone without a CEO background is a big risk for the company, according to Enderle. \n\nEnderle said Yahoo\u2019s decision to lure Marissa Mayer from Google to be CEO has failed to deliver the results many had hoped for and that she has become \u201can example of what not to do.\u201d \n\nKerner said some candidates may have rejected the job because of the risks. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find somebody with all the right attributes and experience, and who is ready to step into the fire,\u201d he said. \n\nBold steps needed \n\nBut Kerner said Twitter needs to do something bold to avoid sinking further. \n\n\u201cThe company has been struggling for a very long time,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Twitter\u2019s problem is solved by some minor enhancements. They have got to have a significant product change. The question is how do you change the product so that it\u2019s interesting for a billion instead of a few hundred million.\u201d \n\nThe euphoria around Twitter has faded since its November 2013 IPO. Although it has boosted revenue and engagement, its global user base has struggled to get over 300 million, and it has never made a profit. \n\nTwitter\u2019s share price, meanwhile, has fallen from its initial rise and has been hovering at or below its IPO level. \n\nSome argue that Twitter may not be viable as an independent company and needs to merge or be acquired, but its hefty valuation makes that a difficult task as well. \n\n\u201cWhat they need to do is probably fold underneath another company that has a broad portfolio,\u201d Enderle said. \n\n\u201cThat would be the easiest fix. But it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d \n\nEnderle said the only company currently capable of absorbing Twitter is Google, \u201cbut it would be a crazy purchase, and there\u2019s a chance the regulators wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d Speech", "source": "The Japan News"}
