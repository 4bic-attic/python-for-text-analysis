I couldn\u2019t get it out. I was struggling, one foot was loose, the teeth were getting closer. I had to leap from the shoe. There was no time to save the shoe. I had to save myself.\u201d \n \nThe immobile high heel ended up causing the escalator to stop immediately. \n \n\u201cLouboutin\u2019s are super strong it turns out,\u201d she said. \n \nHowever, she did take some grief for the great shoe incident of 2015. There was a woman behind her on escalator in a foot cast. Brie said, \u201cShe came hobbling down and she was like, \u2018You know, I already have a broken foot!'\u201d \n \nShe thought to herself, \u201cI almost lost a foot myself here. Can I have a little sympathy?\u201d \n \nThe post appeared first on Made In Hollywood .", "source": "Made In Hollywood"}
