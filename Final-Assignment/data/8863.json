The study participants' urine was examined for proteins indicative of atherosclerosis. In the children with kidney stones, higher concentrations of proteins, which are key inflammatory biomarkers, were found in their urine. \n\nAll of the patients in the study were free of markers that would suggest they could develop atherosclerosis as adults. With the association found between kidney stones and hardening of the arteries, however, researchers plan to work to understand the link and take preventative measures against the condition's development. \n\n\"Now that we have a clear indication that the association between kidney stones and arterial thickening or hardening begins in childhood,\" Kusumi said. \"We can take steps as clinicians to treat these vascular symptoms or implement preventive measures, such as exercise and diet programs. \n\nThe study is published in the Journal of Pediatrics \n\n. \n\nUnited Press\u2026", "source": "MyInforms"}
