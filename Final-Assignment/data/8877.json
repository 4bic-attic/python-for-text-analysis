This exciting affair was organised to kickstart Tiger Beer\u2019s new initiative \u2013 Tiger Bites \u2013 which challenges Malaysian foodies to uncage hidden street food havens and let other locals discover these hidden gems as well. \n \n\n \nStreet food is such a huge part of the diverse Malaysian culture and more than anything, it brings people together. Tiger Beer has also put together a street food contest all of you food lovers can be a part of,\u00a0but before that, learn more about our street food trail below: \n \n14 August 2015 \u2013 Day 1 \n \n\n \nBreakfast \u2013 Nasi lemak goreng \n \nBefore we embarked on our street food trail, we had the nasi lemak goreng \u00a0with fried chicken. Unlike the regular dish, frying the nasi lemak \u00a0with spicy sambal intensifies the fragrance and strong flavours that ultimately make the dish\u00a0a winner. \n \n\n \nLunch \u2013 Dry curry noodles at Woh Heng Coffee Shop, Clare Street, Ipoh \n \nEn route\u00a0to Penang, we stopped by Ipoh for dry curry noodles. This noodle dish comes with cockles, bean sprouts, kuay teow and prawns. The hint of lime in the curry sauce, paired with fresh mint leaves, gives the dish its distinctiveness. \n \n\n \nMid-day pick-me-up \u2013 Apom at Apom Guan, Burma Street, Penang \n \nThe apom , which had a sweet corn and soft banana filling, were soft, fluffy and absolutely satisfying. Clearly, one was not enough! \n \n\n \nDinner \u2013 Duck egg char kuay teow at Tiger Char Kuay Teow, Carnavon Street, Penang \n \nNo trip to Penang is complete without char kuay teow , and damn, this was delicious, greasy goodness on a plate. Instead of cockles and chicken egg, this char kuay teow had duck egg and bamboo clams. \n \n\n \nSupper \u2013 Burma Food Paradise, Burma Street, Penang \n \nAs if we haven\u2019t had enough to eat, we ended our day with supper at Burma Food Paradise. We were spoilt for choice and picked out many dishes to choose from, including prawn noodles, o\u2019 chien (fried oyster omelette), lum mee , bak kut teh \u00a0and dim sum. \n \n15 August 2015 \u2013 Day 2 \n \n\n \nBreakfast \u2013 Localised breakfast in bed, The Royale Bintang Hotel, Penang \n \nThe next morning, we were spoiled with a lovely surprise \u2013 breakfast in bed that is! Our grand platter was the epitome of a typical Malaysian breakfast. We had fried lobak , roti canai , ha gao (prawn dumplings), toast with kaya and butter, half boiled egg, and some fruit. \n \n\n \nLunch \u2013 Pitt Street kuay teow th\u2019ng, Carnavon Street, Penang \n \nBefore heading back to Kuala Lumpur, we had the popular Pitt Street kuay teow th\u2019ng. The bowl of kuay teow soup had a mild yet flavourful broth, a generous serving of homemade fishballs which were a delightful treat, and slices of tender pork meat. \n \n\n \nDinner \u2013 Flying wanton noodles, Jalan 21/22, Sea Park, Petaling Jaya \n \nAlas, our journey came to an end after we had dinner Sea Park. To prepare the dish, the wanton noodles are tossed about two metres up into the air, giving it its springy texture we all love. Yum! \n \n\n \nWhile we got a taste of what\u2019s to come, you too can participate in this initiative by creating a trail for others to follow as you uncover hidden food gems through the Tiger Bites microsite .
