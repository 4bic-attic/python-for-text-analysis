The kids these days call it \u201cventing,\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t do it here , but we\u2019re all in this together, and trust me, the payoff is good. So, tally ho! To all those who feel that they need to have early morning work meetings where they can be totally self-centered, churlish, idiotic, preening, demanding, aggressive, annoying, smelly, rude, obnoxious, piggish, full of sophomoric one-up-manship, self-absorbed, beastly, un-jovial, un-jolly, un-jiggy-with-it, grabby, grandstanding, stinky, vainglorious, un-fun, stoopid and stupid, pompous, jealous, vindictive, douche-y, territorial at a level way beyond petty, pushy, primpy, powermad, and just plain fatheaded, to all y\u2019all that fit that \u2013 please, just let me know far, far, in advance when you\u2019re scheduling your morning meetings, so I can make a Morning Call, or two, and thereby just ignore your sorry ass. \n \n\nThe Morning Call, from Ginger Bliss and the Violet Fizz \n \nCracked ice \n1-1/2 ounces absinthe \n3/4 ounce maraschino liqueur \n3/4 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice \n \n1. Fill a cocktail shaker or mixing glass halfway full with cracked ice. Add the absinthe, maraschino, and lemon juice. Stir well, and hang up the phone. \n \n2.
