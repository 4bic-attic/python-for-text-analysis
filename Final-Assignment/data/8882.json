The only problem was many of those questions were completely ignored. The panel was visibly frustrated by this. The debate turned into an ugly affair as many of the candidates started name-calling and touting their records, again ignoring the questions. It reminded me of a song by Judy Collins from many years ago titled \"Send In the Clowns.\" Trump may lead the polls now, but he is a buffoon and will be a non-factor when the race gets serious. It appears to me the GOP has no chance to defeat Hillary Clinton unless a miracle occurs. \n\nWilliam Wright, Seymour", "source": "Knox News Sentinel"}
