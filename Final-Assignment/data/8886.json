We've got great variety in the centres.\" \n\nEight days after lining up opposite Fijian giant Nemani Nadolo, Watson must steel himself for a duel with another colossal wing in Wales' George North. \n\n\"Nadolo was good preparation for North. They are both big players,\" Watson said. \n\n\"They are slightly different - I think George is probably a bit quicker than Nadolo, so he has got that threat there as well. He is a quality player. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"George North is a player I have massive respect for. He is a British and Irish Lion, he has a lot of caps already for Wales, so he is definitely a special player for them, someone we have to be on our money with defensively.\" \n\nWatson has been escaping the pressure-cooker environment of a home World Cup by spending rest days with his family at their home near the squad's Surrey training base. \n\n\"My parents only live 20 minutes from the hotel, so I'm spending most of my free time back at my parents,\" he said. \n\n\"My days off I spend my time there relaxing with them. That's something I really enjoy and nice to have them so close, especially at a time like this. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"I always try to eat the right thing but I can't help myself when I go home and my mum's made some Nigerian food. I always tuck into that.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Wetherby News"}
