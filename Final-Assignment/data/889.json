Jonathan Sacks said it was time for human compassion to triumph in the same way as the scheme that saved thousands of Jewish children before the second world war broke out. He said that a \u201cvery clear and conspicuous humanitarian gesture, like Kindertransport\u201d would help to achieve that aim. \u201cEurope is being tested as it has not been tested since the second world war \u2026 The European Union was created as a way of saying that we recognise human rights, after the catastrophe of two world wars and the Holocaust, and it\u2019s very chilling to see some of these scenarios being re-enacted,\u201d Lord Sacks told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight on Thursday.

The churches, the religious groups, the charities would all join in, and I think we would be better for doing that.\u201d Meanwhile, former home secretary David Blunkett said the UK had a moral obligation to take about 25,000 refugees \u2013 which was still a fraction of Germany\u2019s total. \u201cWe should concentrate on those coming through Turkey, who have been persecuted and ejected from Syria, and we should concentrate on women and children,\u201d he said. While a global response was needed, Blunkett added: \u201cIf we are going to be taken seriously by anybody as a nation in putting that programme together, we are going to have to face the challenge of taking refugees in very large numbers ourselves.\u201d Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring said: \u201cOffering to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees would bring the UK in line with other European countries who have already shown leadership in offering a haven to vulnerable refugees.\u201d He said he hoped that the government would clarify as soon as possible the number of refugees from Syria the UK would resettle and by what date.", "source": "Politics | The Guardian"}
