Pictured is an unauthorized civilian being turned away from a checkpoint \n\nThis paranoia was only fueled when Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, ordered the state's National Guard to monitor the exercise. \n \nHowever, after its controversial beginning, it ended a few days ago with no sign of the 'hostile government takeover' many had suggested, News9 reported. \n   \nGreg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, ordered the state's National Guard to monitor the exercise. \n\nAt the time, Gary Franchi, of the online Next News Network, warned his viewers: 'This is by far the greatest public conditioning exercise in American history. \n\n'U.S. military coordinating with local law enforcement and elements of the willing public will be conducting clandestine activities carrying weapons under aircraft cover at night wearing arm bands with a special insignia.' \n\nMartial law may not happen this summer, Franchi intoned. \n\nBut when the times comes: 'Troops will be ready and trained to take over your town.' \n\nFears came to head at a town meeting in Bastrop, Texas, where people held up signs declaring 'no Gestapo in Bastropo'. \n\nThey also wore t-shirts with the words 'come and take it' under a drawing of an automatic rifle. \n\nAt the meeting, a visibly exasperated Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lastoria said: 'It is not a preparation for martial law.' \n\n'Some people really, truly want to make this something it's not. \n\n'All we want to do is make sure our guys are trained for combat overseas.'", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
