There is no change for westbound traffic. \n\nThe two inside lanes will also remain closed while a central median and pedestrian refuge is built. \n\nFor the latest traffic information, visit http://www.livetraffic.com, download Live Traffic App or call the Transport Management Centre on 132 701. \n\nReal Estate Real Estate Real Estate", "source": "The Daily Examiner"}
