Serious side effects and death have been reported from such misuse.\n\nSECUREL is Relmada's proprietary abuse deterrent extended release technology for opioid drugs. SECUREL dosage forms cannot be easily crushed for inhalation or to obtain rapid euphoria from high blood levels when swallowed. It is also exceedingly difficult for I.V. abusers to extract the active drug from the dosage form using common solvents, including alcohol. \n\nAbout LevoCap ER\n\nLevoCap ER is an extended release, abuse resistant form of levorphanol, which is pharmacologically differentiated from morphine, oxycodone, and other strong opioids. LevoCap ER is being developed for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment. In particular, levorphanol binds to all three opioid receptor subtypes involved in analgesia (mu 1, kappa and delta), the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the norepinephrine and serotonin uptake sites, whereas morphine is relatively selective for mu sites. Due to these multiple activites, levorphanol could achieve analgesia in patients resistant to other strong opioids. About Relmada Therapeutics, Inc.
