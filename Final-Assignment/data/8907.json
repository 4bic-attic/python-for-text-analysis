Bruce Rauner to a key state labor board. \nA month to the day after he was licensed to practice law in Illinois, the younger Coli got a big break. \n\nIn the latest in a series of dealings involving the\u00a0Teamsters that have enriched his clout-heavy family, the union run by his brother and father hired the law firm he'd just opened as the \"exclusive provider\" of legal help to its 9,000-plus members. \n\nThe firm that the then-28-year-old, newly minted attorney's Illinois Advocates LLC was brought in to replace in December 2012 had made as much as $1 million a year for its work for the union only once. \u2026", "source": "HighBeam Research"}
