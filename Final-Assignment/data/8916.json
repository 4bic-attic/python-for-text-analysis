Maybe you were listening to \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore. Maybe you just filmed a Harlem Shake video with your friends. Whatever you did, it feels like ages ago. It was also the last time, prior to Monday, that New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia had a scoreless start. Sabathia shut down the Tampa Bay Rays offense for 6 2/3 innings, striking out six. Last time CC Sabathia made a start without an earned run: April 7, 2013 Of course, Sabathia was out for much of 2014 with a knee injury, but he had started 63 games in between scoreless starts. The Yankees lefty is 4-9 on the season with a 4.93 ERA.", "source": "FOXSports.com"}
