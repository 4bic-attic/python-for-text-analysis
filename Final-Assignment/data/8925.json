We made every effort to reach out to Congress leadership, but it was in vain,\u201d the minister added. \n\nThe government decision came after Congress working committee (CWC) led by Sonia Gandhi decided on Tuesday to stick to its demand for resignation of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje and external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. Congress also made it clear that it would not budge on three key demands for amendment to the GST bill. \n\nEarlier, finance minister Arun Jaitley said, \u201cKeeping political reality in mind, at the CCPA meeting it was decided to recommend to the President to prorogue the monsoon session\u201d. \n\nCalling for political statesmanship on the part of parties for tax reforms, Jaitley attacked Congress saying it was trying to punish the people for voting them out in last general elections. He also criticised Congress for its \u201cobstructionist\u201d attitude. All other opposition parties were in favour of passing the tax reform legislation, he added. \n\n\u201cIt is, however, clear now that they will continue with the same attitude. Congress\u2019s anger seems to be both with the government and the people of India. Their attitude is almost guided by a revenge against the people who have reduced them to 44 (in Lok Sabha),\u201d Jaitley said. \n\nAsked if the government reached out to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Jaitley said, \u201cWe discussed it with their leaders in Parliament and some of their leaders in Parliament are accessible.\u201d \n\nMonsoon session of Parliament that was held between July 21 and August 13 was a near washout, with an unrelenting Congress stalling a number of legislations, including GST bill. \n\nbadarinath@mydigitalfc.com", "source": "Financial Chronicle"}
