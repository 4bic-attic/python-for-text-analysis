They were definitely a bit nervous given my high price but I'm going to stay focused on proving my worth.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nAn interview with Martial's compatriot and new United team-mate Morgan Schneiderlin circulated on deadline day as the midfielder revealed he had to tell Rooney who Martial was. \n\nBut that has not phased the player - who instead is looking forward to working alongside the England captain. \n\n\"It is normal that Wayne Rooney doesn't know me,\" he added. \n\n\"I have played a lot in Ligue 1 but I'm happy to go there, he is a big player and next to him I will improve my game a lot.\" \n\nWhile Martial's arrival was one of the biggest deals of the transfer window, Real Madrid's failure to sign United goalkeeper David De Gea remains the major talking point. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nDe Gea's move to the Spanish capital was called off on Monday with United and Madrid blaming each other for the collapse of the deal. \n\nMadrid fired the first shot, issuing a statement on Tuesday afternoon which claimed delays at United's end had scuppered a deal worth \u00a329million which would have also seen Keylor Navas head to Old Trafford. \n\nUnited then hit back, claiming it was Madrid's fault the deal collapsed after they missed the deadline to register the deal with FIFA's Transfer Matching System (TMS). \n\nSpain international De Gea has yet to play for United this season as Van Gaal said he was not in the right frame of mind during the ongoing links to Madrid. \n\nNew signing Sergio Romero has instead been an ever-present although now De Gea will be at the club until at least January, team-mate Juan Mata has backed his fellow countryman to act professionally. \n\n\"He seems the same as ever to me, calm and relaxed,\" said Mata ahead of Spain's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovakia. \n\n\"It's been a manic few days for him, he's my friend and I'm there for him for whatever he needs. Right now he's focused on the two upcoming games for the national team; being here will do him good and he's going to be as professional as he has been throughout his career. \n\n\"His personality will help him. He manages to play even better in moments of maximum pressure and stress. His personality will help him on and off the pitch. \n\n\"His hunger and professionalism are intact. We all know what a great goalkeeper he is and he would make any team in the world better. The fans will get behind him and so will the team.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright PA Sport 2015, All Rights Reserved", "source": "Peterborough Evening Telegraph"}
