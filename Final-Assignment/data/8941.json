Scott Walker and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett stood with police officers and firefighters at the Milwaukee County War Memorial Friday morning. \n\nEd Panelli was also in attendance. His brother-in-law, Lt. William McGinn, was a firefighter who rushed into one of the World Trade Center towers moments before it collapsed. \n\n\"Tens of thousands of people are alive because of the sacrifices of the 400 and the other first responders that were able to get out alive,\" he said. \n\nOne of the most symbolic pieces at the ceremony is an actual piece from the World Trade Center towers. The steel beam is housed at the War Memorial because two Milwaukee men wanted people to be able to see and touch a piece of history. \n\n\"To actually bring a piece of the tragic day, showing the shape that it's in, so that we do not forget,\" said War Memorial Board member Joe Campbell. \"Do everything we can to prevent that from happening in the future.\" \n\nThe Trade Center beam was brought to Milwaukee in 2011. \n\n\nPanelli said that even though 14 years have passed, his connection to the horrific moments of that day remain strong. \n\n\n\"It's easier every year, but you never forget,\" Panelli said.", "source": "WISN Milwaukee"}
