It claimed 2,900 structures and 25 lives while burning 1,600 acres, according to Cal Fire. \n \nThe specific point of origin and cause of the Valley Fire is under investigation, Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynette Round said.\u00a0 \n \nCal Fire officials said the blaze started around 1:25 p.m. Saturday off High Valley Road near Bottle Rock Road in Cobb. The fire was at 70,200 acres and 35 percent contained as of Wednesday evening. \n \nAt least 585 homes and hundreds of other structures have been destroyed, Cal Fire officials said. \n \nThe fire claimed the life of a 72-year-old Lake County woman in her Anderson Springs home in Cobb. Several other Lake County residents have been reported missing. \n \nFour firefighters were injured in the fire Saturday and are in a Sacramento hospital. \n \nCal Fire officials said today that 14,000 firefighters are battling 10 large fires across California, and that this year's fire season has been a record-setting year regarding the number of fires, their size and \nthe destruction they've caused. \n \nPublished 6 minutes ago \n \r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n    \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n      \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t      \tCopyright Bay City News", "source": "NBC Los Angeles"}
