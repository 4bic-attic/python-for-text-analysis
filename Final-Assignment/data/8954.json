A ceasefire last month lasted only 48 hours. \n\nStumbling blocks have included the withdrawal of all rebels from Zabadani, safe passage for civilians seeking to leave Fuaa and Kafraya, and food and medical aid for those who stay on.\u00a0 \n\nElsewhere in Syria, at least five children were among 14 people killed by rebel fire on a government-held area of the northern city of Aleppo, the observatory and state media reported.", "source": "Jordan Times"}
