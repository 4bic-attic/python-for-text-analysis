I think it could be very interesting to read about the celebrities ( public figures were mentioned as well), but the problem is \u2013 what kind of the people should read that? \n \nIt is different for an engineer and an artist to read about the famous public personalities and to get equally inspired by their success stories. \n \nThere is also another thing to reconsider. It is all about having some luck. They talk about the talent, work and struggle \u2013 but when they are asked what and how \u2013 the only thing that comes out is that they were themselves. \u201cJust be you!\u201d\u00a0 \n \nFamiliar? Yes, well, an engineer can\u2019t be \u2018just himself\u2019, he has to put some real muscle into his work. \n \nSuccessful people made their biographies while being successful, not being unsuccessful.\u00a0 \n \nI want to see a bio from a terrifyingly unsuccessful person who is taking it as a champ. Because most of us are not celebrities, and we can only be inspired by the struggles of the ordinary people, not a billionaire. \n \nAlso I want to see that person being rock solid normal and proud of own failure. Then, and only then I will lift up one of those biographies and sincerely take in the consideration, from the bottom of my hearth, to take their struggles seriously.\u00a0 \n \nWhy? Because most of these celebrity bios, if not all, are ghostwritten.\u00a0", "source": "Socyberty"}
