The success of the BSL (Scotland) Bill is a wonderful achievement. \n \n\u201cI am proud, as a Scottish person, to see my country leading the way in making the first ever BSL Act in the UK.\u201d \n \nDelia Henry, director of Action on Hearing Loss Scotland, said:  \u201d We congratulate Mark Griffin MSP on the passing of his Bill and we hope the legislation will start to remove the communication barriers which affect the everyday lives of people who are deaf in Scotland and ensure that vital services become fully accessible for BSL users.\u201d \n \nThe post appeared first on Press and Journal .", "source": "Press and Journal"}
