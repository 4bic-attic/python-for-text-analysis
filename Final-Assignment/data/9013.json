People need to understand how much they should save now to have the income they need for the future and government needs to look at how they can help people achieve this. \n \n\u201cBut there are things government can do to make the current pensions tax relief system fairer. At the moment it is working against many people meaning they are missing out on valuable government contributions which they would otherwise get if they had a different employment status or were paid more. \n \n\u201cEnhanced Government pension contributions throughout people\u2019s working lives would reduce the need for top-ups when they come to retirement.\u201d \n   Notes to editors   \nOut of the \u00a327 billion spent by the government on tax relief for pension contributions, just \u00a3600m goes to the self-employed.
