Nobody,\u201d Cheek said, adding that there is a need to maintain a balanced budget.\n\nTaxes are always a contentious point. The City Council just approved a slight increase in property taxes earlier this month, though two more public hearings are scheduled for October before the change takes effect.\n\nBrooks said she supports the council\u2019s 4-2 vote to slightly raise taxes to help pay off debt on the city jail.\n\n\u201cI like it that we take a conservative approach,\u201d she added.\n\nThompson said transparency is the key for government to ensure trust with its citizens, and that extends most importantly to taxes.\n\nTurner said educating the public about where every penny is spent also helps instill trust.\n\nSmith said she wanted to remove the burden of local taxes on financially vulnerable groups.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it should be a burden on the elderly and veterans,\u201d she added. \n\nWhile no one likes taxes, Betancourt said he believed it\u2019s important to maintain service levels.\n\nVoting\n\nWhile the city school board and Hall County Board of Commissioners are elected by district, City Council members are elected \u201cat-large,\u201d meaning every voter, regardless of where they live, casts ballots in all races.\n\nProponents of district voting, however, believe it is more equitable and will ensure that minority candidates are elected to the City Council because only voters in a particular geographic area would be allowed to select a candidate from their ward to represent them.\n\nSome candidates shied away from the debate that has become contentious in recent months, and others left nothing uncertain.\n\n\u201cI think we should ask the voters,\u201d Betancourt said, adding that a voter referendum is the best way to decide the debate.\n\nSmith said she supports citywide voting. And Cheek said she recognized that if other local agencies and governments can implement district voting, so too can the City Council. \n\nTurner said he is more concerned about improving voter turnout than changing the way elections are held.\n\nBrooks said she will work in either system, though she appreciates that residents can have access to all councilmembers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open-minded,\u201d she added.\n\nFinally, Thompson said a day is coming when the change will be made, but that day has not yet come.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the city is ready,\u201d for district voting, he added. \n\nOpening and Closing\n\nIn opening and closing remarks, candidates made their appeals to the audience.\n\nThompson made the case that he can be the face of a new generation of leaders.\n\nAs a small business owner, \u201cI am entrenched\u201d in the community, he said.\n\nTurner said he has no other obligations if elected, and will serve as if it\u2019s a full-time job.\n\n\u201cMy heart and all my time will be devoted to the citizens of Gainesville.\u201d\n\nBetancourt said he believes the city has progressed a great deal in recent years, but he urged residents to find common ground rather than exploiting differences.\n\n\u201cI came here under the promise that this is a great city,\u201d he added.\n\nBrooks said she has no agenda other than to serve the interests of residents citywide.\n\nCheek said she is committed to being prepared and educating herself about all the issues residents face, and that while she has \u201cbig shoes to fill \u2026 I am up for the challenge\u201d\n\nAnd Smith called on \u201cwe the people\u201d as her mantra for governing.\n\n\u201cI just want to do what I can to serve the people of this great city,\u201d she said. \n\nCandidates speak\n\nZack Thompson\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to listen to its citizens.\u201d\n\nEmory Turner\n\n\u201cMy heart and all my time will be devoted to the citizens of Gainesville.\u201d\n\nLemuel Betancourt\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no community if we don\u2019t have something in common.\u201d\n\nBarbara Brooks\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready. I am not going to sit still. I\u2019m a mover.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e8 Cheek\n\n\u201cIf somebody were to ask me why you do it? It\u2019s just in me. I look forward to the work ahead.\u201d\n\nMontine Whelchel Smith\n\n\u201cWe the people need the City Council to help us see what we need.\u201d", "source": "Gainesville Times"}
