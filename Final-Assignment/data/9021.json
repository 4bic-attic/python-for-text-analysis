On Wednesday, that includes the main auditorium inside the Guglielmino Athletics Complex, where Russell held court before a throng of reporters. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for us, because a lot of people are doubting us,\u201d Russell says of Saturday\u2019s match up with No. 14 Georgia Tech, spraying words at a breakneck pace. \u201cAfter a game like Virginia where people thought we should have blown them out or played better than we played as a unit, people are starting to doubt us now. That\u2019s fun for us. \n \n\u201cFor me, it reminds me of that 2012 year. People were doubting us against Oklahoma, then we went out and beat Oklahoma. People were doubting us against Michigan State and we went out and beat Michigan State. From my perspective, I love these games, because it goes to show how we\u2019re going to play against a really tough opponent \u2014 an opponent that\u2019s virtually as good as we are. \n\n\u201cOf course I think we\u2019re better, but if you look on paper, they\u2019re a great team. They\u2019re a great team. It\u2019s a test for us to see who we really are early this year.\u201d \n\nWhat Russell wants to be, against an option offense as lethal as Georgia Tech\u2019s, is invisible \u2014 at least, to fans. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s run, run, run, run, then one deep ball,\u201d Russell says. \u201cAnd if that ball is caught, they just notice that. They don\u2019t notice the five-yard gain or the six-yard gain. Nobody cares about that. It\u2019s that 40-yard ball that they caught on you because you\u2019re looking in the backfield.\u201d \n\nA week ago, Russell fell victim to the latter, as the senior defensive back was caught gazing into the backfield on a Virginia hand off, allowing wide receiver Keeon Johnson to run by him for a 42-yard reverse pass touchdown. \n\nDo that again on Saturday, and the run-heavy Yellow Jackets will make an unexpected strike. \n\n\u201cEye violations and not paying attention to your job and responsibility will get you into the same kind of problems (against the triple option offense),\u201d head coach Brian Kelly said. \u201cSo you have to be extremely disciplined. You have to be locked into your responsibilities, and that\u2019s where if there is a carryover, that has to get better. \n\n\u201cThat certainly has to be something that we get better at in the back end of our defense.\u201d \n\nCertainly, Georgia Tech quarterback Justin Thomas isn\u2019t a threat to complete 26 passes and throw for 289 yards, as Virginia\u2019s Matt Johns did last week. But on Saturday, Russell and Co. must guard against the outlier \u2014 the occasional 40-yard pass that punctures a defense and catches the secondary off guard. \n \nFor a born playmaker, the challenge is to do your job. \n\nJust your job. \n\n\u201cIf you follow your man all day and be disciplined all day, it can be an easy game for you,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey throw the ball and you\u2019re on the route. If they run the ball, you\u2019re still on your man. \n\n\u201cIt can get boring. It really can get boring. But my job isn\u2019t to try to stop the dive. My job is anything that gets outside, come down and make a tackle. Or the PAP (play action pass), I have to get ready for that. But I\u2019m not trying to make a play in the backfield on a dive. I\u2019ve got Sheldon Day, Jaylon Smith. That\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do against a team like this. It\u2019s one of those things where you have to understand your role.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, Russell\u2019s role is to go unnoticed \u2014 to cover the receivers he\u2019s supposed to cover, make the tackles he\u2019s supposed to make and ensure that a busted coverage doesn\u2019t haunt him yet again. \n\nBut luckily for reporters, it isn\u2019t Saturday yet. \n\n\u201cNothing against Georgia Tech,\u201d Russell says with a grin, \u201cbut they haven\u2019t played anybody like Notre Dame yet as well.\u201d", "source": "Martinsville Reporter-Times"}
