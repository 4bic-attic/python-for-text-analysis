You know, the one that almost got the show cancelled earlier this year.  \nThe August 31 season premiere of Fashion Police was full of so many\u00a0controversial jokes. First, they fueled Taylor Swift and Katy Perry feud by suggesting the \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d singer probably wants to see Katy\u2019s \u201chead in a box.\u201d Then, guest co-host Maragaret Cho brought up  Giuliana Rancic \u2018s controversial joke about Zendaya \u2018s Oscars hair, while taking a jab at Miley Cyrus \u2018\u00a0VMAs dreads. \n Take Our Poll  \nIn the last five minutes of the season premiere, Margaret started criticizing Miley Cyrus\u2019 VMAs red carpet look. First, she said, \u201cIt looks like she got in a fight with duct tape and a chandelier. And the bitch won.\u201d And then when the topic of Miley\u2019s hair came up, Margaret said, \u201cThat hair looks like it smells like weed and patchouli oil.\u201d Clearly, she was referencing the whole Zendaya controversy. If you\u2019ll recall, Giuliana was blasted for being racist in early 2015 when she said\u00a0Zendaya\u2019s dreads at the Oscars likely smelled like weed. It caused a big controversy and co-host  Kelly Osbourne left the show because of it. So when Margaret Cho made the joke during the Aug. 31 episode, Giuliana just buried her face in a pillow out of embarrassment. Or she just didn\u2019t want to be caught laughing. \n \nWhether or not you found the joke to be awkward, fans seemed to love\u00a0it.
