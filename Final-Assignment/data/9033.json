Empliciti was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which according to the FDA, is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also recently validated for review the Marketing Authorization Application for Empliciti, granting it accelerated assessment. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nBristol-Myers Squibb has proposed the name Empliciti which, if approved by health authorities, will serve as the brand name for elotuzumab. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n\u201cBristol-Myers Squibb is delighted by the approach both agencies have taken to review the Empliciti applications as it underscores the unmet medical need in the treatment of multiple myeloma and the role Immuno-Oncology may play,\u201d said Michael Giordano, M.D., senior vice president, Head of Oncology Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. \u201cThe acceptance of our applications by the FDA and EMA brings Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Immuno-Oncology science a step closer to helping patients with hematologic malignancies.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nThe filing acceptance is primarily supported by data from the ELOQUENT-2 trial, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study, which evaluated Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. The results of this trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine on June 2. Additionally, the filing was supported by data from study CA204-009, a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study which evaluated Empliciti with bortezomib and dexamethasone versus bortezomib and dexamethasone alone. These Phase 2 results were presented in an oral session (Abstract #S103) at the 20 th Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA). \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n\u201cAbbVie is encouraged by the FDA\u2019s decision to award priority review to this application,\u201d said Gary Gordon, M.D., vice president, oncology clinical development, AbbVie. \u201cAbbVie is committed to the development of novel treatment options for people affected by cancer.\u201d \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n About Empliciti  \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nBristol-Myers Squibb has proposed the name Empliciti which, if approved by health authorities, will serve as the brand name for elotuzumab. Elotuzumab is an investigational immunostimulatory antibody targeted against SLAMF7, a cell-surface glycoprotein that is highly and uniformly expressed on myeloma cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells, but is not detected on normal solid tissues or on hematopoietic stem cells. The safety and efficacy of elotuzumab have not been evaluated by the FDA or any other health authority. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nBristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie are co-developing elotuzumab, with Bristol-Myers Squibb solely responsible for commercial activities. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n About Multiple Myeloma  \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nMultiple myeloma is a hematologic, or blood, cancer that develops in the bone marrow. It occurs when a plasma cell, a type of cell in the soft center of bone marrow, becomes cancerous and multiplies uncontrollably. Despite advances in multiple myeloma treatment over the last decade, it remains a largely incurable disease with only 45% of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. A common characteristic for many patients is that they experience a cycle of remission and relapse, in which they stop treatment for a short time, but eventually return to a treatment shortly after. Following relapse, less than 20% of patients are alive after five years. It is estimated that annually more than 114,200 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed globally and annually more than 79,000 people die from the disease globally. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n Immuno-Oncology at Bristol-Myers Squibb  \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nSurgery, radiation, cytotoxic or targeted therapies have represented the mainstay of cancer treatment over the last several decades, but long-term survival and a positive quality of life have remained elusive for many patients with advanced disease. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nTo address this unmet medical need, Bristol-Myers Squibb is leading research in an innovative field of cancer research and treatment known as Immuno-Oncology, which involves agents whose primary mechanism is to work directly with the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. The company is exploring a variety of compounds and immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with different types of cancer, including researching the potential of combining Immuno-Oncology agents that target different pathways in the treatment of cancer. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nBristol-Myers Squibb is committed to advancing the science of Immuno-Oncology, with the goal of changing survival expectations and the way patients live with cancer. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \n Oncology at AbbVie  \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nAbbVie's oncology research is focused on the discovery and development of targeted therapies that work against the processes cancers need to survive. By investing in new technologies and approaches, AbbVie is breaking ground in some of the most widespread and difficult-to-treat cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. AbbVie's oncology pipeline includes multiple new molecules in clinical trials being studied in more than 15 different cancers and tumor types.
