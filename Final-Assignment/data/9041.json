It\u2019s job done and now we need to think about the next match,\u201d Iniesta told Television Espanola. \n\n\u201cWe played quite a complete game. It is not easy to attack all the time and they had a few dangerous counter-attacks, but I think the fans enjoyed the team\u2019s performance and that is important.\u201d \n\nSpain coach Vicente del Bosque was also relieved to be back on top of the group, but believes his side once again failed to score the goals their dominance deserved. \n\n\u201cThey were three very important points and they clear up the route to the Euros. Now we need to go and win in Macedonia on Tuesday,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe played well both in defence and attack. Possibly, though, we created too few chances for the control and good play we showed.\u201d \n\nSlovakia were the only side in international football to have won all of their previous nine matches and nearly got off to a dream start as Robert Mak pounced on an error from Sergio Ramos, but pulled his shot wide of the far post. \n\nHowever, within a minute Spain were in front as Silva\u2019s inviting cross left Slovakia \u2018keeper Matus Kozacik in no man\u2019s land and Alba headed home. \n\nSpain were enjoying the vast majority of possession, but didn\u2019t create another clear-cut opportunity until Kozacik was harshly adjudged to have brought down Diego Costa as he burst clear on goal and Iniesta converted from the spot. \n\nIker Casillas had been preferred in goal to David de Gea once more with the latter yet to play a minute of competitive action this season with Manchester United, and he was forced into action by Marek Hamsik with a low drive just before the break. \n\nCasillas made another fine stop at the start of the second half to prevent Michal Duris bringing the visitors back into the game. \n\nSilva passed up a host of chances to seal a fine individual display with a goal as Tomas Hubocan made an excellent defensive block before the Manchester City playmaker failed to turn Costa\u2019s acrobatic overhead kick on target from point-blank range. \n\nPaco Alcacer replaced Costa with 15 minutes to go as the Chelsea man\u2019s frustration in front of goal in a Spain shirt continued. \n\nAnd Alcacer made an instant impact as he teed up Silva, but again he failed to convert when one-on-one with Kozacik. \n\nBoth sides are in action again on Tuesday as Spain travel to Macedonia, while Slovakia can seal their place in France with victory at home to Ukraine.", "source": "Gulf News"}
