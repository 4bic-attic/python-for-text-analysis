It doesn\u2019t take anything out of him training each day and he takes that into every game. \n \n\u201cPhysically, he\u2019s always in good shape. He can count himself lucky that he\u2019s never been injured in that time but because of his fitness levels, he does all the right things to give himself every chance of playing.\u00a0It\u2019s a great achievement for him. He\u2019s been a great signing for us. \n  \n\u201cI remember him as a young kid coming over to Sunderland and I soon liked the look of him.\u00a0He\u2019s always wanted to learn and I have to say, over the years I\u2019ve managed him, he\u2019s been a delight,\u2019 he concluded. \n  \nThe right-sided defender has only missed two games out of 126 since joining Hull City on loan from Sunderland in August 2012, and later making it a permanent deal in June 2013 for \u00a32 million. \n \nElmohamady has recently been the subject of interest of clubs such as Leicester and Swansea , following his side\u2019s relegation from the Premier League at the end of last season. \n  \nThe post Steve Bruce: Elmohamady has been a delight for us appeared first on King Fut .", "source": "King Fut"}
