There was a unifying spirit and in some cases, aesthetic amongst them that in my mind felt like a movement. I wrote this piece about New York\u2019s New Breed that emerged this season for AnOther Magazine online : \n \nNew York is earning the right to call itself new again. Whether it\u2019s the shift in fashion week venues from uptown to downtown, a renewed appetite for fresh energy or a growing apathy\u00a0towards the Big Apple\u2019s penchant for polished designers, a wind of change has blown and now a particular spate of designers have appeared, their voices resonating with a community disaffected with mainstream fashion. These designers are showing in low key, off-schedule shows dotted around the city, presenting\u00a0an emotional connection rather than parading a perfect product: the antithesis to the\u00a0hordes\u00a0of commercially-minded brands in New York\u2019s fashion establishment. Although this emerging group may have differing aesthetics to one another, they have one solid, common ground: the ability to reflect a tangible reality in their work, created through intuition rather than technical precision. It\u2019s relatable and engaging and here, we explore this idiosycratic new breed of New York designers and why they\u2019re challenging conventions in this make-or-break city. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEckhaus Latta backstage photography by Rebekah Campbell for Dazed Digital \n \nDissent, Disenchantment, Disenfranchisement \n When, a few years ago, Shayne Oliver broke\u00a0into the industry with\u00a0 Hood By Air , his cut-up and raw-edged attire felt like an act of protest, worn by models who viciously vogued and stomped down the runway. Since Oliver\u2019s ascent towards the fashion establishment, a young trail of labels has sprung in his wake and his previously underground contemporaries\u00a0have also come\u00a0to the fore. Akeem Smith, the longtime stylist of Hood By Air (who also styled the VFiles and Yeezy shows this season) explains that Oliver\u00a0\u201cset the tone that a young person, working with their peers post-recession, can do their own thing.\u201d HBA shows created a forum, anchored by specific casting and performances, where\u00a0we\u00a0are confronted with issues of inequality in race and sexuality \u2013 both in fashion and the world at large. It\u2019s a dialogue that has been building up through\u00a0the power of social media and online commentary, and it\u2019s up to the new and the brave to take on this mantle. \n \n\n \nMoses Gauntlett Cheng at VFiles backstage photography by Evan Schreiber \n \nThis week, shows by newcomers Vejas, Vaquera, Shan Huq and Moses Gauntlett Cheng could certainly be interpreted as outlets for the disenfranchised, but they are projecting much gentler rallying calls to their audience. According to Smith, discontent with the dominance of celebrity culture\u00a0and the lack of diverse representation across the entire media landscape are but two reasons why we have seen so many young designers spring up. \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves, or what we aspire to, on TV. All the shows that showed pieces of subcultures are gone. I think these young designers just want to see the characters they present\u00a0on their runways visible in the mainstream media; not just to put their cute top or dress on some celebrity.\u201d \n \nThe young New York-based trio Moses Gauntlett Cheng \u2013 comprising of David Moses, Esther Gauntlett and Sandy Cheng \u2013 showed their S/S16 collection as part of the group VFiles show. Inspired by\u00a0an Italian view of New Yorkers, they describe their work as \u201ca\u00a0response to our city, our families, our stresses and desires.\u201d \u00a0One of those stresses is obviously financial\u00a0\u2013\u00a0especially in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities.\u00a0 \u201cThe only thing that daunts me is money \u2013 that\u2019s my biggest stress,\u201d says Vejas Kruszewski , a self-taught designer, who showed his second collection in New York this week but still lives in Toronto to ease production and living costs. By knowing what financial hardship is, Kruszewski can design clothes to truly reflect this reality. \u201cPeople feel protected in my clothes. It\u2019s just so hard to exist here, so it\u2019s about making do with what I have.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \nShan Huq photography by Thomas McCarty for Dazed Digital \n \nShan Huq , who is also self-taught, spoke out for the middle American teenagers locked into mundane suburbia. Everyday shirts and tees were embroidered with musings like, \u201cWhen I was a server at Applebee\u2019s, my boss and I had a thing.\u201d Over the soundtrack, a loud and brash advert from the chain restaurant Olive Garden could be heard. Huq seemed to be passing comment on American consumerism and the pecking order of a society which isn\u2019t always a meritocracy. \n \nBut the collections of these new designers don\u2019t necessarily have to be expressions of dissatisfaction; they\u2019re also about portraying an uplifting, utopian ideal. So often fashion is presented within an extravagant, fantastical cocoon far removed from everyday experiences \u2013 but these designers are questioning the non-material part of our lives. How can clothes enrich our existence, as opposed to simply adorning it? Kruszewski\u2019s S/S16 collection had his comforting clothes set in an Edenic retreat, where motherhood and fertility were celebrated. A baby crawled around the presentation, skirting streetcast models in toggled ruched dresses, MA1 bomber skirts aand utilitarian white tank tops. Whether it\u2019s reaction, or dissension, or both, what these designers have in common is the genuine desire to reflect their surroundings and give their work a social context that an audience can connect with. \n \n\n \nChromat backstage photography by Paolo Musa for Dazed Digital \n \nMore Than Clothes \n There\u2019s a loose common aesthetic that one\u00a0can feel across all of these designers \u2013 but its one that is hard to define because of the haphazard, homespun nature of the clothes themselves. Bi-coastal label Eckhaus Latta \u2013 perhaps the most established of this post-HBA wave \u2013 specialises in using deadstock textiles to create something oddly seductive. Key words for its\u00a0S/S16 show were \u201cspill\u201d and \u201clust\u201d \u2013 it\u00a0wanted to make things look a little like they\u2019re \u201ccrumbling around the edges,\u201d revel in making the unwanted look desirable. \u201cOur language is centred around not necessarily being polished,\u201d says Mike Eckhaus. \u201cWe like things that feel worn. We like things that feel distressed.\u201d These are clothes that aren\u2019t about showing off the most innovative fabrics, the most ornate embellishment or the most technically complex cutting. An overly polished garment is, after all, the result of an expensive formal design education that few can afford these days. The run-down textures, down-and-out silhouettes and utilitarian feeling offer something more special and unique. \u201cPeople would be buying into a nice piece of clothing,\u201d says Kruszewski of his potential customers. \u201dBut also something alternative to\u2026 everything else.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \nVejas backstage photography by Evan Schreiber \n \nAn Intimate\u00a0Community \n Going from one young designer\u2019s show to the next, familiar faces appear repeatedly as you begin to notice the same friends of the designers turning up to all of these shows. There were also designers supporting other designers \u2013 some even walking in their shows, like David Moses (of Moses Gauntlet Cheng) appearing on the runways of Vaquera and Eckhaus Latta. These tight circles are created by both physical and digital bonds. \u201cWe are all a part of some online community, built through mutual \u2018likes\u2019 and friends, and maybe even a bit of sexual attraction,\u201d explains\u00a0Smith. Ruth Gruca, showroom director of young designer incubator VFiles , cites New York\u2019s nightlife (club nights like Ghet20 Goth1c) as places where people meet and intertwine with people from other fields, bringing music, art, film and even food into the mix:\u00a0\u201cEverybody is entangled in different aspects of culture.\u00a0 Everybody parties together.\u00a0 To meet likeminded people, whether they\u2019re in your field or not, really helps.\u201d \n \n\n \nTelfar backstage photography by Evan Schreiber \n \nThis cross pollination of worlds was best seen at Eckhaus Latta \u2019s show where, once again, Dev Hynes created the lo-fi distorted soundtrack and artists like India Salvor Menuez, Juliana Huxtable and Claire Christerson\u00a0walking the show and painter Annabeth Marks involved in the creation of looks.\u00a0 They brought life to the clothes because they lead creatively enriched lives. This multi-displinary approach means designers can also be open minded about their modes of presentation as seen in projects such as Telfar Clemens\u2019 collaboration with tech entrepreneur CultureSport and their anime epic that will be debuting later in the year; or Chromat\u2019s tie-in with Intel to create a\u00a0fascinating stress-sensing bra that automatically cools you down depending on your body temperature.\u00a0 Likeminded, comradely and collaborative, these designers know that they\u2019re better in numbers than by themselves, as befits a world increasingly dominated by a sharing economy. But it\u2019s\u00a0still not quite the utopia that some of these collections might suggest; they still have to exist within an industry that is tough for even the best designers to navigate. \u201cIt\u2019s sink or swim here,\u201d says Gruca.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s harder, but really beautiful things come of that. I\u2019m excited for what will happen next.\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\n \nVaquera backstage photography by Dillon Sachs", "source": "Style Bubble"}
