The march is one of a series of events taking place this fall for the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks\u2019 famous civil rights bus ride. \n\n\u201cNow everybody can be together instead of separated,\u201d says Tatiana Rivera, who was one of hundreds of fourth and fifth grade students from Williams Magnet School who marched in honor of Rosa Parks. \n\nThe school, along with other agencies, is participating in a series of events throughout Topeka for the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks\u2019 civil rights bus ride. \n\nMarty Gies, Williams Magnet School principal says, \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard for them to even understand the concept, so that\u2019s why this is really important for them to understand that, in the past, this is what things were done and how we\u2019ve changed.\u201d \n\nLearning about the changes has helped them to understand. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m in school today,\u201d says Niccolas Manning, a fifth grader. \n\nAnd that it\u2019s okay to have all kinds of friends \n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have to just be friends with the same people all the time that we know, we can be friends with different people,\u201d says Manning. \n\nWhich is something all the students are proud to be able to do. \n\n\u201cNow everyone can be together and my classmates, I have all [differently] colored classmates and that\u2019s cool,\u201d says fifth-grader Ian Cusick. \n\nThis march has also helped student like Tamijha Nichols realize \u201cwe all can become friends and we can all make a change someday.\u201d \n\nSchool officials say students learning about their history isn\u2019t just going to be a week-long thing; it\u2019s something they plan on teaching the kids throughout the entire school year. Each quarter will be a different topic about all different types of heritage. \n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been to history class in a while, Rosa Parks became an American hero because she refused to give up her seat to move to the back of the bus in 1955, sparking the Civil Rights Movement. The next event in honor of Rosa Parks will be held on September 26, when a museum bus just like the one Parks rode in will be at Highland Park.", "source": "KSNT TV"}
