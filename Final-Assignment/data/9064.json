I congratulate every student who made the list and am especially proud of the Maryland HBCUs for helping to mold so many future leaders. The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities All-Stars is a prime example of why we need to continue to invest in and support these colleges and universities across the country.\u201d\nThe All-Stars were selected from more than 450 students who submitted applications that included a transcript, resume, essay and recommendation. Over the course of the year, the HBCU All-Stars will serve as ambassadors of the White House initiative by providing outreach and communications with their fellow students about the value of education and the role of the Initiative as a networking resource.\u00a0\u00a0Through social media and their relationships with community based organizations, the All-Stars will share promising and proven practices that support opportunities for all young people to fully achieve their educational and career potential.
