Kids, this one is fresh off the playground\u2026if there was a bar called the playground. Schoolyard fights escalate to bar fights when you\u2019re a famous musician. Apparently last night, The Black Keys\u2019 drummer Patrick Carney was just trying to sip on his gin and tonic when \u201c40-year-old bully\u201d Jack White tried to start a fight with him. \n \nCarney immediately took to Twitter to recount the story and throw in some digs at white, including the following: \n \nNot the best drummer but a passionate one. But any way Jack White. A 40 year old bully tried to fight the 35 year old nerd. \n\u2014 Patrick Carney (@patrickcarney) September 14, 2015 \n \nJack white is basically billy corgan\u2019s dumb ass zero t-shirt in human form. \n\u2014 Patrick Carney (@patrickcarney) September 14, 2015 \n \nDespite never having met White in the past, their beef goes back to 2013 when White accused The Black Keys of ripping off the White Stripes\u2019 sound. \n \nWhite released an official statement to Pitchfork this morning, saying, \u201cNobody tried to fight you, Patrick. Nobody touched you or \u2018bullied\u2019 you. You were asked a question you couldn\u2019t answer so you walked away. So quit whining to the Internet and speak face to face like a human being. End of story.\u201d \n \nTalked to jack for an hour he\u2019s cool. All good. \n\u2014 Patrick Carney (@patrickcarney) September 14, 2015 \n \n\n \nThe two dudes are apparently \u00a0trying to work it out, but we look forward to any future Instagram posts from Carney. \n     \n When you get cut from the cure. \n \nA photo posted by Patrick Carney (@officerpatrickcarney) on Sep 14, 2015 at 4:29am PDT", "source": "idobi Network"}
