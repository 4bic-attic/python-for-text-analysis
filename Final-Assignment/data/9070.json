Ellison\n\n\"The End Game,\" the third collaboration by Catherine Coulter and J.T. Ellison, is another outstanding entry in this series that features FBI agent Nicholas Drummond and his partner, Michaela Caine.\n\nA ruthless organization known as the Celebrants of the Earth (COE) has been bombing power grids and oil refineries. Up to this point, no one has been hurt. But that changes with an explosion at a New Jersey refinery. While Drummond and Caine are investigating, a secondary device goes off, almost killing them. A cyberattack on several oil companies causes even more havoc.\n\nMeanwhile, undercover CIA agent Vanessa Grace is trying to destroy COE from within. She's earned the trust of the leader of the group, but someone else has joined the party \u2014 a ruthless assassin wanted by several world governments. He has a bold plan to not only use COE to destroy the United States financially, but also to assassinate the president and vice president.\n\nThe pieces are moving rapidly toward the end game, and the FBI needs to work with other government agencies if it is going to stop the chaos.\n\nReaders who like romance with their suspense will especially enjoy this latest installment of Coulter and Ellison's stellar series. To add more fun to the reading, each chapter opens with a chess move from the match in 1956 between Bobby Fischer and Donald Byrne that was dubbed The Game of the Century. The pacing of the novel follows closely to the events of this historic event.\n\nLayer upon layer, \"The End Game\" is worth \"checking\" out.", "source": "Denver Post"}
