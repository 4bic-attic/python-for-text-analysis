The Hockinson defense that gave \u00adopponents nightmares last season is looking for a reoccurrence. And with eight starting seniors back, who\u2019s to say the defense that allowed 27 points in six league games won\u2019t be just as good? \u201cWe should be if not as good, maybe a little bit better,\u201d Hockinson coach Rick Steele said. That\u2019s a scary thought for the rest of the Class 2A Greater St. Helens League. The Hawks allowed just three points in its first six games last season. By the time they finished the regular season 9-0, opponents had been outscored 325-30. But that\u2019s not what Hockinson is drawing on to set its goals this season. Last year, the Hawks reached the state playoffs for the first time after rallying from a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit in the district playoffs. They won a 7-2 defensive slugfest in the state playoffs the following week. Hockinson begins this season ranked in the Associated Press statewide poll. \u201cEverybody has placed a target on us,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, but also a sign of respect. I\u2019d much rather have a target on us than be a team nobody worries about.\u201d Hockinson\u2019s defense runs an unusual 3-5 alignment that includes three linemen and five linebackers. If the linemen can hold their own physically, it allows more options for the linebackers to blitz and swarm to the football. But beyond that scheme, what sets Hockinson apart is its size. At 6-foot-3, 235 pounds, Cameron Loos is receiving Division-I attention as a tight end and linebacker. Steele said Loos can bench-press 335 pounds multiple times. In addition to being a starting linebacker, 6-foot-3, 205 pound Kedrick Johnson is Hockinson\u2019s top returning receiver. He had 18 catches for 286 yards and five touchdowns last season. After starting at quarterback as a sophomore, Mitch Lines is competing with sophomore Cannon Racanelli for the starting job. HOCKINSON HAWKS Coach: Rick Steele (11th season) 2014 season: 11-1, 6-0 in 2A GSHL. Key players: Will Ortner, sr., ol/dl; Steven Carlisle, sr., rb/lb; Kedrick Johnson, sr., wr/lb; Gage Seekins, sr., te/lb; Cameron Loos, sr., te/lb; Peter Schultz-Rathbun, sr., ol/lb; Jared Oja, sr., rb/db; Cole Walker, sr., wr/db Team notes: Remember last year\u2019s defense that allowed just 27 points in six league games? They\u2019re almost all back, including eight starting seniors. That has Hockinson the clear favorite to repeat as league champions. On offense, receiver Kedrick Johnson and tight end Cameron Loos have size that\u2019s tough to match up with. Schedule Sept. 4 at La Center, 7 p.m. Sept. 11 Prairie, 7 p.m. Sept. 18 Castle Rock, 8 p.m. Sept. 25 at Mark Morris*, 7 p.m. Oct. 2 Hudson\u2019s Bay*, 7 p.m. Oct. 9 at Ridgefield*, 7 p.m. Oct. 16 at Washougal*, 7 p.m. Oct. 23 Woodland*, 7 p.m. Oct. 30 R.A.

Key players: Tristan Maxwell, sr., rb/db; Stone Sabourin, sr., te/lb; Jared Bacon, jr., ol/de; Jordan Hickman, jr., qb; Sergio Vega, jr., ol/dl; Shaun Morgan, sr., rb/lb. Team notes: The Eagles are young and return only a handful of starters, but first-year coach Mark Oliverio likes his team\u2019s energy and attitude at practice. Junior Jordan Hickman takes over the offense after seeing action in six games last year as a backup. \u201cWe plan on being a team that can throw downfield,\u201d Hickman said. Schedule Sept. 4 at Fort Vancouver, 8 p.m. Sept. 11 Heritage, 5 p.m. Sept. 18 Woodland*, 5 p.m. Sept. 25 at La Center, 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at Hockinson*, 7 p.m. Oct. 9 at Washougal*, 7 p.m. Oct. 16 Mark Morris*, 8 p.m. Oct. 23 at R.A.

Key players: Will Burghardt, jr., qb/wr/db; Nigel Princehouse, sr., ol/dl; August Shulda, sr., rb/lb. Team notes: Not much went right last season for the Monarchs, who were shut out four times and allowed 35.1 points per game. This year, junior Will Burghardt moves from receiver to quarterback. Running back August Shulda won second-team all-league honors last year. The defense should be better with four starters back. Schedule Sept. 4 Kelso, 7 p.m. Sept. 11 at Columbia River, 7 p.m. Sept. 18 at R.A. Long*, 7 p.m. Sept. 25 Hockinson*, 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at Prairie, 7 p.m. Oct. 8 Woodland*, 7 p.m. Oct. 16 at Hudson\u2019s Bay*, 8 p.m. Oct. 23 at Ridgefield*, 7 p.m. Oct. 30 Washougal*, 7 p.m. *\u20142A GSHL game R.A. LONG LUMBERJACKS Coach: Erik Bertram (7th season) 2014 season: 6-4, 4-2 in 2A GSHL. Key players: Owen Bertram, sr., qb; Gunnar Blix, sr., rb/lb; Hunter Jones, sr., wr/db; Keoni Mawae, jr., ol/dl. Team notes: Last year, R.A. Long started 4-1 before quarterback Owen Bertram broke his collarbone. Now, a healthy Bertram and five other returning starters on offense look to vie for a playoff berth. Coaches are excited about senior Gunnar Blix, a 220-pound running back-linebacker who played last year at Wahkiakum. Schedule Sept. 3 Columbia River, 7 p.m. Sept. 11 at Kelso, 7 p.m. Sept. 18 Mark Morris*, 7 p.m. Sept. 25 at Washougal*, 7 p.m. Oct. 2 Ridgefield*, 7 p.m. Oct. 9 Prairie*, 7 p.m. Oct. 16 at Woodland*, 7 p.m. Oct. 23 Hudson\u2019s Bay*, 7 p.m. Oct. 30 at Hockinson*, 7 p.m. *\u20142A GSHL game RIDGEFIELD SPUDDERS Coach: Dan Andersen (4th season) 2014 season: 5-4, 2-4 in 2A GSHL. Key players: Logan Black, sr., ol/dl; Lane Andersen-, sr., ol/dl; Jesse Dobson, sr., ol/dl; Jack McGinley, sr., ol/dl; Cade Morrill, sr., qb/db; Tommy Herz, sr., rb/db; Nick Thomas, sr., wr/db. Team notes: It all starts in the trenches for the Spudders. Four seniors bring 11 combined years of starting experience. Three of those four were first-team all-league last season. That group went 0-9 as sophomores before improving to 5-4 last year. \u201cWe still have a chip on our shoulder from going 0-9,\u201d Jesse Dobson said. Schedule Sept. 4 Castle Rock, 7 p.m. Sept. 11 at Kalama, 7 p.m. Sept. 18 at Washougal*, 7 p.m. Sept. 25 at Woodland*, 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at R.A.

Key players: Tyler Bowlin, jr., qb; Dakota Payne, sr., wr/db; Doneald Hobert Jr., sr. wr/lb; Jacob Albert-Sonneman, jr., ol/dl; Dan Davis, wr/db Team notes: Replacing the graduated Brandon Casteel\u2019s 1,177 rushing yards and 15 TDs won\u2019t be easy, but coach David Hajek likes the athleticism he sees heading into the second season of his third stint at Washougal. Tyler Bowlin takes over as starting quarterback. He has a large target in 6-foot-1, 195 pound senior Doneald Hobert Jr. Schedule Sept. 4 Stevenson, 7 p.m. Sept. 11 at White Salmon, 7 p.m. Sept. 18 at Ridgefield, 7 p.m. Sept. 25 R.A.

Key players: Wyatt Harsh, so., qb; Jared Cloud, sr., te; Isaac Andersen, jr., ol/dl; Christian Mendez, sr., ol/dl; Hunter Raney, sr., wr/db; Tristan Thomas, jr., rb/lb; Tylar Bishop, sr., rb/db/k; Jeff Jackson, sr., ol/dl. Team notes: Last year, quarterback Wyatt Harsh won first-team all-league honors as a freshman. Now, Harsh will be expected to lead a team that lost several key seniors, including league MVP Eli Whitmire.\u00a0 But the entire starting offensive line is back led by junior Isaac Andersen, who was second-team all state last season.
