Because the choice will never be between a deeply unpopular Democrat and a popular or even mildly disliked\u00a0Republican. The choice will be between a deeply unpopular Democrat and a deeply unpopular Republican. The phrase \u201clesser of two evils\u201d will be applied, but the fact is that any Republican candidate will be vilified in the press over pointless things like traffic tickets or what religion they think President Barack Obama belongs to. Statements will be taken out of context in order to paint the Republican candidate as out-of-touch or egregiously unsympathetic. Even a candidate as unpopular as Hillary Clinton would likely be on Election Day 2016 has a smoother path to the presidency than any Republican. When Moody\u2019s Analytics presented its first 2016 prediction in early August, Republicans were thrilled. The financial risk management firm had predicted a razor-thin margin favoring Democrats with 270 electoral votes to Republican\u2019s 268. That gave Republicans a huge opportunity to win despite 2008 and 2012 demographics pointing to a new Democratic Majority. If Clinton continues down the path she\u2019s on, it wouldn\u2019t take many more email revelations to tip the scale in Republicans\u2019 favor. The fate of the 2016 election would fall on Virginia, according to Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi. The Moody\u2019s model predicted that Republicans would win the swing states of Colorado, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. Democrats only needed to win Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia (obviously in addition to all the solidly Blue states like California, Massachusetts and New York). If Clinton continues down the path she\u2019s on, it wouldn\u2019t take many more email revelations to tip the scale in Republicans\u2019 favor. Moody\u2019s analysis high was sadly short-lived. At the end of August, just 22 days after predicting a close election, Moody\u2019s Senior Economist Dan White posted an update to the forecast model predicting a landslide for Democrats. That 270-268 electoral margin widened to 326-212 in favor of Democrats. The updated prediction does rest on swing state votes within the margin of error, but it\u2019s still a huge change from the earlier forecast. The new model still provides Republicans with a path forward, but it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle. Call me a pessimist, but I don\u2019t see an easy path for the GOP. This is still Ms. Clinton\u2019s election to lose. Hillary Clinton could be close to indictment and still have a path to victory. (By the way I don\u2019t think she will be indicted.) Recall that Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. won re-election despite making no public appearances for several months before the election (due to his bipolar disorder and gastrointestinal issues) and was under a criminal investigation into his alleged misuse of public funds (charges were filed a few months after he won re-election). Former California State Senator Leland Yee \u2013 also a Democrat \u2013 received 9.8 percent of the vote in the election for his seat, despite him dropping out of the race due to charges of accepting bribes and conspiracy to traffic firearms. That put him in third place out of eight candidates, and the election was months after he was charged. Both Mr. Jackson and Mr. Yee\u2019s crimes were much sexier than Ms. Clinton\u2019s email scandal. Again, I don\u2019t think she will be indicted, and if she were it would severely hamper her election chances \u2013 but it would not completely discount her. Being under an FBI probe has so far not cratered her chances. Yes, her popularity is in freefall, but she\u2019s still the odds-on favorite to become the next president. Let\u2019s suppose Ms. Clinton were indicted (for the third time, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen). Assuming the indictment came months before the election, would Democrats find a new nominee, or would Ms. Clinton and her camp shrug it off as they have been doing for the better part of the year? It would be pretty hard to shrug off, but the relaxed attitude she and her team have taken toward the scandal thus far has provided an insight into their thinking on the issue. I\u2019m not convinced there is much that would stop Ms. Clinton from seeking the presidency in 2016 even a criminal investigation. And while I don\u2019t believe she has the same mainstream media support that Mr. Obama had in 2008, I do believe that she will have favorable coverage compared to that of the eventual Republican nominee \u2013 no matter what the status of her email scandal. The fact of the matter is that despite Fox having more viewers, it\u2019s mostly people who already vote Republican or are forced to watch in order to get article ideas. More middle viewers will turn to presumed unbiased networks like CNN or NBC and will be bombarded with a \u201cRepublicans are evil\u201d mantra. An incredibly disliked and distrusted Hillary will still be viewed as being better on issues like poverty and women\u2019s health than any Republican \u2013 even a Republican viewed as \u201chonest\u201d or \u201clikable.\u201d", "source": "Observer"}
