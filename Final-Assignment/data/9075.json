Vlasic chose to end her season after the World Championships to fully mend from the injuries that dogged her over the past two seasons.\n\nShubenkov meanwhile will headline the meeting's signature race, named to honor Croatia's inter-war hurdler Boris Hanzekovic. Shubenkov, who won in Zagreb last year, blasted to a 12.98 national record in Beijing to add the world title to the pair of European crowns he won in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe men's 110m hurdles traditionally boasts the meeting's strongest field. Unfortunately, injury in Zurich has forced perennial threat David Oliver and world leader Orlando Ortega to the sidelines, but Shubenkov will still have to fend off Frenchman Pascal Martinot-Lagarde and Jason Richardson of the United States to bag the largest trophy.", "source": "China.org.cn"}
