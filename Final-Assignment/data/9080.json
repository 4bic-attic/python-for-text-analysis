As Gibbs ( Mark Harmon ) recovers from the gunshot wound he suffered at the end of last season, his past will come back to haunt him - in more ways than one. While he drifts in and out of consciousness post-surgery (which will be performed by guest star Jon Cryer ), Gibbs once again begins having hallucinations involving Mike Franks ( Muse Watson ), his former colleague/mentor who was killed in Season 8. But, unlike his previous visions, these don't stop with Mike. \"You have to remember that Gibbs is in a difficult place,\" showrunner Gary Glasberg tells TVGuide.com . \"He's going to see some things and talk with some people that might surprise everybody. It's no surprise that Mike is there, but there are some other people from his past who he also interacts with, in some really touching scenes.\" Catch up on all this week's Mega Buzz And not all of the returning faces will be apparitions. Episode 2 finds an old friend bringing a case to Gibbs \"that sheds a bunch of light on Gibbs' past and things that we still don't know about,\" Glasberg teases. But - sorry, Cote de Pablo fans - there is one important figure from Gibbs' past who won't be returning, in any capacity. \"There'll definitely be some surprise appearances of people from our NCIS past, but Ziva David is not one of them,\" Glasberg says adamantly.
