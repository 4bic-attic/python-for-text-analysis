NW winds 9 knots. Plenty of S in the swell with clean conditions. Swell has picked up slightly since early this morning and most of the open beaches are offering a decent wave. Lower tide later in the morning should help out as well. \n\nMorning Shot: Herald photographer Darren Pateman captured a shot of rider Dave Bonsor at Glenrock this morning. IF TONY Abbott cares about jobs in Newcastle, he should put his money where his mouth is. \n\nCandlelight vigil for refugees: photos: NOVOCASTRIANS have gathered at sombre, candlelit vigils to remember drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi and urge the federal government to increase Australia\u2019s refugee intake. NELSON Bay Golf Club is expected to cancel all major events for the forseeable future but hope to have the course open for play next week.", "source": "Newcastle Herald"}
