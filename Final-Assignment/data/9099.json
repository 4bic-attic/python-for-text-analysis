While many people associate churches with grandiose architecture and awe-inspiring designs, not all chapels are quite so imposing. This contemporary church features a charming design that allows it to fit into the existing environment. \nThe Apostle Peter and St. Helen the Martyr Chapel is located in the city of Paphos, Cyprus. The tiny church features an unimposing design that is inspired by traditional Byzantine architecture. While the entrance to the chapel is large and welcoming, the roof slopes down on one side to allow the structure to blend into the existing environment. The result is a contemporary chapel that serves the needs of the local community. \n\nThe modern orthodox chapel demonstrates that contemporary church architecture deviates significantly from traditional designs.
