Morgan has turned research on millennials\u2019 money habits and turned it into a \u201creality script\u201d to explore how things could work out for them. \nTalk about drama. \n \nJ.P. Morgan has turned research on millennials\u2019 money habits \u2014 saving patterns, including for retirement, and such milestones as home buying \u2014 and turned it into a \u201creality script\u201d to provide a feel for how things could work out for the younger generation as they age their way toward retirement. \n \nThe research, \u201c \u2018The Millennials\u2019\u2014Now streaming: the millennial journey from saving to retirement, \u201d presents the dilemmas and problems facing millennials as they head toward that long sunset of life. \n  \nFirst there\u2019s college; while millennials, said the report, are \u201chighly educated but indebted,\u201d some are also at a \u201cglobal skills disadvantage,\u201d leaving them open to competition from international peers. \n \nSaid the report, \u201cU.S. millennials ranked 21st out of 22 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in numeracy; in literacy, half scored below the minimum proficiency level; and on problem-solving, 56 percent met minimum standards, ranking behind every other OECD nation they were compared with.\u201d \n \nOkay, so they\u2019re not likely to excel at work. \n \nIn addition, they\u2019re also more likely to pursue fields that don\u2019t pay as well as \u201cbusiness, health, and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\u201d \n \nInstead they\u2019ll be looking at social science, communications, criminal justice or library science. Scratch fat savings accounts \u2014 whether for short-term needs or for retirement. \n \nNot that they\u2019d be doing all that much investing in those\u00a0retirement accounts, anyway \u2014 the study found that some millennials prefer to use the mattress method, stashing their spare cash in, well, cash, while others distrust the market and won\u2019t be availing themselves of things like target-date funds. \n \nWill they marry? \n  \nOne out of four may never take the plunge, according to the research. \n \nCan they buy a home? \n \nMillennials are less likely to do so, given their generational handicaps of \u201clabor market pressures, slower real income growth, delayed household formation, the burden of student loan repayment and aftershocks from the financial crisis.\u201d \n \nSee, there\u2019s that\u00a0money factor again. \n \nAnd, in the soap opera of life, not only are millennials pretty much stuck with defined contribution rather than defined benefit plans, since the latter are getting as scarce as unicorns, they\u2019re also more likely to be haunted by \u201cjob and wage uncertainty,\u201d making saving for retirement a major problem. \n \nAdd to that the factor of a longer\u00a0life expectancy\u00a0and downward pressure on such safety nets as Social Security, and millennials are facing the ultimate plot twist: running out of money before the end of the show. \n \nThe report lays out worthy savings goals for millennials, but the likelihood of that particular show getting canceled is pretty high, so it looks as if the series won\u2019t have a happy ending\u2014unless somebody changes the script. \n \nSee also: \n \nHow annuities can help you sell to millennials \n \n5 things millennials want from benefits \u00a0 \n  \nOriginally published on BenefitsPro .
