U.S. hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, whose Third Point LLC holds a stake in Suzuki, has urged the Japanese company to cancel the shares that it repurchases. \n\nLoeb, after the arbitration court ruling on Aug. 30, also said Suzuki should focus on improving value for existing shareholders. \n\nSuzuki and Volkswagen agreed to tie up in December 2009, pledging to cooperate on technology and on expanding in emerging economies, but the alliance soon faltered. Suzuki filed for arbitration in November 2011. \n\n(Reporting by Chris Gallagher; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "source": "West Australian"}
