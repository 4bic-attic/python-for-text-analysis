I\u2019m sitting here at my desk wearing a sundress and sandals. It\u2019s Fall doesn\u2019t officially start for about three more weeks. This pumpkin spice mania has got to stop, people. Especially so early in the year. While we can get behind pumpkin spice lattes (and pumpkin spice ales) every now and again (and are glad to hear Starbucks will actually be using pumpkin in its recipe this year ), pumpkin just doesn\u2019t need to be an ingredient in every item we eat this fall. (We\u2019re glad to hear that that Pumpkin Spice Four Loko was all a hoax.) Here are some products we think go a bit too far: Pumpkin Spice Pop Rocks So a liberal dose of sugar with a sprinkling of nutmeg? (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.)

What would the consistency be like? So many questions. Then again, the reviews we read about it tend to be pretty positive. (Photo: Mike Mozart , Flickr.) Page 2 of 2 - Pumpkin Pie Peanut Butter Pumpkin spice? Delicious. Peanut butter? Doubly delicious. Together, in whipped form? Not so much. Leave our peanut butter alone, JIF.

Or do you prefer other fall flavors?", "source": "Wayne Independent"}
