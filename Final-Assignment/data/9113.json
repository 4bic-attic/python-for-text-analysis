For a number of days the circumstances around that event were unknown, causing a lot of fear in the community.\nIt later emerged that another member of the community had discharged a hunting rifle into the air, with the bullet traveling over a mile before striking the girl. He was later charged with reckless homicide.\nThe shooter in this latest instance remains unknown, and there are no witnesses who heard the shot.\nHunting is popular with the Amish. Guns are fairly common, both for hunting purposes and for eliminating pests on farms.\nAs noted above, Captain Hunter called the possibility this was a stray bullet a \u201cone in a million\u201d event. If that\u2019s the case, it would be the second such one in a million event in the past few years.\nGiven that, a couple of possibilities come to mind: it was intentional, or there continue to be some very careless hunting practices in the community\u2013even following Rachel Yoder\u2019s death.\nGet the Amish in your inbox\nRelated Articles to Ohio Amish Teen Hit In Head By Possible Stray Bullet\nReckless homicide charge in Ohio Amish shooting Fifteen-year-old Rachel Yoder was killed in Holmes County, Ohio last December when an Amish hunter fired his weapon into the air from over a mile away.
