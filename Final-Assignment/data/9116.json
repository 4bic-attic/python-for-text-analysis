There was enough surface area for breathing room, but attendance was far from sparse. \n \nThe students, many of them freshmen, were there for a rock concert. But in the back of their minds, they knew they were actually in front of Squires to begin the new semester. \n \nThe annual Welcome Back Kickoff Concert is exactly that. Held by Class Programs (and this year in conjunction with The Virginia Tech Union), the concert serves to usher in the fall semester and let new Hokies know that college life goes on after class has ended. \n \n(Full disclosure, I served on the Virginia Tech Union\u2019s Programming Council the past two years. I did not have any involvement with the inception or production of this concert.) \n \nFriday\u2019s concert doubled as a pep rally for the fast-approaching football season, and the event doubled as a spirit rally for next Monday\u2019s opener against Ohio State. \n \nThe Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Regimental Band, The Highty-Tighties, came out swinging with their meticulously rehearsed version of \u201cTech Triumph.\u201d Afterward, they went through some jazzier tunes\u00a0\u2014 those caught up on their 90s ska definitely noticed The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\u2019 \u201cThe Impression That I Get.\u201d \n \n[embedded content] \n \nThe band was closely followed by a performance from Dance Company at Virginia Tech and some rhythmic hip-gyrations from the Student Alumni Association Low Techs. \n \nWith that, the spirit rally concluded, the barriers went down and the mass of students flooded toward the stage. \n \nVirginia Tech alumnus DJ TMMPO took his place before the crowd to hype them up, asking if any of them hadn\u2019t been to a Hokie football game before. Just a few raised hands were enough to prompt Metallica\u2019s \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and a quick lesson in jumping for the freshmen. \n \n\u201cTMMPO is just great for Virginia Tech. He helps out a lot with SAA stuff, he does a lot with Ring Dance and Relay for Life,\u201d said Pat Finn, Class of 2017 President and junior marketing major. \u201cTMMPO is the real MVP in this situation.\u201d \n \nSome remixes and bass drops later (not to mention the help from TMMPO\u2019s handy dandy new fog cannon), DJ TMMPO made way for local favorite The Band Concord. \n \nFresh from their summer tour, the Blacksburg based, five-piece folk-rock outfit reminded everyone why they\u2019re so sought-after for local events. \n \nThe Band Concord hasn\u2019t missed a step with their musicianship. Their performance showed not only a great amount of technical experience with their instruments (fiddle, mandolin and upright bass, to name a few) but also months of comfort onstage. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nMost importantly, the crowd was into it. \n \n\u201cWe all know Alex (Winemiller, bassist for The Band Concord), and he did awesome \u2013 well, they all did awesome,\u201d said Wayne Stafford, a senior neuroscience and psychology double-major. \n \nFrom their first song, \u201cEtchings,\u201d to a new one called \u201cGambling Man,\u201d The Band Concord has their smooth sound down to a science \u2013 the four-part harmonies didn\u2019t hurt, either. \n \nThe band hasn\u2019t done much to hide its inspiration from groups like The Avett Brothers, but with the upcoming concert in Burruss Hall, they didn\u2019t have to. Concord was quick to respond with a cover of \u201cTalk on Indolence.\u201d \n \n[embedded content] \n \nThe Band Concord closed with a new song called \u201cRed Cars and Kitty Pryde\u201d (member and Tech alumnus Andrew Steger assured me it isn\u2019t about the \u201cX-Men\u201d character) and made way for the headlining act. The cloudy skies brought a few drops of rain, but it wasn\u2019t enough to derail the show. \n \nWithin seconds of their first song, Durham, North Carolina-based headliner Delta Rae made it clear why their fan base is so enthusiastic. \n \n\u201c(Delta Rae) is from my home state, so it\u2019s pretty awesome to see some talented artists from North Carolina,\u201d said Spencer Vass, a freshman in university studies. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m from Durham, so I know of them, but I\u2019ve never seen them before,\u201d said Maggie Caruso, a junior biology major. \u201cThey were really good.\u201d \n \nWhat the band lacks in eccentric instrumentation, it makes up for in talent and experience. Siblings Brittany, Ian and Eric H\u00f6lljes and Elizabeth Hopkins are all vocal powerhouses. That isn\u2019t to say bassist Grant Emerson and percussionist Mike McKee don\u2019t pull their own weight, but the singing definitely caught me off-guard. \n \nDelta Rae is clearly a band that wears its emotions on its sleeve. Guitarist and vocalist Ian H\u00f6lljes told me his thoughts about playing the first show of the school year. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re very honored. I think it seems like a very beautiful way to start off the year, and I have very fond memories of moments like this from my college career,\u201d H\u00f6lljes said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to have it come kind of full circle.\u201d \n \n[embedded content] \n \nThat same emotion permeates their songs, as well. From their upbeat breakup song \u201cIf I Loved You\u201d to the pounding \u201cDance in the Graveyards\u201d (complete with a sample of Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody\u201d), Delta Rae\u2019s songs are nothing if not honest about their messages. \n \nSpeaking of which, the band performed \u201cAll Good People,\u201d which they began work on before but released after this summer\u2019s Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. The song is a call to end racial injustice and violence toward black Americans, and it isn\u2019t afraid to bring up imagery from the headlines (the line \u201cour brothers cannot breathe\u201d definitely serves as a reminder of Eric Garner\u2019s death at the hands of the NYPD). \n \nThe crowd felt a surge of excitement at fan-favorite single \u201cBottom of the River,\u201d which is half spiritual, half \u201cSTOMP\u201d stage show. However, I\u2019d argue that the most impressive performance of the night was \u201cAny Better Than This,\u201d which the four vocalists harmonized around one mic to slight help from the bassist. It was impressive, it was understated and it was beautiful. \n \nDelta Rae closed with the aforementioned \u201cDance in the Graveyards,\u201d and then the crowd began to disperse \u2013 some going downtown, others returning to their residence halls. But all three acts left plenty for the Hokies to remember. \n \n\u201cI loved it. Especially the first week of school to boost things up. It was awesome,\u201d Stafford said. \n \n\u201cI thought it was great. I\u2019m a big fan of Delta Rae, so I thought it was exciting,\u201d said Grace Herrick, a junior biology major. \n \nIt\u2019s safe to say the concert provided a nice set-up for the Class of 2017 to make its mark. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s finally our year to make some noise,\u201d Finn said.", "source": "Collegiate Times"}
