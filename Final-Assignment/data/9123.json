It was the same with Ipswich, because they had to come at us. \n \n\u201cSo I put him in the line-up. It is also that luck but, of course, the main thing is his quality. As a player, he has to do it and he has to cope with the pressure.\u00a0 \n \n\"What we have seen until now: he can do it.\" \n \nVan Gaal was also asked by journalists at his press conference on Friday ahead of United's game with Sunderland if Martial had been distracted by the media coverage he had received in recent weeks. \n \n\"No, I don't think so because he doesn't read the papers,\" the Dutchman replied. \n \n\"Maybe he hears it from his fellow players, but I don't think the players will say that he can break a record. His personality is that he is an open guy, he is listening, he is watching, he is focusing on the matches.\u00a0 \n \n\"For a manager, he is a very coachable player and that is also why I bought him.\"", "source": "London Evening Standard"}
