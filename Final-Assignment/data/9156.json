Upon entering the clink, \u201cKim\u201d finds herself cellmates with a gorgeous woman who shows her how to loosen up and let her hair down.\n\nVia the NY Daily News:\nThe NSFW book paints steamy images in the readers\u2019 head of the changes Kim is experiencing behind bars.\n\u201cOne day I\u2019m standin\u2019 on the side of the Lord against sexual perversion, and the next I\u2019m in prison orange watchin\u2019 a buck nekkid m\u2014\u2014 vixen \u2019bout to do impure things to herself and to my soul in one single, terrifyin\u2019 act,\u201d the character says in the novel.\n\nSt. Augustine certainly nails Davis\u2019 folksy twang. You can almost hear her self-righteous voice utter those words tinged with both self-hatred and excitement.\n\nSpeaking with The Huffington Post, St. Augustine remarked that she created the novella \u201cto poke fun at [people who use religion to deny others their rights]\u201d and also give\u00a0\u201creaders satisfaction not only in the typical erotica sense but also of seeing a character do some things that, in the real world, would obviously\u00a0be anathema to the kinds of people we\u2019re talking about.\u201d An additional pleasure St. Augustine sought? \u201cThere can be\u00a0pleasure in irony sometimes.\u00a0And hopefully readers will\u00a0get a\u00a0chuckle or two while we\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\nAn eBook copy of this masterpiece can be yours for only $.99.\n\nThe post There\u2019s Now A Lesbian Erotic Novel About Kim Davis\u2019 Stint in Jail appeared first on Towleroad.\n\n     \n\n\n\nvia Towleroad News #gay http://ift.tt/1JqrKRs", "source": "Bulgebull.com"}
