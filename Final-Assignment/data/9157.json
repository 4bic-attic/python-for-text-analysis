Truro Running Club fittingly won their home race, their second win of the year and fourth podium placing. The host club finished eleven points clear of Cornwall AC, with Carn Runner, also climbing on to the podium for the fourth time in 2015, in third place. \n\nThe Men's race is usually a 'shoot out' between Cornwall AC, Newquay Road Runners and Hayle Runners, as was again the case at Truro. This time a strong Newquay squad were comfortable winners, with Cornwall AC again filling the runner's up spot, ahead of Hayle Runners. \n\nFull report and pictures see this week's West Briton. \n\nKEY FOR CLUBS \n\nBRR Bodmin Road Runners, BR Bude Rats, CAC Cornwall AC, CR Carn Runners, ECH East Cornwall Harriers, EVH Erme Valley Harriers, FRR Falmouth Road Runners, HR Hayle Runners, LRR Launceston Road Runners, MBH Mounts Bay Harriers, MCTR Mud Crew Trail Runners, NRR Newquay Road Runners, PH Plymouth Harriers, STA St Austell Running Club, TRC Truro Running Club, TT Tamer Trotters, U Unattached. \n\nRESULTS \n\nMen : 1 Colin Snook CAC 1.15.36, 2 Tom Joyce U 1.18.18, 3 Jordan Morant HR 1.18.43, 4 Paul Whear CAC 1.18.56, 5 Ross Farrer PH 1.19.22, 6 Daniel Costello HR 1.19.56, 7 Tony Wright NRR 1.20.37, 8 Dave Bartlett NRR 1.20.49, 9 Paul Smith CAC 1.20.54, 10 Alex Daniels NRR 1.20.59 .
