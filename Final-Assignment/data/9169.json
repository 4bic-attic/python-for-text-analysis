But researchers with Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs report some deeply depressing news: Eighty-seven of 91 (96%) deceased former NFL players whose brains were recently tested for the degenerative disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy had it \u2014 bringing the total CTE-positive brains in the league-established research repository to 131 out of 165, or 79%. \n\r \n\r\n\tNote that this is not a representative sample; players generally only donate their brains for study when they suspect problems. \n\r \n\r\n\tMoreover, the NFL reports that concussions are down in regular season games and head-to-head hits are declining in practice. \n\r \n\r\n\tBut football remains a very dangerous game, a fact the NFL failed to forthrightly face for years. \n\r \n\r\n\tSo watch, wince \u2014 and press for more reform. \n\r \u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n\u00a0", "source": "New York Daily News"}
