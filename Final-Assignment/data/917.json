Many prefer blondes. But when it comes to security most like it easy. \n \nAccording to an ongoing government survey started in October 2014, as part of the\u00a0Cyber Streetwise campaign, your password is likely to be a bit rubbish in all honesty. \n \nIn fact 3 in 4 Brits favour a list of most popular passwords that seems to have come not from a good practice document but rather\u00a0from a dump detailing the most suckish login credentials found in the latest data breach. \n \nPerennial favourites, such as dates and places of birth and pet names \u2013 which are insecure \u2018secret questions\u2019 at best \u2013 still figure prominently among the nation\u2019s favourites, as do the following selective gems taken from an Express feature on the 25 most popular passwords of 2014 \u2013 \n  123456  password  12345  12345678  qwerty  123456789  1234  1234567  letmein  abc123  \u00a0111111  access  696969  123123   \nAs I\u2019m sure most of you are aware, weak passwords make it incredibly easy for hackers to gain control of your accounts and devices because they can be cracked with insane ease. \n \nSo why do so many people persist in using short, easy to guess passwords instead of longer, more complex alternatives using a combination of letters, numbers and symbols? \n \nSimplicity would be my guess. \n \nIn a world where more and more devices are connecting to the internet, in which we need to maintain an increasingly large number of accounts for all our online activities, the number of login credentials we require\u00a0and need to remember is growing at quite a rate (if you aren\u2019t already using one, a password manager such as LastPass or KeePass is a great tool that will cut down the number of passwords you need to remember to just one). \n \nWhile I\u2019m sure many people are using simple passwords for ease of use and don\u2019t risk them on accounts of great importance, equally I can envisage a significant minority using \u201c123456\u201d as their password on every single account in their possession (if that sounds like you remember that one compromise of your login credentials will open up all your accounts to the attacker). \n \nThat\u2019s worrying for them, it\u2019s also worrying for you if you are employing them. \n \nWhat are you doing to ensure that your employees are security aware and able to adequately protect not only their own digital assets but yours too? \n \nBecause you can bet your bottom dollar that someone who prefers ease of use at home is highly unlikely to change their mindset when they come into work. \n \nWhile\u00a0I firmly believe that security can be made far more complex than it needs to be, or at least presented in a way that appears anything but clear, there is equal risk in making it too simple. \n \nSo watch out for your employees \u2013 until a viable alternative finally kills off the humble password , 3 in 4 of them may need your help, both for their sakes and for yours.", "source": "SecurityWatch"}
