This post will be updated and re-shared throughout the \u2026 Read more Read more Top Deals To celebrate Transparent\u2019s five wins at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, Amazon is selling Prime subscriptions for just $67, today only. That\u2019s $32 less than usual, and the best deal they\u2019ve ever offered on their marquee (and increasingly prolific) service. The unfortunate catch here is that the deal is only for new members. In the past, there\u2019s been a loophole to buy discounted Prime gift subscriptions, and then \u201cgift\u201d them to yourself when your own membership expired, but it seems like they\u2019ve totally shut that down this time. As soon as you check out, the membership will be immediately applied to your account, and your account only: No gifting allowed. And if you already have Prime, you won\u2019t be allowed to check out at all. That\u2019s a bummer, but this is still an amazing deal for anyone who hasn\u2019t tried the best deal in tech. [Amazon Prime, $67] GoPro\u2019s lilliputian Hero4 Session only came out a few months ago, but it just got one of the best GoPro discounts I\u2019ve ever seen. Not only do you save $100 on the camera\u2019s $400 MSRP, you\u2019ll also get a $40 Amazon gift card tossed in for free.

As soon your power goes out, the APC\u2019s built-in battery will kick in to keep your modem, router, and other low-draw electronics running for up to 4.5 hours. That\u2019s not going to help much during a major natural disaster, but it\u2019s awesome if you experience brief outages with any regularity.

Granted, $25 isn\u2019t a huge discount, but it\u2019s best we\u2019ve seen to date on the Apple Watch. More importantly though, most buyers won\u2019t have to pay sales tax, which sweetens the deal considerably compared to buying directly from Apple. [Apple Watch Sport 42mm, $375.
