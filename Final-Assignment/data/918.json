We are really happy with the amount we raised for Oxfam. \n\n\"Finley Browns Cafe was the perfect little venue to host the second part of our fundraising event. The owners, Martin and Faye, were so accommodating and really keen to get involved and help Oxjam Teignmouth.\" \n\nThe Oxjam Teignmouth Takeover will take place on October 16 at Teignmouth Rugby Club from 7pm. \n\nTickets are available from www.wegottickets.com, Teignmouth Oxfam Shop, Teignmouth Rugby Club, Teignmouth Tourist Information Centre and Finley Browns.", "source": "Torquay Herald Express"}
