That makes us stronger.\" \n \nHowever, Draxler said there was still room for improvement and felt Wolfsburg\u00a0could have finished the game off sooner. \n \n\"At home, a 1-0 win and I scored a goal, this is of course very nice,\" he continued. \n \n\"But we could also have had peace of mind sooner. We have kept the game open for too long. But this is to complain at a high level. \n \n\"Especially in the first half we played very good football and we\u00a0deserved our win in the end.\" \n \nSpeaking about his own performance, Draxler added: \"This was an increase compared to my performance in Ingolstadt. \n \n\"But every game is different anyway. This time it has a very good fit.\"", "source": "Goal.com"}
