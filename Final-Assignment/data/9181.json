Walker then led a 10-play, 50-yard drive in 1:03 which led to Jones' field goal. Walker threw for 391 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. \n\nFrohnapfel threw for 393 yards and three touchdowns. UMass' Tajae Sharpe had 11 catches for 156 yards to become the program's all-time leading receiver with 188 receptions, passing Adrian Zullo's 187.", "source": "Fresno Bee"}
