The Buffs provided plenty of highlights in a blowout win. And, perhaps most fittingly of all, Larry Zimmer was back behind the microphone calling all the action. \n \nBack in action after missing the final six games of the 2014 season due to an illness \u2014 the only games he has missed in the past 21 of his 41 seasons calling CU games \u2014 Zimmer's return on Saturday to his familiar booth atop Folsom Field was an immensely gratifying finish line in his long road to recovery. \n \n\"It felt great and I thank God this day occurred,\" Zimmer said. \"In all the days that I was in the hospital and the days I was doing rehab, I couldn't walk after being three months on my back. I had to learn all that over again. But there was never a doubt in my mind this day would come.\" \n \nIncluding early stints calling games for Michigan and CSU, this will mark Zimmer's 50th season on the air. It also will be his last. Zimmer always considered walking away after reaching that milestone plateau, and after the trials of the past year he is grateful it will happen on his terms. \n \nZimmer was invited by coach Mike MacIntyre to speak to the team this week, and Zimmer used the opportunity to thank the players and entire program for their support. \n\n \n\"I didn't want that game in last October to be my last,\" Zimmer said. \"There was a goal in mind to get back.\"", "source": "Broomfield Enterprise Online"}
