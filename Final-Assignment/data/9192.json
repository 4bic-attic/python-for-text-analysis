Sometimes I don't and I'm in it!\n\nLast week we trashed Transporter Refueled, you know the one without Jason Stathom. Low and behold, we were spot on with our predictions. The movie, which cost $21 million to make didn't even break even! It brought in a whopping $3.4 million. I'm willing to bet that that is the cost of one stunt. Needless to say, wait for it on HBO or Netflix.\n\nSo let's move on to this week! Billy Kidd and I Trailer Trash M. Night Shyamalan's new horror flick, The Visit! He's due for a good movie right? Fingers crossed this is it because I really want to see it!\n\nGrowing up, I always loved to stay with my grandparents. However, these just might be the creepiest grandparents I've ever seen! And leave it to Billy to bring down the show with his dead grandma. Whomp, whomp!\n\nI think my favorite part of this trailer is the \"their just old\" excuse! I will use the crap out of that when I get older. I will steal and yell at people. It will be amazing! In this case though, it looks like grandma and grandpa will use the excuse to justify eating their grandkids. I mean she did ask politely that the oldest one clean the oven. And if these kids get eaten, it really is their own fault! Grandma and grandpa warned them to stay in their rooms after 9PM!\n\nAnyway, long story short...of course I'm going to see this movie! It looks awesome fun and scary! And I'll do it while I gnaw on a baby arm!\n\nSee you next week for another episode of Trailer Trash!", "source": "98.7 KLUV"}
