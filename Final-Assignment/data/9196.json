The move will be completed by Dec. 31. Employees have been notified and were given the option to move to Columbus, which is in the southeastern corner of Kansas. \n \n\u201cThe lease in our current building was coming to an end,\u201d Osterloh said in an email. \u201cAfter reviewing our leasing options within Omaha and the surrounding area, the decision was made to relocate to a company-owned facility.\u201d \n \nEnnis\u2019 website shows it also owns Calibrated, another printing company, in Columbus. Ennis is headquartered in Midlothian, Texas. \n \nThe approximately 152,000-square-foot building on I Street is listed for sale at $7.25 million. Its owner, Mark Wright, said the decision to put it on the market was made after he learned Folder Express would not renew its lease. \n \nFolder Express has been making folders in Omaha since 1927, it says. It specializes in custom presentation folders and was acquired by Ennis in 2013. \n \nContact the writer:\u00a0 402-444-1414, paige.yowell@owh.com", "source": "Omaha World-Herald"}
