Over the next few weeks we are going to learn some of the features of Paint so we can make \u2018draw\u2019 or \u2018paint\u2019 the best picture we can on the computer.\n\nFirst we need to load the program \u2013 we need to find the correct icon \u2013 It might not be on the main page but in the program menu \u2013 in accessorise!\n\nThis week we are going to use the brushes tool and fill tool to create our own version of Yellow Island.\n\n\n\nBrushes allow us to leave marks like lots of different types of pens, pencils and brushes.\n\n\n\nThe paint can lets us fill a space with lots of colour \u2013 but be careful any gaps and the paint will pour out!\n\n\u2013 remember what colour is in in color (American spelling of colour!) is the colour you will draw or paint.\n\nOne of the most important things we will learn today is UNDO \u2013 if we don\u2019t like what we have just done we can undo it \u2013 take it off the page \u2013 in Art with paint this is something we can\u2019t do \u2013 What does the icon look like? If you reply on the blog this week you will get a BEST point.\n\nOnce we have drawn our picture we will need to save it carefully.", "source": "A window into our Year 2 Classroom."}
