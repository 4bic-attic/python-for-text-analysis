It was the first whales he had seen in Byron during this season's migration south, but others had spotted them earlier, he said. \n\nHumpbacks are generally seen from the east Australian coast from September to November, swimming back towards the Southern Ocean after spending the winter months in warmer waters to mate and give birth.", "source": "Good Fruit & Vegetables Magazine"}
