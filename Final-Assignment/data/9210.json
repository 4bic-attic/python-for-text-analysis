He threw a 48-yard touchdown to Josh Bellamy. But the injury on Jefferson\u2019s interception return was another big blow for a team that was already missing its top receiver with Alshon Jeffery out because of a hamstring problem.Now, the Bears could be missing their quarterback when they visit defending NFC champion Seattle. That would likely mean a start for Jimmy Clausen, who was 14 of 23 for 121 yards after Cutler went down.Clauson\u2019s long pass on the opening drive of the second half got picked off by Patrick Peterson, leading to a 28-yard touchdown catch by Fitzgerald that made it 35-20. David Johnson added a 13-yard scoring run on Arizona\u2019s next possession that bumped the lead to 22 points, sending Arizona to a lopsided victory after a wild first half.Along with Johnson\u2019s team record return on the game\u2019s opening kickoff, there were two long pass-interference penalties by Chicago\u2019s Kyle Fuller and Alan Ball that led to touchdowns for the Cardinals. The Bears also got a pair of field goals in the final minute of the half thanks to a fumble recovery on a punt and an interception by Jared Allen.", "source": "Titans Radio"}
