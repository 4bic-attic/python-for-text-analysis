Seen a few, including one of the largest bucks I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. \n \nBut I never got a shot. \n \nWell, there was the young buck I shot at on Atchafalaya Delta Wildlife Management Area \u2014 but I don\u2019t even want to go into that embarrassing miss. \n \nIt\u2019s just a different animal than hunting private land. But there are those, like Morgan City\u2019s Ricky Aucoin, who somehow make a habit of downing public-land deer. \n \nAnd it\u2019s the challenge that attracts these accomplished hunters. \n \n\u201cIs it easy?\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cOf course not. If it were, the reward would be greatly diminished.\u201d \n \nThis die-hard hunter has killed a lot of deer, including some really nice bucks. To date, he\u2019s taken five 8-pointers, one 9-point, a 10-point and an 11-pointer from lands our tax dollars purchased. \n \nSo what are the keys to public-land hunting? \n \nAucoin, who hosted me on my ill-fated Atchafalaya Delta WMA hunt and still laughs about it after more than a decade, said it just takes a commitment to success and the willingness to learn from others. \n \n\u201cSuccessful hunting on public land is possible for any hunter who is willing to put in the necessary time and effort,\u201d he explained. \u201cI have hunted on public land for 33 years. In those years, through trial and error, a ton of sweat, thousands of\u00a0mosquito bites and the good advice of those who hunted before and with me, I have learned a thing or two about successfully harvesting deer and hogs on public land, WMAs and NWRs.\u201d \n \nHere are some of his other tips: \n \n\u2022 Learn before you go \u2014 Aucoin said you can never learn too much about the area you want to hunt. \n \n\u201cAfter you choose the public land you are interested in hunting, research it as much as possible in the state hunting pamphlet, and familiarize yourself with the seasons and rules for that area,\u201d he said. \u201cNext access\u00a0the Internet and use Google maps to get a good aerial view of the layout of the land. Notice the access areas, which might be by truck, boat or four-wheeler. Look for potential areas to scout, paying attention to roads, trails, lakes, ponds, funnel areas, etc. \n \n\u201cContact the manager of the WMA or NWR for general information. Look at local hunting websites for those hunters who frequent that area and might volunteer advice on how to access the area and other tips, such as good food sources and type of stands successfully used in that area.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Scout often and early \u2014 There is just no such thing as too much scouting, he said. \n \n\u201cArmed with a good knowledge of the area, prepare to make as many scouting trips as possible, well in advance of the beginning of the season,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cDon\u2019t be that guy who shows up on the afternoon before the first day of the season and proceeds to tromp around spreading human scent everywhere. \n \n\"That guy defeats all of the other hunters who did get out in the field weeks before and thoroughly scouted and prepared a strategy. Instead, start early and taper off your scouting trips as the season approaches.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Do unto others \u2014 Aucoin said that it\u2019s not too late to scout if you decide to go after the season has started, but it\u2019s important to time your scouting so it doesn\u2019t disturb other hunters. \n \n\u201c If you do get a late start or want to try a WMA mid-season, respect your fellow hunters,\u201d he said. \u201cTry to do your scouting during the middle of the day when 98 percent of the hunters are done for the day or back at camp taking a nap. Use your scout to set up an afternoon hunt that day or find a good area to come back for a future hunt. \n \n\u201cWhen you decide to leave, be courteous to your fellow hunters and exit as quietly as you came in. Many times I have heard guys start talking loudly and making all kind of racket simply because their hunt is over. These same guys would be the first to complain if you did the same to them. Treat other hunters with respect, just as you want to be treated.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Locate the right places \u2014 Scouting isn\u2019t just about finding tracks, this veteran public-land hunter said. \n \n\u201cWhile scouting, look for food sources, natural funnels, water sources, thick and nasty areas \u2014 as well as other hunters\u2019 flagged trails,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cPublic-land trails are not exclusive to the one who flags or makes them, though I personally am not going to hunt a spot that someone else has taken the time to find. \n \n\u201cBy studying the trails made by other hunters, you can use a strategy to hunt a spot that hunter pressure will drive the deer to. Of course, using that strategy you want to be the first one out there on opening day.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Avoid the crowds \u2014 If you\u2019re not one who enjoys seeing or hearing other hunters, put in more effort by moving as far into the woods as possible from the access points. \n \n\u201cUsually the deeper you head into the woods, the less likely you are to encounter other hunters,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cMany will only hunt the most easily accessible areas near the roads or waterways.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Get the picture (when it\u2019s legal) \u2014 Trail cameras have become invaluable scouting tools for many private-land hunters, but those hunting public tracts can also make use of them. Just be sure it\u2019s legal on the piece of property you plan to target; cameras are illegal on national wildlife refuges, for instance. \n \n\u201cGame cams can be very useful when trying to decide on an area to hunt, but bear in mind that on public land there lurk a few undesirables, who might make your camera disappear,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cAgain, choosing an area that is difficult to access increases the chances of your camera making it through the season safely.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Keep your options open \u2014 It\u2019s not out of the question for you to show up one morning and find another hunter set up in your favorite spot, so it\u2019s best to identify several likely stand sites. \n \n\u201cWhen scouting, be sure to pick out multiple areas that could be successful, because the phrase 'first come, first served. means exactly that: You cannot reserve your spot,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cYou may need a Plan B, C or even D. Getting out there early allows you some time to move to another location if it becomes necessary and still get set up well before daylight. Being early, also allows you to enter slowly and quietly.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Plan your routes \u2014 Sometimes the direct route to your hunting spot might not be best. \n \n\u201cNotice the deer trails, and begin to figure your entry and exit strategy to least intrude on the deer traffic and to be able to approach your stand location favorable to the wind conditions,\u201d Aucoin said. \n \n\u2022 Go the distance \u2014 Sometimes it\u2019s not the early bird that gets the worm, so don\u2019t give up at 9 a.m. when everyone else heads out of the woods for a break. \n \n\u201cMost hunters leave their stands fairly early in the morning. You might want to stay in your stand until they have all gone,\u201d Aucoin said. \u201cThe deer do pattern the hunters\u2019 arrivals and departures. You might be surprised at what you see mid-morning. Another strategy that works, especially on full-moon days, is to hunt the middle of the day; usually you will have the woods to yourself, and most times you will not disturb anyone entering or leaving the area.\u201d \n \n\u2022 Hunt the off times \u2014 If you\u2019ve got a lot of vacation time, burn some days hunting while most people are working. \n \n\u201cOn public land, Friday afternoon through Sunday morning and on any holiday period is, by far, the most-crowded time to be out there,\u201d Aucoin pointed out. \u201cIf\u00a0 your schedule allows, try hunting on weekdays. The pressure is so much less during the week \u2014 especially during bow season.\u201d", "source": "Louisiana Sportsman"}
