Makes one think of the proverb: \u201cWhere there is no vision the people fail . . .\u201d\nA study of the scripture reveals that Solomon does three very important things before receiving God\u2019s blessing:\n- First, Solomon SEEKS God directly - WALKING in the ways of his father David and MAKING SACRAFICES to Him . . . in the high places.\nHow often do we intentionally do this in our day to day lives? Can you think of any moments where you did (or maybe didn\u2019t) and felt like the Spirit responded directly?\nOne that comes to mind for me happened several years ago when I was invited on a yearly fishing trip with several doctors and their sons. It just so happened that it was at a time when God was really putting a claim upon me and on the first morning of the trip, prior to our driving out to the point at Cape Hatteras for a long day of surfcasting, I went out on the beach with my bible and because the sand was wet I walked up and down the beach reading it in lieu of sitting down.\nI know at least some of my large fishing party had seen me but no one said anything. Since I was the \u201cnewbie\u201d on the trip they probably just thought I was a \u201cdifferent religious sort of duck.\u201d\nBut that afternoon with about 18 rods in the water mine was the ONLY one that caught fish \u2013 two nice puppy drum as I recall \u2013 large enough to later serve the whole group for dinner.\nNext day \u2013 same devotional time \u2013 same results \u2013 except I caught THREE fish. No one else caught anything. Except a puffer fish which just added insult to injury for the more serious fisherman among them.\nI remember my friend Mark, who had invited me on the trip, giving me a few sideways glances that seemed to say, \u201cYou better stop catching these fish or you may wind up taking an unscheduled swim out on Diamond Shoals . . .\u201d\nBut I was indeed invited back the following year. And it\u2019s here that things got a little overtly spooky. The SAME thing happened. I caught all of the fish - except for one. It was as if the Holy Spirit finally felt a little sorry for them. One night over dinner one of them asked, \u201cWhat are you reading in the morning when you walk up and down the beach Stuart?\u201d (Which was interesting because I KNOW he already knew the answer.)\n\u201cThe Bible,\u201d I answered flatly.\nHis curiosity and willingness to serve the ball up in front of the whole crew was apparently rewarded - as he happened to be the guy that later caught the only other fish.\nThink what you want. Maybe most people would just write it off as bizarre coincidence \u2013 but I think God was after at least one of those guys \u2013 and far more likely - all of them.\nWho was willing to take notice after such a whisper and begin to more intentionally seek? I will never know.\n- The second things Solomon does in our reading is RECOGNIZE his own inferiority for the job! He KNOWS HIS NEED of God. \u201cI am only a little child \u2013 I do not know how to go out or come in!\u201d\nWell there it is \u2013 humility, humility, humility! Solomon thankfully has the \u201chumbleness gene\u201d that his father David did!\nThink of all the places where you\u2019ve started with too much self-confidence and failed. And then think of those moments where you went in fully aware of your limitations? Which ones worked out best?\nYep. I thought so.\nThe point is a simple one \u2013 God does not (and maybe cannot) work with a haughty heart \u2013 but rather only a halting one. One that knows in it\u2019s in its very best moments that apart from God we are NOTHING! It\u2019s the core of the doctrine of Neo-orthodoxy and it\u2019s a truth that very few of us ever get until our hearts have been purged and cleaned by God\u2019s unfathomable Grace.\nI remember riding to a church conference with my friend and minister at that time George Anderson. We had another good friend who was riding in the back seat and he overheard a discussion we were having about Neo-orthodoxy and the need to know how fallen we are apart from God. I think one of us had quoted Frederick Buechner who describes us as both \u201cworms and slobs\u201d apart from God. The backseat friend chimed in:\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I agree \u2013 I know who I am and I have some goodness in me \u2013 in fact, a lot of the good I do is because I was raised right and know the difference between right and wrong. I am not a bad person on my own.\u201d\nWell, Yes . . . and absolutely NO!\nI remember George made an impassioned yet balanced effort to explain the idea that any and all goodness that we know, experience and exhibit ourselves ultimately comes from God (even, of course, that which his parents had taught him). But it was clear after further conversation that the idea wasn\u2019t much accepted. And I completely forgot about the moment - for about two years.\nAnd then one day while sharing a glass of wine on a front porch with the same individual the conversation turned toward \u201ckey moments\u201d of understanding in our lives and the friend spoke up and said: \u201cDo you remember that time we were on our way to that conference and you guys were talking about Neo-orthodoxy and right and wrong and the fallen-ness of man?\u201d\u00a0 We acknowledged that we did. \u201cWell,\u201d he said simply, \u201cI absolutely and completely know what you were talking about now . . .\u201d He flashed a soft humble smile. \u201cI get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had a long way to go at the time . . . I guess I still do.\u201d\nWe all do, of course. But knowing one\u2019s need of God would very much seem to be a pre-requisite for the sanctification that is sure to follow if we humbly SEEK Him and RECOGNIZE our need of Him.\nFinally, the third thing Solomon does is the he actually ASKS for help. \u201cGive therefore your servant an understanding mind.\u201d\nAnd God responds!\nThink of all the times that Jesus in his discussions with the Disciples implores them to take their needs to the Father in prayer. And not something like, \u201cI would like more sheep,\u201d or \u201cI would like a raise\u201d \u2013 or a date with the cute girl in the front row or maybe winning the lottery. But rather needs that relate to how we might become a better person - in order to accomplish God\u2019s will in the world.\nWhen is the last time you asked God for something along those lines?\nThe truth, of course, is that we should all be able to say, \u201cThis morning!\u201d But my guess is that most of us can\u2019t. And it is something that, as Christians, we should be doing each and every day.\nOf all the things that Jesus said about prayer \u2013 staying at it \u2013 being persistent \u2013 really, really, really persistent - seems to be the most important thing! Think of the parable of the crooked judge and the sleeping friend. \u201cBe importunate and relentless in prayer!\u201d Jesus says . . . AND ASK GOD \u2013 for what you need to be the person that HE created you to be!\nLike Solomon - don\u2019t be shy about it! ASK!\nOur second reading from the Gospel of John takes us in a completely different direction. Hear now the word of the Lord as it comes to us from\nGOSPEL JOHN 6:51-58\n51\"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\"\n52The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\"\u00a053So Jesus said to them, \"Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\u00a054Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day;\u00a055for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.\u00a056Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.\u00a057Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.\u00a058This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.\"\nThe grass withers and the flower fades but the Word of the Lord endures forever \u2013 Amen.\nWell \u2013 here we have it \u2013 Christ as the Word made flesh declaring why he came and how we must partake of him to have eternal life.\nAnd of course the first thing the Jews do is \u201cdispute among themselves\u201d (that is argue about) - \u201cHow can this man give us his flesh to eat?\u201d Imagine that - they take him literally at his word and in so doing completely miss the point! Which is, of course, exactly what we so often do! Instead of looking THROUGH the window of his word, we want to look right at it \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing there to be found in the ink letters or the paper it\u2019s written on!\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just have it in black and white?\u201d we ask. Like Thomas we want Jesus to give us a manual!\u00a0 Something that will tell us exactly what to do and say so we can follow the formula and get it just right. Well God tried that once! It\u2019s called the LAW! And as we have seen and experienced we don\u2019t do so very well with that!\nSo Jesus comes \u2013 and gives us himself - the LIVING Word - and says partake of ME . . . Bring MY flesh into YOUR flesh \u2013 and MY blood into your blood . . . and I will show you truths about who you are that you would otherwise NEVER know . . . I will give you TRUE LIFE!\nIt is reminiscent of God\u2019s commandment to the prophet Ezekiel \u2013 who was told to literally \u201ceat\u201d God\u2019s Word: \u201cAnd he said to me, \u201cSon of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.\u201d\u00a0So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.\u00a0Then he said to me, \u201cSon of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.\u201d So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.\u201d\nBut the people were exceedingly hard hearted and self-reliant (sound familiar?) and they did not have anything close to the humility of Solomon in asking for the wisdom to discern God\u2019s truth. And likewise, the vast majority of us reject Jesus as someone to be received as the very sustenance of our lives \u2013 the main staple upon which we are to subsist. In fact, most Americans are clearly more interested in dessert \u2013 or other junk food that has no real nutritional value.\nAnd if you watch what the core of our culture values these days you might more specifically say a great many of us are eating poison \u2013 that which is not only NOT of God, and not only that which simply serves to take the place of God, but rather that which chokes off and kills ANY opportunity to receive the love and grace he intends for us.\nTruly. We live in a world that has all but gone mad.\nRemember the old saying, \u201cYou are what you eat . . .\u201d It is, of course, true \u2013 we are! The food we take into our bodies give us the very proteins, carbohydrates, nutrients and enzymes that both feed and eventually become part of our physical selves.\nLikewise spiritually, the life sustaining Word of God (made flesh and blood in Jesus), is that which can and will become part of who WE ARE! If we will \u2013 in complete and utter humility -recognize our need for him \u2013 seek him - and ask him into our lives!\nWhen we eat something that is good for us \u2013 it helps us in so many ways: it gives us energy \u2013 it makes us strong \u2013 it builds our immunity and helps us defend against invasive enemies. And it also has the added benefit of improving our outward appearance to others.\nBut most importantly it improves our inward appearance as well \u2013 it affects how we FEEL \u2013 so that we can fully be ourselves (as God intended) to others. Indeed, \u201cliving ON the right stuff\u201d is critically important.\nBut even though most of us KNOW that, we so often eat that which is not good for us at all! Because it \u201ctastes good\u201d in the short term \u2013 sugar, carbs, salt \u2013 anything with high fructose corn syrup . . . Mmmmm give me some of that!\nI just had Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream for the first time at the beach last week. It was something called \u201cEverything but the kitchen sink.\u201d It has chocolate and, caramel and almonds and big chunks of sweet vanilla and who knows what else. My Goodness! I can tell you that lab rats will keep pushing the bar for that stuff until they weigh 300 pounds in rat weight and die!\nThe truth is, or course, that there is just so much out there that is not very good for us and it comes in so very many different forms doesn\u2019t it?\nWell \u2013 spiritually speaking the same is true as well. But there is only ONE \u201cdiet\u201d that will do \u2013 and that is by feeding on the living Word of God in the person of Jesus Christ. \u201cTRUE food\u201d \u2013 and \u201cTRUE drink\u201d as he referred to himself. He is the ONLY way in which our true selves will ever be restored to their original condition.\nSo. We must ask ourselves \u2013 and answer honestly: Are we really feeding on him? Every day?\nAnd not just on the stories and words that taught us so much how to live - as on HIM?\nHe who would give up everything - EVERYTHING - for the poor, wretched creatures that we are? Most of whom can\u2019t so much as muster up enough real passion to even show up in church once a week in an effort to better know him . . . Much less show up for one another every day - as he said we must do?\nIt is a short and uncertain life my friends. Let us all get right with God in the only way he told us we could.\nLet us truly \u2013 completely and absolutely - feed on him.\n\n\n\tStuart Revercomb", "source": "Peace Sermons"}
