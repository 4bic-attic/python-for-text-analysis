Baby\nyou're the eight ball\nin the hole.\n\nYou are my fulfillment.\nYou are my happiness.\nYou are my pot of gold.\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nYou're the cream of the\ncrop.  Baby you're the\nbest.\n\nAll the conditions\nrequired of a man to\nwin my love you have\nachieved.\n\nThe fact that you are\ncapable, more than\nwilling and able,\nyou have proven to me.\n\nWith flying colors,\nyou've passed all the\nrequired tests.\n\nYou're the cream of\nthe crop.  Oh what a\nsure shot.  Baby you're\nvery well trained.\n\nYou've got what it\ntakes and you know how\nto use it.\n\nFor you it comes easy.\nThere's nothing to it.\n\nOnly you can do it how\nyou do it.  You've got\nthe brains.\n\nStay exactly the way\nyou are.  Don't you\never change.\n\nHow would you feel if\nI told you that for\nso long, I've been \nwaiting for a guy like\nyou to come along.\n\nThe feelings that I\nhave for you are strong.\n\nI crave for your love.\nI just can't get enough.\nI'll never give it up.\nMy loving you is not wrong.\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nYou come with no bells.\n\nI've got my eyes on you.\nIt's hard for me to take\nthem off of you.  Can't\nyou tell?\n\nSo many other guys can\nonly wish they possessed\nthe qualities you've got.\n\nSuch fine eminence.  All\nthe reasons why I fell.\n\nKeep on doing what you're\ndoing.  Don't stop.\n\nYou were born for pleasing me.\nYou were made for me.  I\nneed you beside me to make\nme happy.  Only you know\nexactly how to hit the spot.\nYou know all too well.\n\nOnly you can do what you\ndo.  You've stolen my\nheart.  In you I am lost.\n\nNo other could ever\nreplace you.  You are\nthe one I've chosen.\nYou're the one who holds\nmy heart.\n\nIt's been you right\nfrom the start.  Falling\nin love with you is a\nbridge I'm so thankful\nthat I crossed.\n\nAll of your deepest\nemotions lay bare.\n\nTell me of all your\nhopes and dreams.  Don't\nkeep them to yourself.\nCome clean.\n\nIt's far better to share.\nI would love to hear,\nbecause I care.\n\nYou're a sure shot.  All\nthat I've been looking\nfor in a man you've got.\n\nIt's easy to see, for\nit's not hidden.\n\nWhen it comes to fine\nquality, baby you're\nat the top.\n\nYou're all I want and\nmore.  Making you fall\nin love with me is my\nmaster plan.\n\nUntil I achieve that\ngoal I won't stop.\n\nYou're so perfect for\nme.  Love is not\nforbidden.\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nBaby you're true.\n\nCome to me.\nRun to me.\nNeed me the way\nthat I need you.\n\nBelieve in me.\nSee all there is\nto me.  Get to know\nme, inside and out.\n\nReceive me.  Never\ndeceive me.  Cleave\nto me loyally.  Hold me.\nShow me, don't just\ntell me, that you know\nwhat love is all about.\n\nIf love goes untried,\nthere will always be\ndoubt.\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nThe way you're turning\nme on, I'm hot to trot.\n\nWhen it comes to loving\nme, you give it all\nyou've got.\n\nAll I ask of you,\nwhatever you do, please\ndon't stop.\n\nYou're totally hot.\nYou're all the man that\nso many others are not.\nIf I said I loved you\nmadly, would I be wrong?\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nYou come with no whistles.\n\nSo authentic.  Nobody can\ntell you that you're not.\nBaby you sizzle.\n\nBaby you're always on\nmy mind.  Day and night,\nI think about you all\nthe time.\n\nNo one can tell me that\nI'm a fool for loving you\nthe way I do.  No one can\ntell me that I'm blind.\n\nI won't pay attention to\na single word they say.\nI'll just tell them to\nrun along and go their way.\nThey'll only be wasting\ntheir time.\n\nYou're a sure shot.  You\ncome with no extra fancy\nuseless gadgets.  You\ncome with no add-ons.\n\nYou're a sure shot, that's\nwhy there's no need for\nhesitating.\n\nA fool I am not.  I'm\ngoing for what I want.\nNo need for waiting.\n\nYou're a sure shot.\nWith you, I am certain.\n\nRest assured, they'll\nbe no second thoughts.\nI definitely won't be\nbringing down the curtains.", "source": "violapressley"}
