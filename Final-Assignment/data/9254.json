Gotham  co-stars and on-screen love interests Benjamin McKenzie and Morena Baccarin are expecting a baby together in real life, TMZ reports. Baccarin, 36, is expected to reveal her pregnancy at a court appearance Thursday as part of her ongoing divorce proceedings, according to TMZ. She is requesting full custody of her 1-year-old son with estranged husband Austin Chick because her pregnancy will prevent her from flying across the country to see him, TMZ reports. The Homeland  alum and McKenzie, 37, have not publicly confirmed their relationship, but attended Fox's Emmy Awards after party together on Sunday. Baccarin joined Gotham in Season 2 as a love interest for McKenzie's character, Commissioner Gordon. Other Links From TVGuide.com", "source": "Aurora Advertiser"}
