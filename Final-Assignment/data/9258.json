I'm happy because he scored three goals now in two victories and I'm very pleased with him. \n \n\"Maybe you can't see, he is a very friendly guy, after one week with the team he brought very good korean food to the training ground, and showed he is a humble, friendly guy. He also had some Japanese, Chinese. I had a big dish, I liked it a lot.\" \n \nConcerns persist that Son will prove too lightweight to have a long-term future in English football but his desire and athleticism highlighted the qualities that would have tempted Pochettino, a manager whose preference is for a high-tempo, aggressively-pressing style of football, to bring him to White Hart Lane. \n   Promoted stories   \n\"His character is to run a lot, I wanted to sign him because of his profile, he has energy, can press high with a high tempo,\" the manager said. \n \n\"The way we play, we dominated the game, more than 60 per cent of the ball, more chances than the opponent. I'm very pleased, we gave a big effort.  The players showed very good energy after a tough game against Qarabag.\" \n \nPochettino's visiting manager Alan Pardew, meanwhile, explained that his decision to substitute Wilfried Zaha at half-time, in place of Fraizer Campbell, was inspired by the forward's lack of desire. \n \n\"I didn't think Wilf played very well to be honest,\" he said. \n \n\"The issue with Wilf is that he is a fabulous footballer. I am trying to get him to understand that every game, every moment in every game, is very, very important. \n \n\"It is about concentration, and having that same desire, to defend, to attack, movement and everything, that top players produce. \n \n\"He had 45 minutes to show me he was up to speed on all of those areas. And he wasn't. So therefore he needs to take that away and be a lesson. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"He's not the first player, by any stretch of the imagination, who didn't do their job. He was perhaps unlucky to be taken off, because one or two others were just below their level. But he was probably the worst of the pack.\"", "source": "Campaign Series"}
