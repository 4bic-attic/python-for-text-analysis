The temporary reintroduction of border controls between Member States is an exceptional possibility explicitly foreseen in and regulated by the Schengen Borders Code, in case of a crisis situation. The current situation in Austria, prima facie, appears to be a situation covered by the rules. The measures taken by Austria, like those taken by Germany on 13 September, are provisional in nature. At the Extraordinary Council of Interior Ministers of 14 September , Member States stressed the need to fully apply the EU asylum and Schengen rules. As President Juncker said in his State of the Union speech : \" The free movement of people under Schengen is a unique symbol of European integration. However, the other side of the coin is a better joint management of our external borders and more solidarity in coping with the refugee crisis .\" The situation serves to further underscore the pressing need to agree on and quickly implement the measures proposed by the Commission in order to manage the refugee crisis.

This new system would replace the existing investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism in all ongoing and future EU investment negotiations, including the EU-US talks on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The proposal for an Investment Court System builds on the substantial input received from the European Parliament, Member States, national parliaments and stakeholders through the public consultation held on ISDS. It is intended to ensure that all actors can have full trust in the system. Built around the same key elements as domestic and international courts, it enshrines governments' right to regulate and ensures transparency and accountability. First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: \" With our proposals for a new Investment Court System, we are breaking new ground. The new Investment Court System will be composed of fully qualified judges, proceedings will be transparent, and cases will be decided on the basis of clear rules. With this new system, we protect the governments' right to regulate, and ensure that investment disputes will be adjudicated in full accordance with the rule of law \". Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m added: \" Today, we're delivering on our promise - to propose a new, modernised system of investment courts, subject to democratic principles and public scrutiny . We want to establish a new system built around the elements that make citizens trust domestic or international courts. I'm making this proposal public at the same time that I send it to the European Parliament and the Member States. It's very important to have an open and transparent exchange of views on this widely debated issue .\" The main elements of reform are outlined in a press release here , a reader's guide on the reform proposals is available here . Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m's press conference will be live streamed here .

The European Commission has repeatedly confirmed that this has been the case since the Court of Justice of the European Union annulled the EU Data Retention Directive in 2014. The Commission is not coming forward with new initiatives on data retention and in the absence of EU rules in this regard, Member States are free to maintain their legislation on data retention and to introduce national measures as they see fit.  Of course any laws must comply fully with the basic principles of EU law, such as those contained in the ePrivacy Directive . The full statement is available in EN , FR and DE .

BHF-KB is active in banking and wealth and asset management. Fosun has activities in insurance and banking, in the industrial sector (mainly pharmaceuticals, healthcare, steel and mining), as well as in investment and asset management. The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns because of the companies' moderate combined market shares on the markets concerned. The transaction was assessed under the simplified merger review procedure. More information is available on the Commission's competition website, in the Commission's public case register under the case number M.7735 .
