Regional safety concerns and increased defence spending also pose a challenge for the kingdom,\" it said.\n\nICAEW said Qatar's planned construction project investment of nearly $30 billion this year will contribute to strong 6.9 percent GDP growth, supported by the international expansion of many of its key businesses.\n\nIt added, however, that an area of risk may be the international investigation into the awarding of the 2020 FIFA World Cup, as it may have wider repercussions on international investors' views of the country.\n\nHealthy consumer spending and government investment in key development areas such as youth employment will support 1.7 percent 2015 growth in Kuwait, the report said.\n\n\"A substantial sovereign wealth fund will allow the country to deal with this year's projected fiscal deficit without major spending cuts, but continuing to develop non-oil industries will be essential,\" it added.\n\nICAEW said Oman's economy is expected to expand by 3.5 percent in 2015, partially fuelled by infrastructure projects such as the newly-opened desalination plant in Ghubra.\n\n\"Despite the fall in oil revenue, the sultanate plans to meet all spending commitments (in the short term at least) with a focus on boosting non-commodity sectors such as trade and manufacturing,\" the report noted.\n\n\u00a9 2015 ITP DIGITAL Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
