We don't know what the intent is. It's not known at this point if it's a copy-cat crime.\" \n\nOne person suffered a non-life threatening injury as a result of one of the shootings, according to authorities. \n\nMilstead said his department is appealing to the public for information from anybody who saw anything unusual on the freeway during the periods when the shots were fired. \n\n\"You should be concerned. We have some people or person shooting at moving vehicles on I-10,\" Milstead said. \"It has not ended in tragedy, but it could.\" \n\nTwo vehicles were struck in a half-hour span around 11 a.m. Saturday on I-10 between 19th and 59th avenues and a third vehicle was hit on I-10 near 16th Street about 10:15 p.m. Saturday, according to the DPS. \n\nA fourth vehicle was shot at around 4:25 a.m. Monday near 14th Avenue and I-10. \n\nA tour bus and an SUV were two of the vehicles fired upon, but DPS is withholding other specifics so their investigation won't be jeopardized. \n\nThe bullets have hit a windshield and a headlight and the rest have been side impacts on the passenger sides of the vehicles, Milstead said.", "source": "CBS News"}
