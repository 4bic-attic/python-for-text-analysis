He proved that as the defensive coordinator under Urban Meyer at Florida, and he proved that as the head coach at Louisville. But patience wears thin at Texas, and following Saturday\u2019s dud of a season-opening 38-3 loss at No. 11 Notre Dame, the second-year coach is under considerable heat. Not as much as his offensive coordinator, however. Strong told the Texas media on Monday that Shawn Watson will still be the play-caller when the Longhorns host Rice on Saturday, but also said nothing was set in stone after this weekend. \u201cWe can\u2019t go through another season with a bad offense,\u201d Strong said. That wouldn\u2019t be good for the long-term prospects of Watson or Strong. Texas went 6-7 in Strong\u2019s debut season, and he isn\u2019t close to again making this a premier program because of all the attrition that took place under his arrival. The university needs to give him time to get it done, and Strong is more than capable. His first two Louisville teams went 7-6, but then Strong led the Cardinals to records of 11-2 in 2012 and 12-1 in 2013. Plus, as defensive coordinator at Florida, he was critical to the Gators winning national championships in 2006 and 2008. \u201cMillions and millions of people are involved in this program, and we have to give them hope,\u201d Strong said. \u201cThey have to see progress.\u201d Patience. It\u2019s what Texas fans and the administration should have with Strong. AROUND THE NATION UCLA defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes is out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

Page 2 of 2 - MY FINAL FOUR I vote in the Sweet 16 Poll organized by the Football Writers Association of America and the National Football Foundation. Here is my top four: 1. Ohio State. Doesn\u2019t matter who is playing quarterback as long as Braxton Miller is playing somewhere. 2. Alabama. Looked strong in an opening 35-17 victory over Wisconsin. 3. Baylor. Beat Southern Methodist by 35 points, showing the Bears will play with a chip on their shoulder all season. 4. Texas Christian. So-so opening victory at Minnesota, but the Horned Frogs will only get better. Contact Mark Anderson at manderson@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2914. Follow him on Twitter: @markanderson65.
