SABMiller, the maker of Peroni and Grolsch, is said to be playing hardball with AB InBev over price, but is not unreceptive to a deal. \n  \nAB InBev and SABMiller declined to comment on the report. \n\nEarlier this month, AB InBev, brewer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and more than 200 other brands, approached SABMiller about a takeover that would form a colossus producing a third of the world's beer. A merged group would have a market value of around $275 billion, and would combine AB InBev's dominance of Latin America with SABMiller's of Africa, both fast-growing markets, as well as their breweries in Asia.
