However, the two most common challenges listed were limited subscriptions to clinical information services by hospitals or healthcare facilities and issues with Wi-Fi or network access.\n\nPoint of care where clinical information is used \n\nThe top reason cited for the search of clinical information was to \"stay abreast of latest developments in their field,\" followed by \"reference during treatment and surgery.\" Physicians also use online search to plan treatment therapy, diagnostic tests, ensure best care is delivered at the lowest cost, establish clinical standards of patient care, and to prepare for a patient interaction. The clinical specialties most reliant on search include cardiology, internal medicine, general surgery, neurology and oncology.\n\nSurvey results also showed that 58 percent of physicians prefer to access information from their computers while 14 percent still refer to printed sources of information. One in three physicians said they use a mobile device at the point of care, especially during patient consultation or treatment.\n\n\"Findings from this survey reveal that, regardless of which country and background doctors and healthcare professionals come from, their objectives and priorities with regards to clinical search is very much the same - trusted content and quick access to the most recent information,\" said Pete Read \n\nReferences \n\nAbout the survey \n\nThe Clinical Search - An understanding of healthcare professionals' attitudes, needs and challenges survey was conducted with 210 doctors and healthcare professionals from seven countries in Asia-Pacific \n\nAbout ClinicalKey \n\nClinicalKey provides evidence-based clinical answers drawn from the single largest body of clinical content available, including 600+ journals, 1,100+ books, drug information, guidelines, patient education and Medline.
