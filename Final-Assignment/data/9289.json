They were formed when the need arose. But they consisted of experts from our mechanical department. But the error occurred and we promise it won't happen again,\" said Nyongesa.\n\nMakarani, who spoke to the Star after the grilling, blamed the county for appointing inexperienced personnel in the tender committee.\n\n\"Why did they appoint personnel who are not knowledgeable in the committee?\" said Makarani.\n\nHe took issue with the failure by the county managers to give crucial documents to auditors in time.\n\nFinance executive Hazel Koitaba, who also appeared before the committee, apologised for failing to hand over crucial documents to auditors.", "source": "AllAfrica.com"}
