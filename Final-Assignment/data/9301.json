Designed by Margaret Calvert & Jock Kinneir their system has became a role model for modern signage all over the world. \u00a0Curated beautifully by 'Made North', the 'Design Museum' will play host for '50 Years of British Road Signs', where fifty current interpretations of this ubiquitous object will be on show by various leading (I know!) designers & artists. \u00a0Running from September 19th through to 25th October the exhibition is free as part of the 'London Design Festival' .. just make sure you know how to get there yeah..\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both signs are silkscreen prints on to an Aluminium Roadsign / 4 colour print. Made North's theme of 'North & South' was the perfect platform to silkscreen pop images of Liverpool's Fab Four & London's The Rolling Stones. \u00a0Apparently at the time you were either one way or the other .. my Mum being a scouser was strictly Beatles !", "source": "'Original Screenprint'"}
