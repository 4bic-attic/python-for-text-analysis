The overestimate is being attributed to double counting of vehicles in previous estimates as well as mistaken inclusion of some vehicles that were sold outside the U.S.\n\nPer Takata, nearly 33.8 million of its airbag inflators sold globally are defective. 11 automakers, including the likes of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. HMC , BMW, Toyota Motor Corporation TM , General Motors Co. GM , Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. NSANY , Ford Motor Co. F , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. FCAU and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., have been affected by the malfunctioning airbag inflators. Notably, Honda has been impacted the most by the defect.\n\nThe defective airbags can explode, shooting metal fragments and injuring passengers, in case of a car crash. There have been at least 8 fatalities and 100 injuries globally due to these faulty airbags. Around 4.4 million inflators have already been replaced in the U.S. However, some of these have only been repaired with the help of a temporary solution and may further require a replacement.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
