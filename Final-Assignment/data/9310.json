He scores the penalty and he had other chances. \n\n'I think for tomorrow he is 100 per cent fit. Maybe after his injury he was not alright, especially against West Ham he was not 100 percent but he is now okay.' \n \nWhile Aguero will lead City's line at Tottenham, Pellegrini still has other injury woes. \n\nEliaquim Mangala, Gael Clichy, Fabian Delph, David Silva, Wilfried Bony, Pablo Zabaleta and Kelechi Iheanacho are all absent, testing the league's wealthiest squad to the full. \n\nThe City boss said: 'We have a lot of injured players with different injuries. Not just one reason. \n\n'That is why I say it is important to have a squad because you are going to win or lose the title by just one point or two points. Normally the difference is not more. \n   \nBut the Argentine (pictured celebrating with Raheem Sterling) was excellent in the midweek win at Sunderland\u00a0 \n   \nAguero had struggled with a knock against West Ham after this aggressive tackle from Scott Dann at Palace \n\n'That is why you must have a strong squad. That is why we played the game against Sunderland with 11 players injured and won. \n\n'We had 11 players injured against Sunderland so we played the only 11 players that can play. We don't have more players.' \n\nAt least City can welcome back skipper and central defender Vincent Kompany from injury tomorrow after their defence was exposed badly by the Hammers. \n\nPellegrini added: It is important for the team that Vincent has just recovered from his injury. \n\n'He is the captain and he started the season very well, not only as a defender, he scored three important goals also.'\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0", "source": "Mail Online UK"}
