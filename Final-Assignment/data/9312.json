The clamshell bonnet, on the other hand, features four ribs over the top surface to \u201cheighten the impression of strength.\u201d \n \n\n \nAt the rear, the clear lens tail lights also feature LED technology and C-shaped directional indicators, while the tailgate\u2019s cross beam design adds to the macho aesthetic. Finishing off the look are 21-inch six-spoke wheels \u2013 accented by the gold centres and blue brake callipers \u2013 that comprehensively fill up the large, hulking wheel arches. \n \nNeat practical touches integrated into the load bed include three longitudinal recesses for securing equipment, as well additional storage boxes to keep belongings away from prying eyes. Last but not least, cameras are fitted into the door mirrors; not for any form of blind spot monitoring, but \u2013 get this \u2013 \u201cto permit the filming of passing landscapes.\u201d \n \nUnder the bonnet, a twin-turbo diesel engine promises to be lighter than most equivalent oil burners and provide \u201coutstanding acceleration performance, plus class-topping fuel economy and low CO2 emissions.\u201d This is likely the YS23 2.3 litre dCi mill \u2013 taken from the Master van \u2013 that\u2019s also used in the NP300 Navara in Euro 5-compliant markets; there, it makes 188 hp at 3,750 rpm and 450 Nm from 1,500 to 2,500 rpm. \n                          \nThe post appeared first on Paul Tan's Automotive News . \n  \nRelated posts:  F45 BMW 225xe Active Tourer Plug-in Hybrid debuts  Mercedes-AMG C 63 S by Brabus \u2013 600 hp and 800 Nm  Suzuki Baleno \u2013 front pic of production hatch revealed  2016 Renault Megane \u2013 the IV to debut in Frankfurt  2016 smart fortwo cabrio revealed, debuts in Frankfurt  SPIED: 2016 Renault Megane gets new family face  Renault Kadjar \u2013 a fresh crossover for the C-segment  Renault to revamp lineup, new Laguna touted  \u2013 report  Renault reveals new \u201cPOWERFUL\u201d twin-charged, two-stroke two-cylinder diesel engine for the future  New hardcore Renault Megane RS variant teased", "source": "TechAttack"}
