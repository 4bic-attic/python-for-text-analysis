TRICK 3D is an award-winning, immersive media studio rooted in 3D film production, virtual world creation, character animation and stereoscopic 3D. At TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015, the company will debut the beta version of its flagship VR offering, Floorplan Revolution, for use in architecture and real estate sectors. \n\nTRICK 3D will be demonstrating Floorplan Revolution on the exposition floor throughout the day, along with demos of VR material used for brand experiences and kids entertainment. Harnessing the studios deep capabilities in virtual world creation, the Floorplan Revolution application will enable users to generate virtual spaces, create photo-realistic walkthroughs of floor plans and customize features, such as flooring, windows and interiors all without a physical space as the application will only require a 2D floor plan. TRICK 3D is on schedule to have the application fully launched and available for subscription purchase before the end of 2015. \n\nVirtual reality opens up great opportunities for all industries. With more than 10 years of experience creating virtual worlds, TRICK 3D is extremely well-positioned to be a leader in providing realistic and accessible VR solutions, said TRICK 3D Founder Chad Eikhoff. Floorplan Revolution Solves the age-old problem of not being able to visualize a floor plan, and itll be accessible on all devices, including VR. \n\nTRICK 3Ds VR debut at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 comes on the heels of the launch of its latest VR engagement with aviation giant, Delta Air Lines. TRICK 3D developed and executed Delta Air Lines-branded VR installations that enabled a life-like boarding and aircraft walkthrough experience for customers. The airline used this VR pop-up experience in Delta SkyClubs in airports throughout the United States. TRICK 3D also recently extended its filmmaking capabilities by opening the Southeasts only fully-capable virtual studio equipped with motion capture, a virtual camera system and the proprietary TRICKCam that allows actors to be tracked in real-time in VR environments. \n\nFilmmakers and Fortune 100 customers choose to do business with us, because we deliver more creative and realistic experiences than most other VR studios can offer, said TRICK 3D Executive Producer, Fatimah Abdullah. Our experience as filmmakers gives our team members the ability to leverage truly inventive and compelling story-telling techniques, which give us a leg up over our competition. \n\nTo schedule a one-on-one meeting or demo with the TRICK 3D creative team at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015, contact stacy(at)clearvoicepr(dot)com. \n\nABOUT TRICK 3D \n\nTRICK 3D is an immersive media studio specializing in the creation of virtual worlds through 3D animation and virtual reality (VR).
