Like a freight train slowly gathering speed and gaining momentum...\nToo many of my friends have looked at me with blank expressions on their faces this past week, exclaiming \"Via What?!\" Therefore,\u00a0I have decided that since I am going to get the exercise anyway, I could just as well spend some energy in creating a guide book or two and a documentary DVD.\u00a0\nThanks for all the support, visits and donations. Small change really makes a big difference.", "source": "Indiegogo: Announcements"}
