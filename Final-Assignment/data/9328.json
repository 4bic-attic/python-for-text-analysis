A quick look at these two entries. \n \n\u201cThe Player\u201d \n\nPremiere: 10 p.m. Thursday \n\nPremise: Crime becomes a Las Vegas game for the fabulously wealthy. The mysterious Mr. Johnson (Wesley Snipes) oversees the game with help from dealer Cassandra (Charity Wakefield). The gamblers bet on whether the Player, Alex Kane (Philip Winchester), can avert crimes while being put through hair-raising challenges. \n\nWhat\u2019s good: Winchester tackles the physical role with ease; he pulled off a similar feat in \u201cStrike Back.\u201d Snipes brings amusing flourishes to his melodramatic dialogue. \n  \nWhat\u2019s not so good: Kane is thrust into the game after suffering a heartrending loss. But \u201cThe Player\u201d isn\u2019t interested in lingering over personal anguish and quickly shifts to shootouts and chases by foot, car and motorcycle. Alex is appalled that the game gambles with lives, yet he plays in hopes of doing good.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThe bottom line: The premise is repugnant, and the execution is preposterous. Someone close to Alex tells him: \u201cWe are what we do. Do good, you are good.\u201d \u201cThe Player\u201d is not good and wastes Winchester. \u00a0 \n\n\u201cHeroes Reborn\u201d \n\nPremiere: A two-hour 8 p.m. Thursday \n\nPremise: An extension of the drama that ran from 2006 to 2010 on NBC. That sprawling show about everyday people with superhero powers had a rousing start, then went into a disheartening decline. \n \nWhat\u2019s good: The production values and special effects supply some oomph. \n\nWhat\u2019s not so good: This grueling attempt to please fans starts with a Sept. 11-style disaster, and more horrific violence follows with alarming regularity. \u201cReborn\u201d shifts to animation for some of the most graphic mayhem. The villains are brutal, not fun. The new heroes aren\u2019t as compelling as those in the original series. \n\nThe bottom line: If you didn\u2019t watch \u201cHeroes,\u201d there\u2019s no point in trying this series. If you loved \u201cHeroes,\u201d this is a stinging disappointment. It is sad that NBC is repeating itself, and doing it so badly. \n Copyright \u00a9 2015, Orlando Sentinel", "source": "Orlando Sentinel"}
