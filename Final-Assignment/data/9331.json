Steuben County\u2019s Hornell also won 51 in a row, with that streak ending in the 2012 Class C state championship game. Massena\u2019s 55-game unbeaten streak, which included a tie, ended in 1957. M-E has the third-longest active winning streak in the nation. \n\n\u201cWe all know this is a big one, and we\u2019ve talked about it with the team because we want them to understand what\u2019s at stake so that they can appreciate it. I think that\u2019s an important part of all this,\u201d said M-E head coach Matt Gallagher. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s our next game and so we\u2019re going to treat it as the most important one. We\u2019ve always done that.\u201d \n\nCorning\u2019s roster has a much different look than last year, with a bunch of seniors from a 9-2 season lost to graduation. M-E has returned to Class A after winning three straight Class B state titles after capturing the Class A crown in 2011. \n\nGallagher is expecting the Hawks to come prepared. \n\n\u201cThey know what\u2019s at stake, too, I\u2019m sure, so that\u2019ll bring a little added something on their part as well,\u201d he said. \n\nThe Hawks have another difficult road game in Week 2 in Syracuse against Henninger. Last year Henninger was a 52-16 winner over Corning in the Class AA state quarterfinals. \n\nWatkins Glen/Odessa-Montour\u2019s combined team also gets started on the road, with the Seneca Indians taking on Owego Free Academy on Friday night. The programs merged in the winter after Odessa-Montour was unable to finish the 2014 season because of a lack of players. \n\nAnother large-school showdown is set for Ty Cobb Stadium, with Elmira High School taking on defending Section 4 Class A champion Union-Endicott. The Express won the Division 1 title last year in the Section 4 Football Conference and finished with a 7-3 record. \n\nFormer Elmira Notre Dame football standout Mike Bennett will bring his Thomas A. Edison Spartans to Southport to take on the his alma mater. Notre Dame head coach Mike D\u2019Aloisio has guided the Crusaders to 217 wins, which ranks 27th in New York state history, as he gets set for his 34th season leading the team. \n\nWaverly will also be home Friday, with the Wolverines taking on Johnson City. Waverly, coming off a 5-3 season, has made the move from Class C to Class B this season. \n\nAt 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Horseheads will host Fowler of Section 3. The Blue Raiders have another Section 3 opponent in Week 2, with a road game against Auburn on Sept. 11. \n\nReporter Kevin Stevens contributed to this report. \n\nWeek 1 Schedule \n\nFriday (all games at 7 p.m.) \n\nElmira at Union-Endicott \n\nEdison at Elmira Notre Dame \n\nCorning at Maine-Endwell \n\nWatkins Glen/Odessa-Montour at Owego \n\nJohnson City at Waverly \n\nSaturday \n\nFowler at Horseheads, 1:30 \n\nRead or Share this story: http://stargaz.tt/1UvtdMC", "source": "Star-Gazette"}
