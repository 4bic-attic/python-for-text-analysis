All this and more this week in TV. \n\nThe cable platform Foxtel has secured the rights to two new key Warner Bros series from the US. Supergirl and DC Legends of Tomorrow will both launch on Foxtel, joining the platform's existing Warner Bros/DC Comics properties, The Flash and Arrow. Foxtel will air both immediately after their US launch. Supergirl is expected to launch as part of the US autumn season later this year; DC Legends is expected in early 2016. Both programs were major launches at this year's Comic-Con in San Diego.\n\nThe Project's Carrie Bickmore is to host the annual Australians in Film Awards, which will be held in Los Angeles in October. Bickmore is a former winner of the TV Week Gold Logie Award.

BBC2 has commissioned six 30-minute episodes of the series from 7Wonder. 7Wonder's Alan Holland said the series \"aims to be hugely credible ... whilst also being full of mischief\".\n\nThe streaming platform Presto has commissioned a series of interstitial shorts from writer/director Matilda Brown. The series, Let's Talk About, will guest star Brown's father, actor Bryan Brown. The series of 10 three-minute episodes is about \"being up the duff in a relationship that's only just begun\".
