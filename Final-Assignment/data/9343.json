Something that will make them think every day. \nCheck it out: \n \nWhen graduates of West Point\u2019s Class of 2016 go into their years of service as officers of the Army, they will be wearing something no other cadets have worn before \u2014 class rings that include steel from the World Trade Center. \n \nIt hasn\u2019t received mention in the press. But it was movingly noted Friday in the introduction of the commandant of cadets, Brig. Gen. John Thomson III, at the military academy\u2019s annual ring memorial ceremony. \n \nWhat a cure for the cynicism of a cynical age. It\u2019s at the ring ceremony that seniors \u2014 known as \u201cfirsties\u201d \u2014 get their rings, which become a physical link between future officers and the West Point graduates who went before. \n \nThe ceremony takes place at one of the most beautiful places in America \u2014 Trophy Point. The trophies, which are cannons captured in 1812 and other wars, look out over a slope giving north into the Hudson River. \n \nClass of 2016 cadets were marched \u2014 to a cadence set by trumpets, pipes and drums \u2014 onto this slope. They passed Stanford White\u2019s famous battle monument, topped with a statue of \u201cFame.\u201d \n \nThe Army knows how to do ceremonies like few other American institutions. The cadets are dressed in a uniform called India Whites, worn only by West Point cadets.", "source": "Conservative Byte"}
