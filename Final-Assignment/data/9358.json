Gavito. \n \nLast weekend, some 20,000 refugees entered Bavaria on more than 100 trains after crossing through Hungary and Austria. \n \nCSU vice president Hans-Peter Friedrich earlier called Merkel\u2019s decision \u201can unprecedented political error\u201d that would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d, according to the Passauer Neue Presse daily. \n \n\u201cWe have lost control,\u201d he said, warning that it was \u201ccompletely irresponsible to allow thousands of people to enter without controlling and registering them, and one can\u2019t really estimate how many IS fighters or Islamists are among them.\u201d \n \nThomas Kreuzer, chairman of the CSU in the Bavarian parliament, said the influx was threatening to become permanent and \u201cexceed the reception and integration capacity of our country,\u201d the party statement said. \n \n? 2015 AFP", "source": "MauritaniaVox.com"}
