But we are hopeful he's ok.\" \n\nJohnson failed to finish the last game against West Brom and Hughes disclosed today: \"He's got a little bit of an issue with his groin which needs to settle down over the next 24 hours.\" \n\nHughes added that Bojan is likely to take his place on the bench again as he eyes up his full-time return from that cruciate knee ligament injury. \n\nHe's very close,\" Hughes admitted. \"He's had a couple of weeks more training and is very much in my thoughts.\"", "source": "The Sentinel"}
