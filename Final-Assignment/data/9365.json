But he says he moved up his timetable as unrest among conservatives threatened the House.\n\nHe told reporters at a news conference it has been an honor to serve in the House for 25 years and as its top leader. He says California congressman Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 House Republican, would \"make an excellent speaker.\"\n\nRep. John Mica said earlier Friday that Boehner \"just does not want to become the issue. Some people have tried to make him the issue both in Congress and outside.\"\n\nBoehner took over the speakership in January 2011.\n\n(", "source": "WTHR"}
