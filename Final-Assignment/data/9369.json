The Capital has seen a surge in the number of cases and deaths caused by dengue this year. \n\nNorth Delhi Municipal Corporation Standing Committee chairperson Mohan Bhardwaj said while he welcomed the audit announcement, it shouldn\u2019t be limited to the authorities\u2019 preparedness. \n\n\u201cI suggest the CAG also look into the withholding of around Rs.700 crore as per the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations, besides the allocated funds for the anti-vector borne diseases operations in this fiscal,\u201d said Mr. Bhardwaj. \n\nHe said the government\u2019s actions had resulted in a shortage of funds to fight dengue.
