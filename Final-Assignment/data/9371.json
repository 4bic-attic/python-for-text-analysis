I told him rights. It\u2019s just something \u2026 he doesn\u2019t know who I am, so he wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity to watch any fight tape of me. Whereas I\u2019m very familiar with him. Just a cordial thing.\u201d \n \nHere\u2019s how the scrap went: \n [embedded content]  \nOddly enough, Riley had to leave the game after the first-period fight, as\u00a0he wasn\u2019t on the Flames\u2019 official lineup. \n   \nWell at least my mom can't get mad at me this time for getting kicked out of a game #funwhileitlasted \n \n\u2014 Blair Riley (@Briles25) September 26, 2015 \n \n \nRiley has since been assigned to AHL Stockton. \n       \nThe optimism surrounding Buffalo\u2019s upcoming campaign took a hit on Monday, as head coach Dan Bylsma announced that veteran defensemen Josh Gorges and Zach Bogosian are \u201c week-to-week \u201d with their respective injures. \n \nGorges\u2019 ailment is of the lower-body variety, while the club didn\u2019t disclose which half of Bogosian\u2019s body is hurt. Regardless, losing both is a pretty significant blow. \n \nGorges, one of the club\u2019s alternate captains, averaged 22:22 TOI per night last year while Bogosian led all defensemen at 26:39. \n \nWithout those two in the lineup, Buffalo would be left to fill out the blueline with the likes of Rasmus Ristolainen , Cody Franson, Mike Weber , Mark Pysyk , Jake McCabe, Matt Donovan and Carlo Colaiacovo . \n \nThankfully for the Sabres, there\u2019s still time until their regular season gets underway against Ottawa on Oct. 8 \u2014 10 days, to be specific. That could be enough time for both Gorges and Bogosian to get healthy. \n       \nMark Fraser is expected to catch on with the Ottawa Senators. \n \nThe 28-year-old defenseman was released today from his tryout with\u00a0the Leafs, but will reportedly sign a two-way contract with the Sens. \n \nAccording to the Ottawa Sun\u2019s Bruce Garrioch , Fraser\u2019s deal will be worth $800,000 in the NHL and $125,000 in the AHL. \n \nThe Sens moved on Fraser after\u00a0d-man prospect Mikael Wikstrand returned home to Sweden . \n \nFraser played 34 games for the Devils in 2014-15, registering four assists while logging an average of 16:17 in ice time.", "source": "NBC Sports"}
