Employers need to be confident that when they locate in Glasgow they are coming to a city with huge ambitions and a pool of talented people to help them grow. \n \nOur young people are key to that, so the Green Jobs Fair is a major part of a broader approach to developing a skills pipeline in support of green jobs growth for the city. \n \nWe want to develop a \u2018green print\u2019 for a more sustainable economy and to help our young people to get decently paid jobs with good future career prospects. Indeed, we look to create nothing less than a re-industrialisation of Glasgow through the low carbon and digital sectors.\u201d", "source": "Government Opportunities"}
