Sometimes, I am off having the time of my life. That is not the case as of late. It\u2019s been a pretty bad couple of months. After the memorial, I just went dark and deep. I have been, and remain very depressed and slightly suicidal. Being slightly suicidal is like being a little pregnant. I\u2019ve had some pretty dark moments. I now know what cold metal tastes like. I couldn\u2019t do that to Mr. Y. He would hate me forever if he walked into his house and found me like that. I know. I\u2019m pretty fucked up. I wonder where did I go? That woman who was so tied to the Universe and creation? Where is she and how do I connect with her again? I want to talk to my emotional twin. I miss her. I miss feeling her. I miss laughing with her. I miss looking beyond our differences. This is all for now.", "source": "Version 2.0"}
