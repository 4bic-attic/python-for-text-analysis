It\u2019s not always that fun to play in soaking, pouring conditions, but I\u2019m very happy with the way our guys came out in the second half and continued to play hard and competed throughout the game.\u201d\n\nRunning back Caleb Squires led the way for the Patriots, racking up 173 yards and three touchdowns on 20 carries, adding a two-point conversion to put ACA up 21-0 before halftime.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent football player,\u201d Smelley said. \u201cHe was hurt last year so I\u2019m just proud of him. I\u2019m glad to see him getting on the field this year. He\u2019s one of our team leaders and hopefully we\u2019ll continue to see him run throughout the season like that.\u201d \n\nThe job of Squires and the rest of the offense was made easier by the field position gained after Hale County turnovers. The Wildcats turned the ball over five times, including one fumble in the end zone and one fumbled kickoff. ACA scored touchdowns on three of the five ensuing drives. \n\n\u201cWe just got to go back to work,\u201d Hale County coach Joe Nettles said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019re 2-2, the undefeated season is the only thing we\u2019ve lost so far. We don\u2019t have our undefeated season, but we still have the playoffs, and that\u2019s what we want to do: get in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nAmerican Christian (3-0, 2-0 in 3A region 4) will host Greene County next week. Hale County (2-2, 0-2) will travel to Aliceville.", "source": "Tuscaloosa News"}
