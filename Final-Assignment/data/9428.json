It\u2019s a great environment.\u201d \n\nThe West Suburban Silver game was originally scheduled Sept. 18 but was postponed to noon the next day because of weather. \n\nMuhammad, a senior, opened the scoring for the visitors, getting behind the Dukes\u2019 defense and hauling in a 43-yard touchdown pass from Michael Sessa less than five minutes into the game. He added a 34-yard score late in the first half after York had found the end zone for the first time. \n\n\u201cThose were routes I run maybe five or 10 times each practice,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten pretty good at them and it\u2019s showing up.\u201d \n\nSessa also found Matt Cherry for a 6-yard score as Hinsdale Central built a 24-0 first-quarter advantage. Brady Garber booted a 42-yard field goal and the defense got into the act, forcing three turnovers, one of which was returned 13 yards for a score by Luke Lagor. \n\n\u201cPlaying York is always a big week for us,\u201d Lagor said. \u201cWe were ready to go [Sept. 18] and even coming here [Sept. 19]. It was a big day for us. \n\n\u201cAll of us did our jobs. We executed and fed off each other\u2019s energy and ended up doing a good job.\u201d \n\nJosh Bean\u2019s 3-yard touchdown run gave the Red Devils a 38-7 advantage at the intermission. \n\nMichael Porter recovered a fumble and Frank Saltiel picked off a pass in the first half. Alex Fey added a pick in the fourth quarter and Mark Cybor and Max Gregor recorded sacks on York\u2019s final possession of the game. \n\n\u201cGoing against Michael Sessa [in practice], I think he is one of the best quarterbacks in the state,\u201d Saltiel said. \u201cFacing him every day in practice, that makes us better and it really prepares us every week. This was the first team that has thrown a lot [against us].\u201d \n\nIn the second half, Sessa connected again with Cherry for a 19-yard score and Christian Bobak found the end zone on an 18-yard run. The running back finished with 139 yards on 16 carries. \n \nSessa was 11-of-17 for 185 yards and Bean was 6-of-8 for 92 yards. \n\n\u2013 \n\nWeek 5 matchup \n\nWho: Proviso West at Hinsdale Central \n\nWhen: Noon Sept. 26 \n\nWhere: 5500 Grant St., Hinsdale \n\nRecords: Proviso 0-4 (0-2 West Suburban Silver), Central 4-0 (2-0) \n\nOutlook: For homecoming, the Red Devils host a Proviso West team that hasn\u2019t scored since a Week 2 game against Willowbrook. This would appear to be a lopsided contest, but Central can\u2019t afford to look ahead to a big Week 6 game against Glenba", "source": "MySuburbanLife.com"}
