He has little time to attend to problems of the farming community. The Congress which has been rejected by people of Bengaluru is trying to capture power through the back door,\u201d he said. \n\nDwelling at length on drought situation in Hyderabad Karnataka region, Mr Yeddyurappa regretted that none of the ministers concerned had bothered to visit to ascertain the situation. The state government was in deep slumber and all its ministers were camping only in Bengaluru. \u00a0 \n\nWhile calling upon the Chief Minister to convene a joint session of legislature to discuss the drought situation before September 11, Mr Yeddyurappa appealed to him to come to the rescue of farmers by announcing waiver of farmers\u2019 loans of both cooperative societies as well as public sector banks. \n\nHe charged the state government with failing to comply with the Centre\u2019s direction to submit a detailed report on farmers\u2019 suicide in Karnataka. On the contrary the state government was trying to hush up the cases of farmers\u2019 suicide. \n\nThe Union government had released Rs 274 crores from the calamity relief fund, but the state failed to provide ex-gratia to the kin of farmers who have committed suicide, he said. \n\nCM failed in handling drought situation: Prahlad Joshi \n\nState BJP president, Prahlad Joshi, on Friday lambasted CM Siddaramaiah for failing to handle the drought situation in State.
