If you leave the wine in your cart for even a few minutes it might have already sold out as our stock quantity is removed when you submit the order in final, not when you add it to your cart! \n \nYou will get two emails from us with regards to your order. The first email from us only confirms that we received your order. The second email will confirm that we have enough wine to fill your order. Due to the high volume of sales there are times when the wine has sold out, but our system is still updating and shows it as available. We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience and will do what we can to fill your order! \n \nThanks to your feedback we might bring back some of Cinderella Wine\u2019s popular previous offers. If a wine makes another appearance here, this newer offer will always be slightly higher than the original one. Offers that are on the site on Friday through Sunday will be shipped on Monday. \n \nBest Price on Web is determined by Wine-Searcher prices as of yesterday : Wine Library sells this for our sale price of $9.99. There are 3 stores that sell this for $11.96 to $15.99. Please note, we are not taking virtual inventory into account. \n \nFree shipping on orders of 6 bottles or more!", "source": "Cinderella Wine"}
