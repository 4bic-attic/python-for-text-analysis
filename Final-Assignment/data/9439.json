We have seen actually in the polls and in elections, the rise of eurosceptic and anti-immigrant parties in a number of countries: from Denmark to Sweden,\u201d said Giovanni Grevi, director of the Spanish think-tank FRIDE . \n \n\u201cWe have in France, the Front National. We have a debate on that in Italy. We have a strong debate in the UK. It is going to be very, very difficult.\u201d \n \nAnother key question is how to deter migrants relocated to another country from eventually moving to their preferred destination. \n \nOfficials at the European Commission say those relocated will only have the legal right to remain in the country where they have been afforded international protection. \n \nBut the EU\u2019s visa-free, travel zone makes moving across borders very easy as there are no mandatory checks. \n \nEU interior ministers will discuss the proposal at a meeting in Brussels next week. \n \nTo analyse the State of the Union address, euronews\u2019 Margherita Sforza \nspoke with Sophia in\u2019t Veld, Vice Chair of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament. \n \nMS, euronews: What do you think of Mr Juncker\u2019s  proposal to relocate and distribution 160.000 thousands asylum seekers, among member states. Is it ambitious enough? \n \nSophia in\u2019t Veld, Dutch Liberal MEP : \n\u201cI think it\u2019s ambitious, whether it will be enough, it remains to be seen because we don\u2019t know how many more people want to come to Europe, but it is definitively a step in the right direction. What it needs now is the support of the national governments that has been completely absent so far. I have found quite shocking that government leaders have refused to meet in an emergency summit.\u201d \n \nen: Can we guarantee the security of the European citizens facing this influx of migrants and refugees? \n \nSophia in\u2019t Veld: \u201cSure. There are probably criminals, bad people and potential terrorists among the refugees, but you know what: we have them in Europe as well, homegrown, because let\u2019s not forget that the same week-end where German people were given a very warm welcome to refugees for example at Munich station, there were also neo-Nazis burning down asylum seeker reception centers. There are always threats in society.\u201d \n \nen: \u201cWe are talking about a new proposal for a legal system of migration. What do you expect from this Commission? \u201c \n \nSophia in\u2019t Veld: \u201cThere are many asylum seekers from countries within the western Balkans but also some African countries for example; some people aren\u2019t fleeing a war but they want to come here and work, which is perfectly legitimate, but they don\u2019t have any real legal avenues at their disposal. So let\u2019s create those avenues so that we don\u2019t clog up the asylum system and we give shelters to those who need; but we can also give to people who want to come here and work and contribute to society, the means to do so.\u201d \n \nen: \u201cWhat was missing in your opinion from President Juncker\u2019s speech?\u201d \n \nSophia in\u2019t Veld: \u201cI think what it was missing, was nothing in the words of Mr Juncker, what it was missing was the presence of member states and Mr Tusk (European Council President), because it\u2019s the member states who have agreed on a common asylum system already back in 1999, (ed: Tampere summit), and they have simply not delivered. What is missing here is the courage and the leadership of the national leaders. And the fact that there is not a proper asylum and refugee policy in place today is the result of ten years of anti-EU and anti-migration sentiments. It is not an accident the little boy washed up on the shore of Turkey. It was not an accident, it is the result of policy choices.\u201d \n  \nJavaScript is required in order to view this article\u2019s accompanying video", "source": "EuroNews"}
