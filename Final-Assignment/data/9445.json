I remember sitting around, listening to\u00a0Mr. Mister\u2019s \u201cBroken Wings\u201d and watching\u00a0 The A-Team , in between games of Zelda\u00a0 on my Nintendo Entertainment Center. I can also remember paying 85 cents for a gallon of gas and the night Mike Tyson became\u00a0the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Man, what a year.\u00a0( Note: I don\u2019t remember any of that because I\u2019m not old enough. ) \n \n1986 is also the last time Kentucky beat Florida in football, back when Bill Ransdell was under center for the Wildcats. In that \u201986 meeting with the Gators, a 10-3 victory for UK, Ransdell completed 20 of his 23 passes, setting an SEC single-game record for completion percentage. The record stood until 1998. \n \nSo why are we dialing back the clock this morning, you ask? \n \nTo say this: I\u2019m so over 1986 and the 28-game losing streak to Florida. Tomorrow, it ends. Tomorrow, Kentucky is\u00a0Daniel and Florida is\u00a0Chozen Toguchi, fighting in that old temple. Start spinning\u00a0the\u00a0pellet drums, Mr. Miyagi. Live or die. (Another 1986 reference.) \n \nNow back to 2015\u2026 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhat about that Louisville loss last night? \n \nI really hate that for the Cardinals. You know me, I\u2019m a big UofL fan and it just sickens me to see when they\u2019re down like this, especially with such a nice guy like Bobby Petrino working so hard to coach them up. \n \nHowever, I\u2019m not giving up on them yet. With Samford coming to town next week, I\u2019m confident the Cards can turn this thing around and get to 1-3 before going on the road at NC State and Florida State. \n \nUofL QB Lamar Jackson\u2019s Twitter account was \u201chacked.\u201d \n \n\n \nAs @theSkinny81 points out on Twitter, Louisville leads the nation in hacked Twitter accounts. \n \nCheck out this throwback\u00a0shot of John Calipari. \n \n\n \nIt comes from Five-Star Basketball, where he got his start in the coaching game. \n \nKentucky plays Florida tomorrow, FYI. \n \nI will have plenty of pre-Florida stuff on the website throughout the day, so don\u2019t you go anywhere. We\u2019re 24 hours away from first tailgate beer. \n \nMKG Security stops Jeremy Lin at Time Warner Cable Arena. \n \n\n \nLin, Kidd-Gilchrist\u2019s new teammate in Charlotte, should know by now: MKG Security is always on guard, 24-7. \n \n\n \nMiles Bridges is ready for his official visit. \n \nThe five-star prospect will arrive on campus later today for his official visit to Kentucky. He tweeted his excitement late last night: \n \nCan't wait for my visit this weekend #BBN what's good!! \n \n\u2014 Miles Bridges (@MilesBridges01) September 18, 2015 \n \n\n \nThe plan is to announce between Kentucky, Michigan State and Indiana on October 3. \n \nIndiana\u2026 Ha! \n \nKentucky Sports Radio radio is at McDonald\u2019s in Frankfort today. \n \nThat\u2019s the location at 102 Limestone Lane. Get in there. \n \n\u00a0", "source": "Kentucky Sports Radio"}
