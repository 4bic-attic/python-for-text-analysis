People are so accustomed to thinking of the body as an instrument or a tool of the mind that they accept its relative deadness as a normal state. \u2026what is important is how the body feels.\n- Alexander Lowen\nHi everyone,\n\nNext Saturday, September 26, 10a \u2013 noon, Living Ubuntu is hosting Intro to TRE \u2013 Fundraiser: Trauma Recovery for East African Refugees. Many of you are familiar with this method, created by Dr. David Berceli. For those of you that aren\u2019t, I want to encourage you to come give it a try. (See: What is TRE?)\n\nI first learned Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises (TRE) from Dr. Berceli back in 2004, and it is not an exaggeration to say it dramatically changed my life and the path I was pursuing. The story is too long for email, so if you want to hear it, we need to meet up for coffee ;)\n\nBy now I have had the privilege of teaching thousands of people, and countless times I have heard how it helped them sleep better. The list of additional benefits is long. For those who continue to practice it over time, stories of significant healing and a way of being able to enjoy living differently in their own skin are plentiful. Recently, I even heard a story about how it helped someone\u2019s tennis game :)\n\nI am very passionate about the wish for us all to have more access to compassion and live more embodied, healthy lives, so I could go on and on. Instead, I am just going to issue the invitation again \u2013 come give it a try and see how you feel.\n\nTo RSVP, send an email to: info@livingubuntu.org.\n\nBeyond personal benefit, 100% of this event\u2019s proceeds will support Trauma Recovery for East African Refugees in San Diego being able to continue their own TRE practice. So come help yourself, and help others at the same time.\n\nIf you can\u2019t attend, consider making a contribution: DONATE HERE.\n\nWe have lots of great stuff going on, so make sure to scroll down and check out the calendar below to see the upcoming events.\n\nThank you for being involved,\nBarbara English, LMFT, CBT, TRE Trainer\nFounder and Executive Director, Living Ubuntu\nlivingubuntu.org\n(949) 891-2005\n\n[Ubuntu] n.
