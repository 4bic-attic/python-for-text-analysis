Similarly, Griffith airport in the Riverina and Kilmore Gap had visibility as low as 250 metres. Low cloud and drizzle this morning at Adelaide reduced visibility to as low as 1500 metres around 8am, making driving conditions a little dicey. \n\nThe reason for the foggy conditions was the persistent southwesterly airflow drawing humid air across a broad area of the country. High pressure over the area aided in the fog development overnight as winds became light. \n\nGenerally high pressure is synonymous with fair weather, but with so much moisture being drawn up from the Southern Ocean, the high acts to trap the moisture near the surface. \n\nOver the next couple of nights the high is expected to shift further east over southeastern Australia. This will lead to more light winds overnight and continued trapping over moisture leading to extensive mist and fog in SA, TAS, VIC and inland NSW. As the high shifts east later in the week, warm and dry air will be drawn south, reducing the fog risk. \n\n- Weatherzone \n\n\u00a9 Weatherzone\r\n\t\t\t2015\r \n   More breaking news  \n ABC News \nSydney Morning Herald \nNational Nine News \nNews Limited", "source": "Weather Zone"}
