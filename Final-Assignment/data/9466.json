But through revamping her diet and taking up walking, Joyce lost over 20kg, and now wears the cute outfits she wasn\u2019t able to before. \n \nJoyce Faltermeier \n\n \nBefore: 90kg \nAfter: 67.8kg \nHeight: 1.75m \nTime required to reach current weight : 9 months \n The Gain  \n\u201cI\u2019ve been heavy my whole life,\u201d says Joyce, a primary school teacher. She blamed her genes, but realises now that her bad diet and lack of exercise didn\u2019t help. \u201cAt my heaviest, I\u2019d sit in front of the TV eating chocolates and biscuits.\u201d \n The Change  \nIn August 2010, Joyce, who\u2019d always wanted children, was warned by her GP that if she wanted a healthy pregnancy,\u00a0she had to slim down. She also found inspiration through her colleagues, who\u2019d joined Weigh- Less. Finally, she wanted to be\u00a0a good role model for the kids in her class. \u201cWe teach them about healthy choices, so I needed to practise what I preached.\u201d \n \n\n The Lifestyle  \nJoyce lost two kilos in her first week with Weigh-Less, thanks to her five daily servings of veg and three servings of fruit, plus her love for fish and chicken. \u201cI never let myself go hungry because that\u2019s when your sugar levels drop. Your body overcompensates when you don\u2019t feed it correctly and you pile on the weight,\u201d says Joyce.\u00a0As her dress size dropped, so Joyce\u2019s energy levels increased. Her outlet: walking. \u201cI love hiking; now I pull myself up rock faces without help.\u201d \n The Reward  \nWhen Joyce hit her target weight, she wore a dress \u2013 something she\u2019d always been too self-conscious to do. \u201cI love\u00a0that I have a waist,\u201d she says. \u201cI can even wear a belt. Every woman loves to have a waist!\u201d \n Joyce\u2019s Tips  \nQuench your thirst. \u201cWater is a natural appetite suppressant.\u201d \n \nThink slim. \u201cVisualising how you\u2019re going to look and feel will keep you motivated.\u201d \n \nPlan your chow. \u201cPrepare healthy meals the night before.
