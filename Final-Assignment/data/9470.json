View Gallery Beyonc\u00e9 And Jay Z's Cutest Family Moments Bridie Wilkins 7th September, 2015 Just one day after celebrating her 34th\u00a0birthday, Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0was back to doing what she does best \u2013 owning the stage. Yep, on Saturday Queen Bey gave a sell-out performance as the headliner of Philadelphia\u2019s Made in America festival. Obviously, it goes without saying that the set list including Crazy in Love, Bootylicious, Survivor, Drunk in Love and Say My Name made for one seriously amazing performance alone, but it is her outfits that have got us all talking. In total, Queen B changed outfit an impressive eight times, and they were all totally jaw-dropping. As well as a number of racy over-the-knee boots, the singer sported a bejewelled lingerie set, a metallic cut-out bodysuit and various glitzy fishnets. Bey also donned a custom-made swimsuit inspired by the basketball player James Harden, Khloe Kardashian\u2019s current boyfriend. Jay-Z \u00a0was spotted singing along to 1+1, and he wasn\u2019t the only one who stepped out to show his support. Former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate and longterm gal-pal Kelly Rowland joined the crowd and was even given a personal shout-out: \u201cShout-out to my girl Kelly, I love you!\u201d. Meanwhile, fans were surprised to see Nicki Minaj singing along to \u201cHalo\u201d offstage, rather than teaming up with B to perform \u201cFeeling Myself\u201d.

To complete the show, Bey treated the audience to a speech originally by MMA fighter Ronda Rousey on how to be \u201cfemininely badass.\u201d \u201cJust because my body was developed for a purpose other than f*cking millionaires doesn\u2019t mean its masculine\u201d, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s femininely badass as f*ck, because there\u2019s not a single muscle on my body that isn\u2019t for a purpose. Because I\u2019m not a do-nothing bitch.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 then added in her own words: \u201cA do-nothing bitch is the kind of person Rousey\u2019s mother taught her not to be. She\u2019s someone who just tries to be pretty and taken care of by somebody else.\u201d You go, Bey!
