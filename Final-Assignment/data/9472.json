For one thing, the juicery\u00a0is owned by the family behind the Herb Lyceum, a farm/herb garden/event space in Groton, and Beatnik\u2019s products\u2014including pre-bottled juices, made-to-order juices, and multi-day cleanses\u2014will use produce harvested from the grounds. \n\nPlus, aside from the usual cold pressed juices, Beatnik will be among the first establishments in Boston to serve Bulletproof Coffee, the trendy coffee drink made with grass-fed butter and \u201cBrain Octane Oil\u201d said to boost brain function, suppress appetite, and spur weight loss. The cafe will also have Nitro Coffee poured from a Guinness tap, kombucha, and cold brewed iced coffee. \n\nOpening Sept. 8 at 5 Cambridge Center, Cambridge; beatnikbeverage.com. \n\nYou May Also Like: \n\nRecipe: Healthy Vegan Lemon Cookies \n\nWhat\u2019s For Breakfast?
