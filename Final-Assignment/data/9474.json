Why was it that he did not attend any church in Igboland to celebrate the 16 years anniversary of MASSOB struggle to actualize Biafra?\u201d Madu asked. \n \nREAD ALSO: \u00a0Buhari\u2019s Appointments: MASSOB Issues Warning To Ohaneze \n \nHe then assured that Uwazurike will be probed because of the incident, as he recalled that many members of the group are still being detained in police cells. \n \nRecall that the Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase, recently ordered his men to clampdown on MASSOB or any other group inciting violence in the country. \n  \n Vote for this Article  Spread the word", "source": "AfricanSeer"}
