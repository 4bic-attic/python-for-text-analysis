FiberCare works by impregnating fibers with co-polymer resins in a mineral spirit base. This means dust and dirt can\u2019t get trapped within the fiber. Spills can be easily blotted up, dirt and grit can be more effectively removed by vacuuming or damp dusting, thereby, increasing fiber life. \nFiberCare can be applied to all fibers, new and old, even those that have been temporarily protected with mill level finishes such as Scotchguard or Teflon. FiberCare protects against both oil-base and water-base stains. \nCALL (214) 987-4111 FiberCare Dallas \u2013 Fabric Protection & Cleaning Services for Upholstery, Draperies, Rugs and Carpet.", "source": "Rich's Best of the Web"}
