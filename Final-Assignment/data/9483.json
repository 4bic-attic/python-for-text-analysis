Brabin said: \u201cIt feels like a defeat because Kidderminster don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve got back into the game. We can\u2019t believe we dropped two points after a very pleasing start.\u201d Fighting back the disappointment, Brabin took consolation from a performance which, in the first 70 minutes at least, represented a significant improvement on the recent defeats to Boreham Wood and Altrincham. Brabin said: \u201cWe started the game very well. We played some fantastic stuff in the first half-hour, good possession and creating chances and we went 2-0 up. \u201cAt the start of the second half we created some more chances and what we needed was to score a third goal. \u201cI thought Liam Hogan was outstanding coming back into the side but he tried to guide the ball out from a dangerous position rather than just relieve the pressure. It led to Kidderminster\u2019s first goal and they were back in the game.\u201d Brabin added: \u201cWe had some great chances today and didn\u2019t put them away and we seem to be getting punished for mistakes we make at the other end. But we feel we are not a million miles away.\u201d Brabin revealed that wing-back Adam Mekki was taken off at half-time with a hamstring injury. With striker James Norwood still under treatment, Brabin hasn\u2019t ruled out doing some business before the transfer window closes. theliverpoolecho Related : Tranmere Rovers FC, Get daily news by email Invalid e-mail Subscribe Thanks for subscribing!
