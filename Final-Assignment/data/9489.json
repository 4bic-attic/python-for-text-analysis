And he urged Commissioner Hogan to take steps to assist in developing a fully functioning dairy futures market in the EU. \n \nNFU livestock board chairman Charles Sercombe called on European farming organisations to demand a new task force on market transparency in the lamb sector. \n \nAnd on Monday NFU President Meurig Raymond will tell a UK Ministerial Delegation why action is needed quickly. \n \nMr Raymond said: \u201cBritish farmers from all sectors are calling on the UK Government to work with the European Commission to implement ten key measures to enable British farmers to better withstand market volatility. \n \n\u201cWe have already seen farmers demonstrating across England and Wales. Farming union Presidents, including myself, met Government ministers for talks at a summit in Westminster where Defra recognised that more needed to be done to back British farming during these extremely volatile times. \n   Promoted stories   \n\u201cNow, farmers need the Secretary of State to strongly stand up for British farming interests in Europe. \n \n\u201cWe need the European Commission to implement measures to ease cash flow difficulties and strengthen safety nets. \n \n\u201cWe need a long term approach in the food supply chain. In dairy this means contracts that allow farmers to plan for the future and lock in a milk price reflective of the cost of production. \n \n\u201cBritish farmers need the GSCOP and Groceries Code Adjudicator to stamp out unfair trading practices in the food supply chain. I want that same protection offered by other member states when British farmers trade with European retailers. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\u201cBritish shoppers tell us they want to see more British food on the shelves. \n \n\u201cWe urge UK ministers to work alongside their devolved and European colleagues to significantly strengthen country of origin labelling across all food lines.\u201d", "source": "Falmouth Packet"}
