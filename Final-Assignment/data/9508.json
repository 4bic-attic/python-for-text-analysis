Meservey was there to teach youth about junk drawer robotics. Children even got to create their own junk drawer robots. These \"Brush Bots\" as Meservey named them, were made from four junk drawer items: the head of a toothbrush, double sided tape, a small watch battery and a vibrating motor from a cell phone. A representative from the Donaldson Company in Chillicothe, Patrick Cypert, also spoke to the Power Clover kids about robotics, and how Donaldson\u2019s uses robotics to build air filters.", "source": "Constitution-Tribune"}
