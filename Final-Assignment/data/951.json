Messenger Photo by Joe Duty \n \nRhome police interviewed the driver, David Hubbard, 60, who was Grisamer\u2019s son. He told police he\u2019d picked his mother up from her home in New Mexico and was taking her to live with him in Fort Worth at the time of the accident. Police Chief Brandon Davis said Hubbard had been driving all night and had last talked to his mother when they were in the Amarillo area. \n \n\u201cAs he was traveling through the night, our assumption is she passed, and he didn\u2019t know it,\u201d Davis said. \n \nGrisamer\u2019s body was sent to the Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s office for an autopsy. \n \nDavis said no foul play is suspected at this time, and Hubbard was released after questioning. \n \nHubbard and the other female passenger, Sherri Bass, 59, in the Chevy station wagon were uninjured in the accident. Rhome Officer Bryan Pickler said Hubbard, traveling southbound on U.S. 81/287 and hauling a U-Haul trailer, reported being tapped from behind and pushed off the highway north of Rhome. Pickler said there were no tire marks to indicate this, and it was possible the driver fell asleep and drifted off the roadway. The U-Haul clipped a guardrail and detached from the station wagon, overturning in the wreck. \n \nRhome police and fire departments, EMS and the Department of Public Safety responded to the accident.", "source": "WCMessenger.com"}
