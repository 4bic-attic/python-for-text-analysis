She'd strip off her\u00a0bulky sweater to reveal her tight tank top. She couldn't wait to paint on the black eyeliner and slip into her favourite five-inch Louboutin stiletos and $300 Agent Provocateur lingerie \u2014 a gift from a client. \n \n\"I could feel the lights of Vegas waiting for me, reaching up into the sky to welcome me home. To welcome Kelly home. She wanted to come out in all her sexy, fun, manipulative glory,\" Favor Hamilton writes in her memoir \"Fast Girl: A Life Running From Madness.\" \n \n\"I could hardly stay in my seat. It felt so small and restrictive, and I felt so big and sparkly,\" she writes.\u00a0\"I'll show them how sexy I am, and that I have all the power. . . Get me off this plane. I am so ready to be the real me. I never was meant to be Suzy Favor Hamilton.\u00a0This is who I am.\"\u00a0 \n \nFor more than a year, Favor Hamilton led a double life. She\u00a0was\u00a0a household name in the U.S., a\u00a0seven-time national champion in the 1,500 metres, an American sweetheart, a loving wife and\u00a0mother.\u00a0 \n \nBut in Vegas, she was Kelly Lundy, one of the city's most sought-after\u00a0escorts, commanding $600 an hour. \n \nHer world came crashing down when The Smoking Gun broke the shocking story in December\u00a02012. She would be diagnosed soon after with bipolar disorder, the disease her brother Dan also battled before he committed suicide in 1999. \n \nIn \"Fast Girl,\" released this week, Favor Hamilton chronicled in unflinching detail her troubled life \u2014 the track career that took her to the 1992, '96 and 2000 Olympics, but\u00a0also caused crippling anxiety, her battles with food and body issues, her insatiable hunger for sex and danger, and her drive to become Vegas's top-ranked call girl. \n \nShe writes about a particular moment after meeting with a client. \n \n\"Everything around me seemed to pulse and throb, like the blood in my veins,\" she wrote.\u00a0\"My body was still glowing with pleasure. I wanted more. This is way better than winning a race, I thought. This is better than competing in the Olympics.\" \n \nThe past couple\u00a0weeks have been a blur for the 47-year-old. She\u00a0has been featured on ABC's \"20/20\" and been interviewed by Dr. Phil. \n \nThe\u00a0writing process was horrendously painful. There\u00a0were plenty of tears and times\u00a0\"I just wanted to call it all off,\" Favor Hamilton said in a phone interview Wednesday. \n \nThe book's release\u00a0has been like tearing open an old wound for\u00a0her and\u00a0her family, including husband Mark, whom she met as a freshman at the University of Wisconsin. The two have a\u00a0daughter, 10-year-old Kylie. \n \n\"I knew for family that this was going to be really, really tough,\" said Favor Hamilton.\u00a0\"Everybody is kind of dealing with it in their own way, and basically all I can do is sit back and hope that they will understand better and be able to also move on.\" \n \nIt's common for retired athletes to crave the high that comes with competing. Favor Hamilton said her disease, although she didn't realize it at the time,\u00a0multiplied that tenfold.\u00a0 \n \nAfter the Sydney Olympics, where she faked a fall to drop out of her race, she\u00a0seriously contemplated\u00a0suicide.\u00a0She was prescribed an antidepressant, which in a bipolar person can cause hypersexuality, she said. \n \n\"It was just the perfect storm,\" said Favor Hamilton. \n \nTwo months after starting the medication, Favour Hamilton\u00a0and her husband celebrated their wedding anniversary in Vegas by jumping out of plane and then having a threesome. They hired an escort. Both were her ideas. \n \n\"In my entire life I never could have jumped out of an airplane, ever. And here I am just flying high, can't wait to get on that plane and fall out into the air and fly,\" she said.\u00a0\"And then that night, we do\u00a0a threesome, something I was always curious about in my life but was never going to act on it. And it just all came so easily. \n \n\"I was alive. I was a changed person. Which is bizarre, how somebody can change that quickly. . .\" \n \nHad it not been prostitution, she would have found the high somewhere else, she said \u2014 drugs or alcohol probably.\u00a0By the time she was diagnosed, she'd already\u00a0taken a liking to the party drug ecstasy.\u00a0She was drinking regularly. \n \nThe\u00a0three\u00a0years since her story became public haven't been easy. Pain replaced numbness. That's\u00a0not\u00a0completely a bad thing, she said. \n \n\"I have so much emotion, I can start crying easily, especially when I get into talking about this and something triggers me,\" she said. \"I got emotion back. It's a sign of me getting healthy.\" \n \nShe wishes she had her brother Dan by her side. She knows he would be proud of where she is now. \n \n\"I know we would have been close, and\u00a0I know there would have been compassion because he was such a loving caring person,\" she said. \n \nShe said she's not ashamed of her behaviour. Now a sought-after public speaker, addressing eating disorders, mental illness and the struggles young athletes face, letting go of shame\u00a0weaves like a\u00a0common thread\u00a0through her words. \n \n\"Shame\u00a0is pointless, it holds you back,\" she said.\u00a0\"It's the disease. If you're focusing on the behaviour you're never going to get better.\" \n \nShe calls her long battle with her disease \"a gift.\" \n \n\"If I weren't bipolar, I wouldn't have found my voice to live my truth and tell my story, and I wouldn't be here now to help others to know that they are not alone.\" \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n\"Fast Girl: A Life Spent Running from Madness\" by Suzy Favor Hamilton\u00a0with Sarah Tomlinson, Dey Street Books,\u00a0292 pages, $33.50. \n \nLori Ewing, The Canadian Press \n \n\u00a92015 The Canadian Press", "source": "News Talk 980 CJME"}
