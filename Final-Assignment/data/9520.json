John Smith.\" Keene's reaction: \"The use of 'woman' and 'yearns' is so \u2026 gross. Shudder. \u2026 It overly sexualizes the film, and only positions Pocahontas in relation to her romantic options, not as a human being, you know, doing things.\" She also pointed out the \"colonial white supremacy embedded ... of course Pocahontas wouldn't be content with her backwards Native ways with her Native man \u2026 she yearns for something more. SPOILER ALERT: It's a white dude.\"", "source": "100.3 The Edge"}
