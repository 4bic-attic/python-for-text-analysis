The city needs to cut expenses and can\u2019t afford the $300,000 in personnel costs providing security at the fair would require. (Photo: Greg Jenson/The Clarion-Ledger) \n\nThe Mississippi State Fair will return Oct. 7, but Jackson Police Department won\u2019t be there. The reason: money. \n\nBut while money can make enemies of friends, there doesn\u2019t appear to be malice in the decision by JPD and the city to sit this one out. \n\nInstead, there\u2019s a potential $300,000 bill that Jackson would be left holding, the cost of paying JPD personnel the hours, including overtime, to assist the Hinds County Sheriff\u2019s Department \u2014 the agency responsible for the fairgrounds \u2014 with security of fairgoers in the capital city. \n\nIt\u2019s a tab the city has paid for years, a price written off because of the importance of the state fair and to encourage more Mississippians to venture into Jackson. \n\nIt\u2019s the cost of playing nice with the state, the owner of the property that hosts the fair and the estimated 700,000 visitors who will attend this year. \n\nYet while JPD is working with roughly 30 fewer officers than budgeted for the department \u2014 another tough budgetary decision \u2014 some have thrown stones at the city\u2019s decision to not offer the usual helping hand. \n\nThese are hard financial times for Jackson, and its city leaders, including Mayor Tony Yarber and JPD Chief Lee Vance, are making hard decisions, some quite unpopular, in order to stop the fiscal bleeding. \n\nAnd a city facing such decisions, including not fully staffing departments, potential furloughs for employees and cutting spending, can\u2019t continue giving away goodwill for free. \n\nToo often, Jackson has footed the bill for the state, though reciprocation has been few and far between. From being held solely responsible for the city\u2019s water and sewer infrastructure \u2014 systems also used by state employees in state buildings that happen to be exempt from property taxes \u2014 to being expected to continue offering a police presence at events outside the city\u2019s jurisdiction, Jackson has carried the state. \n\nBut the state \u2014 specifically the Legislature \u2014 rarely has opened its arms and pocketbook to help pay. \n\nIt\u2019s like the one friend who doesn\u2019t chip in when the pizza arrives. After a few times of getting away with it, the offer \u2014 no matter how disingenuous \u2014 to \u201chelp pay\u201d doesn\u2019t come again. \n\nJackson can\u2019t keep footing the bill and be expected to thrive. At some point, the city has to stand up for itself, especially in the absence of others coming to its defense. \n\nYarber and Vance had to make a decision, one that will help the city navigate through lean times. It\u2019s a choice many won\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s the job of Jackson leaders to be good stewards of taxpayers\u2019 money. \n\nAll spending has to be analyzed, and cuts must be made. Unfortunately, much harder cuts could be on the table as the city rushes to craft a budget for the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. \n\nThe $300,000 donation of JPD officers\u2019 presence at the state fair is one of the nonessential services the city rightfully slashed. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1EzFZHW", "source": "Clarion-Ledger"}
