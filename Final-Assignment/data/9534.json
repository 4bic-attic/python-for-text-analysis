Case in point - Braxton Miller. When he was hurt last year, fans couldn't wait for him to leave, wishing that he would transfer - hoping it would happen and disappointed when it didn't. That was magnified with the job that JT Barrett did at quarterback and then ultimately with what Cardale Jones was able to accomplish - which nearly put Barrett on the outs. \n\nNow Braxton Miller is a stud and a hero again - and everyone is so grateful that he stayed and talks about how awesome he is. It makes for a fascinating case study. We never seem to appreciate what we have, whether its getting the chance to watch a phenomenal athlete or a great team, or even our possessions.", "source": "Mark's Messages Weblog"}
