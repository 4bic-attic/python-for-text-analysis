He is a complete striker,\" Ayew told the South Wales Evening Post. \"He plays in the air, he keeps the ball, he goes behind the back, he is quick.\n\n\"He is a player who was underestimated for a while. He is a big striker and with the opportunity he has had since January, he is proving that he is one of the top strikers in the league.\n\nGomis has started the current season with a goal in each of his four appearances to date, while Ayew has added three strikes of his own.", "source": "Sports Mole"}
