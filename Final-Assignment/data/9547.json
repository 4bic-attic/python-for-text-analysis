Five newcomers to the sport had to be turned away on Sunday.\n\u201cThe theft of the beginners equipment has left us a huge gap, with training courses booked, now having to be postponed for both young and old,\u201d said Mr Mills.\nA ride-on mower and a hand mower, together worth around \u00a3700, were also stolen when locks on the container were cut.\nMr Mills said the theft would impact on efforts to improve the site, off Rectory Road.\n\u201cThis field was just a field of mud, we\u2019ve built it up to be a range,\u201d he added.\nMembers travel from as far as Diss, Acle and Necton to use the range.\nOfficials believe the container was broken into between 6.30pm on Friday and 1pm on Saturday.\nThieves are believed to have used a Transit-type van, with double rear wheels.\nPolice said the equipment stolen was worth a total of around \u00a33,000 and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.\nContact Norfolk police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. \u2022Is your club suffering as a result of a crime?
