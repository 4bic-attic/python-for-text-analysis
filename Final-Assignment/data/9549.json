The top eight nations in this competition qualified for Saturday night\u2019s final, with all teams starting on a zero score. \n \nIt was a tough course - designed by Santiago Varela - with just seven riders jumping clear.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nBen Maher was first in for the Brits. Diva II rolled a pole to gain four faults in what otherwise was a foot-perfect round.\u00a0Jessica Mendoza also had one down riding Spirit T.\u00a0 \n \nLaura Renwick didn\u2019t have the best ride on Bintang II. The gelding took a dislike to the open water and was given four faults for a refusal. The ever-determined rider got Bintang over it, but he had a foot in the water and a further fence down. They also incurred four\u00a0time penalties for a total of 16 faults, which provided the drop score. \n Fantastic performance  \nThis meant Joe Clee had to go clear for Britain to be in with a chance of a decent place on the leaderboard. Utamaro d\u2019Ecaussines didn\u2019t let him down and produced a great clear round, which left the team on a total of eight faults. \n \nThis put them joint second with the Netherlands who also had eight faults, but the Brits produced a faster total time, to take second place. \n \nBelgium was first on four faults, with team member Gregory Wathelet also winning a \u20ac200,000 bonus for jumping clear round in both competitions. \n \nThe USA Ireland and Germany all finished on 12 faults, so once again time decided the outcome, with USA fourth, Ireland fifth and Germany sixth. Sweden was seventh and the Swiss team eighth. \n \nDi Lampard said it was a \u201cfantastic performance\u201d by the British riders and described her first year at chef d\u2019eqiupe as a \u201cdream\u201d. \n Determined  \n\u201cIf you\u2019d have given me a wish list at the beginning of the year \u2013 qualification for the Olympics was top of the list, and I also wanted to stay in the super league to guarantee our best venues for next year\u2019s approach to Rio. \n \n\u201cBut the three wins we\u2019ve had and two seconds have been fantastic and the team spirit\u2019s been great, too.\u201d \n \n\u201cLast night proved how determined they are. Joe has been magnificent all year, while Jessica has really grown throughout the season.\" \n \nThe 19-year-old has gone from strength-to-strength over the past few months, producing a great final round at the European Championships in Aachen. \n \n\u201cI was determined to bring Jess here, because it\u2019s given her two back-to-back championships\u201d said Di. \u201cShe\u2019s picked up here where she left off in Aachen and it means we\u2019ve got a big player for next year.\u201d \n Strongest team  \nThis was always Di\u2019s goal \u2013 to create a stronger squad by giving up-and-coming riders more experience at championship level. \n \nShe also hopes Big Star will be fully recovered from his injury \u00a0and back on the team.\u00a0Nick Skelton has been competing him for the first time this week at Vilamoura. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more depth and more strength that when we started this year,\u201d said Di. \u201cWe\u2019re going to defend out gold medal at Rio properly. We\u2019re not going to give it up easily. We\u2019ll have our strongest team next year.\u201d \n Very disappointed\u00a0  \nThe\u00a0 Furusiyya final at\u00a0 Real Club de Polo in Barcelona also hosted the\u00a0Longines Challenge Cup, which\u00a0was open to countries that failed to qualify for the last round. Qatar were with winners on nine faults, while France, Brazil and Australia were joint second on 12. Italy and Egypt came joint fifth with 13 faults.\u00a0 \n \nThe four-day show concluded yesterday (27 September) with\u00a0Ireland's Denis Lynch redeeming himself after incurring eight faults\u00a0in the Nations Cup final, to\u00a0win the\u00a0Longines City of Barcelona Grand Prix. \n \n\"I was very disappointed with my two fences down,\" said Denis. \"I should have ridden better as All Star's on great form. But I'm very happy to take the grand prix, as I've never won a grand prix with All Star before.\"", "source": "Horse & Country"}
