Meanwhile, new search teams rippled out into subdivisions beyond the initial 2-square-mile perimeter established on Tuesday. At least 100 investigators were on the ground. \n \nA major challenge was the lack of a description of the suspects beyond the vague one that came from the officer, who told dispatchers he was pursuing three suspicious men \u2014 two white, one black \u2014 moments before he was shot. \n \n\u201cThat was the only description provided,\u201d said Lake County Major Crimes Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko, the lead investigator on the case. \u201cSo of course we\u2019re getting the public calling in every time they see that match of three individuals or even two individuals. We\u2019ve closed out those leads completely as being unsubstantiated.\u201d \n \nLt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a 30-year police veteran, was shot Tuesday morning while pursuing the men he spotted on his way to work, Filenko said. Gliniewicz told dispatchers the three ran into a swampy area, and he requested a second unit. \n \nDispatchers soon lost contact with him. Backup officers found him about 50 yards from his squad car with a gunshot wound. He died soon after. \n \nFilenko said there was no indication he was intentionally targeted, though authorities did not rule out that possibility. \n \nThe initial, frenzied search for his killers involved law enforcement agencies from across the state. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks and scanned the terrain through rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. \n \nOn Tuesday night, they declared the initial search zone clear, allowing investigators to begin poring over the crime scene and surrounding area. \n \nStill, they knocked on doors with caution. \n \n\u201cI believe that the search teams did a thorough job, but I know there have been a number of national incidents where suspects have cleverly escaped or hidden in place,\u201d Filenko said. \u201cSo anything\u2019s possible.\u201d \n \nInvestigators were reviewing video recordings, but so far none has captured images of the suspects, Filenko said. \n \nDespite the challenges, he told reporters that he felt the teams were making progress. \n \n\u201cAs always, we\u2019re relying on the public, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAll it takes is one tip or good lead to break a case wide open.\u201d \n \nResidents of the usually sleepy community were urged to stay vigilant. Schools that went on lockdown the day of the shooting were closed a day later. \n \nAn emotional Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend and a father of four sons. \n \n\u201cWe lost a family member,\u201d Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d \u201dHis commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\u201d \n \nWorkers adorned the village hall with black and purple bunting in a display of mourning. Several evening vigils were planned. \n \nEleven-year-old Takoa Thomas, a sixth grader, stood on the side of a road with a handmade sign that read \u201cCops\u2019 lives matter. RIP GI Joe.\u201d \n \n\u201cI wanted to be out here to show support,\u201d the boy said. \n \nHis mother, Tara England, 41, said the boy\u2019s school was closed, and she had mixed feelings about their safety. \n \n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m out here is I don\u2019t want to be home alone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband\u2019s at work.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut if it were me, I\u2019d be long gone,\u201d she said of the suspects. \n \nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. \n \nGliniewicz\u2019s death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officers\u2019 deaths so their names can be enshrined on a Washington, D.C., memorial. \n \nIt says police shooting deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared with the same January-to-September period last year. There were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the recent fatal shootings, telling a housing conference in Washington that violence against \u201call of us, regardless of what uniform any of us wear\u201d must end. \n \nLynch said it\u2019s a \u201csad fact now\u201d that no one is safe, citing shootings of churchgoers at a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, moviegoers in Louisiana, military personnel in Tennessee and two television journalists killed on the air last week in Virginia. \n  In Other News", "source": "San Francisco Examiner"}
