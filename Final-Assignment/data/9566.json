He lived on a street median. Raimundo called it \u201cThe Island.\u201d \n \nHe had become known as the homeless man who sat and wrote alone in that spot everyday. He always seemed to have pen and paper in hand. Still, few knew what he was writing. \u201cWhen I saw him for the first time, he gave me one of his poems. From that moment, he started to be a part of my life,\u201d Monteiro says in a documentary about the poet. \n \nMonteira began collecting more of Raimundo\u2019s small poems. She wanted to know more about who Raimundo was. She became his friend. \n \n\u201cWriting is his passion. He writes everyday,\u201d Monteiro says. \u201cRaimundo always wanted to publish a book of his poems and as a person who lived in the street, it seemed impossible to him.\u201d Still, he wrote stories and poems every single day from his wooden stool. He took up whatever scraps of paper he could find, carefully cutting them to be the same size and dating them each with a serial number. \n \nHope is the heaviest weight a man can carry. It is the bane of the idealist. Signed, the Conditioned. \n  \nRaimundo is 77 years old. The poet and philosopher became homeless in the late 70s and has worked diligently for half his life on the streets in obscurity. That is, until Monteiro befriended him. She was impressed with her new friend\u2019s work and decided to start a Facebook page for the poet. She wanted to publish Raimundo\u2019s work so that others could see it and so that Raimundo could \u201crecognize himself as a man and an artist.\u201d \n \nMaterial hygiene. Mental hygiene. Here, I don\u2019t know which is harder to practice. Signed, the Conditioned. \n  \nRaimundo\u2019s Facebook page currently has more than 140,000 fans who have been touched by his story. \u201cAs a writer myself, I find this man to be a great inspiration of hope for the rest of the world,\u201d writes Erasmo L Gusman, Sept. 11 . Many others are touched by Monteiro\u2019s actions, \u201cThanks to you and Raimundo for blessing so many. We must never turn away from someone we may not understand. We might be turning away from an angel,\u201d writes Audrey Van Vliet. \n \nIn S\u00e3o Paulo shortly after Raimundo\u2019s work was published on the internet, people began to pay attention. They stopped by to say hello and chat with the poet just as Monteiro had done. Many even admitted that they always had wanted to talk with him, but were afraid to do so. Among those who wanted to contact Raimundo was his long lost brother who had sent a message through the Facebook page that Monteiro had set up. \n \nHis brother had wanted to find Raimundo for more than 57 years. When he came to the island, he\u2019d found Raimundo surrounded by trash. His brother was unkempt, his hair matted, his body dirty. He was dressed in black plastic bags. It was a shock. \u201cI suggested that he come live with me,\u201d he said. \n \nDamned is the man who abandons himself. These words show that the worse the situation is, never, ever should a man consider it lost. Signed, the Conditioned. \n  \nOn April 23, 2013 , Raimundo left \u201cThe Island\u201d to live with his brother and his family. Now, Raimunda is a part of his family again and with Monteiro\u2019s help, is working to publish his book.", "source": "Examiner.com"}
