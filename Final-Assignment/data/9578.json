But over the long pole, history has proven, dividends from quality companies are well worth the extra mental rigour that is required to hold shares. \n \nSo with that mind, here are three companies that offer dividends far greater than the official cash rate: \n Retail Food Group Limited  (ASX: RFG) \u2013 Forecast gross dividend yield: 8.7%  \nRetail Food Group is the owner of fast-casual dining chains such as La Porchetta, Crust Pizza and Donut King; and coffee brands such as Gloria Jeans. Its shares have fallen hard in recent months, and at today\u2019s prices look very cheap. In fact, I think they are so cheap that I recently bought shares for my portfolio. \n Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  (ASX: ANZ) \u2013 Forecast gross dividend yield: 9.4%  \nAccording to some analysts, ANZ Bank, like its peers, will cut its dividend payout in coming years as a result of increased regulation. Nonetheless, ANZ is a top quality global bank and is aggressively expanding into the Asia Pacific region. This may help it offset the forecast weakness in the local credit market over the medium term. \n Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd  (ASX: FLT) \u2013 Forecast gross dividend yield: 6.2%  \nLike the two companies above, Flight Centre pays fully franked dividends and remains well placed for growth over the long term. While some investors remain highly sceptical of the group\u2019s rollout of physical storefronts, the strategy continues to work well following many years of success. While short-term earnings may be impacted in the local market, Flight Centre\u2019s huge cash balance and international expansion reassure me that the best is yet to come. \n \nBuy, Hold or Sell? \n \nAt today\u2019s prices, I think ANZ shares are not a buy. On the contrary, I think both Flight Centre and Retail Food Group are solid investments for growth and income over the long term. While their results may be a little volatile in the short-term, their excellent dividend yields certainly trump my 2.4% term deposit! \n  \nOur BEST dividend stock idea NOW \n \nI already have a financial interest in Flight Centre and Retail Food Group shares (see my disclosure below) but I'm NOT rushing out to buy more today because Scott Phillips, lead advisor of Motley Fool Share Advisor , has just announced his\u00a0 #1 dividend stock of 2015-2016 -- I think it is a GREAT BUY today! \n \nIt is cheap, growing fast, and currently sports a grossed-up\u00a0 dividend yield of \u00a0 5.6% !
