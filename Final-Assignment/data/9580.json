As a result, the website was taken down Aug. 26, and some first-years have not completed the program, said Ravi Pendse, vice president for Computing and Information Services. \n \nThe program, called Agent of Change, experienced a breach in website security that compromised important student data, wrote Russell Carey \u201991 MA\u201906, executive vice president for planning and policy, and Maud Mandel, dean of the College, in a Sept. 4 email to first-years. \n \nStudents\u2019 private information such as student identification numbers, email addresses, Agent of Change usernames and passwords, gender identity, race, ethnicity, relationship status, sexual orientation and institution name were vulnerable to the intrusion, according to a Sept. 4 press release by We End Violence, the third-party vendor of Agent of Change. \n \nWe End Violence discovered a \u201cpotential intrusion\u201d into its website server Aug. 24, according to the press release. Exercising caution, the organization took down the Agent of Change website Aug. 26 and hired web developers to restore the site with enhanced security features. First-years who did not complete the module before Aug. 26 have not had access to the site since. \n \nAgent of Change brought in forensic experts to figure out how the hackers accessed the information, and an investigation is ongoing, Pendse said. We End Violence has not yet gathered any evidence indicating user information has been misused, according to the press release. \n \n\u201cAgent of Change only had direct information that students submitted on the site,\u201d Pendse said. Other information such as students\u2019 social security numbers and bank account numbers are stored with the University and were not accessible to the Agent of Change hacker, he added. \n \nThe University remains unsure of when the program will be relaunched, Pendse said. An abnormal increase in phishing has not been noted since the hack, he said. \n \nCarey and Mandel encouraged students who used the same password for\u00a0 both their Brown accounts and their Agent of Change accounts to promptly change their Brown passwords. Students also have the option of using a two-step verification for their Brown email accounts, which requires a password input on their computers as well as their mobile phones, Pendse said. \n \nSeveral first-years interviewed expressed little worry over their compromised data. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t change my password,\u201d said Logan Cody \u201919. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about it.\u201d \n \n\u201cI got the email, and I disregarded it,\u201d said Max Naftol \u201919. \u201cI don\u2019t care as much as I probably should,\u201d he said, adding that he also did not change his password.", "source": "Brown Daily Herald"}
