Ukip have confidence in the people\u2019s judgment on the issue of what is good governance. It is not direct rule. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \n\u201cSociety demands the removal of the Provo Army Council once and for all. There will be no \u2018life-lasting solutions\u2019 until the IRA is gone for good.\u201d \n\nMr McNarry said that the word of the Chief Constable on the IRA should be sufficient for politicians. And, in a criticism of the DUP and UUP push for a new Independent Monitoring Commission to rule on paramilitary ceasefires, he said: \u201cWe do not require a cobbled together alternative [to the PSNI] to rush forward a report.\u201d \n\nMr McNarry said that the DUP and UUP should \u201cstop their in-fighting and lamentable brinkmanship\u201d, telling the parties: \u201cYou look silly, ineffective and unimpressive.\u201d \n\nHe added: \u201cThe message could not be clearer: stop pussyfooting around; get stuck into negotiations before concessions are teased from you when you sit down at the table. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cIf you can\u2019t hack it, then move over \u2013 you won\u2019t ever again be trusted with another chance.\u201d", "source": "NewsLetter"}
