But for those who stayed behind, they gathered at St. Martha\u2019s Catholic Church in Miami Shores, where the Archdioceses of Miami is based. \n\nSue Longman, a parishioner of St. Martha's, said Pope Francis' mass in Cuba is a great thing. \n\nShe said the Pope's visit will draw international attention and respect in a way that no world leader could. \n\n\"He doesn't benefit from it at all,\" she said. \"He's just there to spread love and peace.\" \n\nCarlota Catrillom, another parishioner, agrees. As part of the universal Catholic church, she said the Pope's role is to spread the word of God to the world. \n\n\"He's not only doing the message today, he's doing the message to the whole world,\" she said. \n\nCatrillom, 64, said that normalized relations between Cuba and America will lead to a larger, more inclusive Catholic faith. \n\n\"It's only one Church, and Cuba is a part of that Church,\" she said. \n\nBut not all parishioners viewed the Pope's visit as a positive. Ibo Richards, 42, said the timing of the visit makes him nervous. He said he distrusts Cuba and the communist government. \n\nHe said he thinks the \"rogue government\" of Cuba set up the Pope's visit with nefarious intent. \n\n\"We don't get along with these people,\" he said. \"Cuba is a dangerous place for Cubans and Americans.\"", "source": "Miami Herald"}
