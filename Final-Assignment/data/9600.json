Load your mPerks digital coupons here.  Check out the sneak peek online ad here. (Be sure to switch locations to your own store.) And,\u00a0 check out the current online ad here.   \n(Note: Smaller neighborhood grocery Chicago Meijers such as Niles, Melrose Park, Berwyn, and Orland Park , go off different and more localized ads, so some of your deals may differ from those shown here. Please verify against your own ad. Other states, Northwest Indiana, and downstate IL are on the Sunday-Thursday ad schedule, so sales there start the Sunday before the Thursday they start in Chicagoland in IL. I use the Bolingbrook IL (Boughton) ad for these matchups.) \n \nTop Meijer Deals this Week\u00a0 \n  Meijer shredded or chunk cheese 3/$5.00  Dannon Oikos or Light & Fit Greek or Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt $.88  Bird\u2019s Eye Steamfresh or Recipe Ready vegetables or Baby Blends 3/$5.00  $1.00/1\u00a0Birds Eye Steamfresh Flavor Full Variety 8/16 SS  $1.00/1\u00a0Birds Eye Steamfresh Protein Blends 8/16 SS    Wheat Thins or Triscuits $1.99  $.75/2\u00a0Nabisco Cookie or Cracker product 4.5 oz or larger 8/9SS    Chi-Chi\u2019s 16 oz salsa $1.25  Kraft mayo or Miracle Whip 22-30 oz 2/$5.00  $.50/1\u00a0Kraft Mayo or Miracle Whip, 22 oz or larger 8/23 SS    80% lean ground beef $2.59/lb  Ball Park meat franks 15 oz pkg 3/$5.00  $.55/1\u00a0Ball Park Hot Dog Product 8/2 RP    Arm & Hammer 45-75 oz liquid or 32ct Ultra Power paks $2.99  $2.00/2\u00a0 ARM & HAMMER Power Paks Laundry Detergent \u00a0or in the 8/30 SS    Cottonelle 36 dbl roll or Scott 1000 sheet 27 roll bath tissue $16.99  $3.00/2\u00a0Cottonelle Bath Tissue 9pk or larger or Scott 1000 Bath Tissue 15pk or larger ( Target coupon )  $.50/1\u00a0Kleenex Cottonelle Bath Tissue (1) 9 pack or larger or (2) 4 pack or larger 8/9 SS    Friskies dry cat food 16lb $9.99  $3.00\u00a016lb Friskies dry cat food (Target coupon) 8/16 SS  $1.00/1\u00a0Purina Friskies Dry Cat Food bag 7/26 RP    20% off Jennie-O turkey burgers.
