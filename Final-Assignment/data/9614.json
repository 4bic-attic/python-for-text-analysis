It is one of those pictures that captivates, and the more one looks, the more one sees.\" \n \nThe last time the artwork was on the market was 1855, having remained in the same family collection for more than 150 years. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nIt is one of only three major paintings by Constable left in a private collection. \n \nThe painting will be exhibited around the world in Hong Kong, New York and Los Angeles, before leading  the  Old Master & British Paintings Sale on December 9.", "source": "Cotswold Journal"}
