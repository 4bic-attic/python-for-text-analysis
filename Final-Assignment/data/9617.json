Patty Murray, D-Wash., one of his administration\u2019s strongest supporters in the Senate. \n \nThe luncheon will be at the Westin Hotel, long the site of events for Democratic presidents and presidential candidates, with tickets starting at $250. Tables can be sponsored for $2,500 or $5,000.\u00a0 A VIP reception, with photo opportunities, usually precedes such events held for prominent figures in both parties. \n \nPresident Obama eats a Top Pot doughnut with Sen.

Rod Chandler, Linda Smith and George Nethercutt \u2014 and dispatched two-time Republican gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi.\u00a0 She has confounded pundits, such as panelists on TV\u2019s \u201cThe McLaughlin Group\u201d who predicted in 1998 that Linda Smith would be Washington\u2019s next senator. \n \nMurray has lately acquired an opponent in lobbyist/pundit/politician Chris Vance, a former Republican state chairman.\u00a0 Vance was free with his opinion, and poll figures, that Murray would lose her 2010 re-election race. \n \nPresident Obama greets supporters at Boeing Field on 2011 trip to raise campaign money.\u00a0 He headed for mansions and five-figure fundraising events. \n \nMurray won election to the Senate in 1992, in a campaign that cost only $1.2 million.\u00a0 Especially since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision \u2014 which wiped out limitations on spending that went back 103 years \u2014 fundraising has become a never-ending occupation.\u00a0 In the period from Jan. 1, 2011 to June 30, 2015, Murray raised $6.599 million. \n \nMajor interests did come after her in 2010.\u00a0 Crossroads GPS, a secretive \u201ceducational\u201d group cofounded by Republican strategist Karl Rove, sent $5.5 million on anti-Murray ads in the 2010 election. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce kicked in $997,000 in the closing days of the campaign. \n \nMurray began her fundraising for the 2016 election within days of the 2014 mid-term election, with expensive receptions hosted by Vulcan Inc. executives and leaders of the gay-lesbian community. \n \nObama has come frequently to the state, most of the time to raise money.\u00a0 A typical visit has seen the president travel from a mansion in Medina to a mansion in Seattle, with the tab for a presidential brunch once reaching $17,200.\u00a0 Unlike the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, Obama has held few public events here since the 2010 Murray campaign. \n \nObama traveled to Oso, site of a tragic mudslide, last year to spend time with victims\u2019 families and first responders,\u00a0and created a San Juan Islands National Monument to protect several famous beauty spots in the island archipelago. \n \nVance, in a \u201cThoughts from the Week\u201d report, noted that after the \u201cfrantic activity\u201d of his announcement, \u201cwe settled into a more normal pattern in which I spend most of my campaign time on the phone raising money.\u201d", "source": "seattlepi.com"}
