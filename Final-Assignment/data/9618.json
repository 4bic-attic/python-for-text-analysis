The Facebook page for the event said: \"This event has been called in response to various reports of refugees fleeing war, persecution, torture and poverty, with many losing their lives or struggling to find a safe haven. This includes the death of 200 refugees off the coast of Libya, around 70 refugees in a truck in Austria and on-going reports of refugees drowning crossing the Mediterranean, in addition to those in Calais struggling to find sanctuary. \n\n\"The government response to this has been disgraceful. Unlike Germany, Italy and Greece, Britain has not offered a safe haven for these people. On the 12th September in London a march and a rally will be held attempting to lobby the UK government to change their stance on the current refugee crisis. \n\n\"In response to this, a group of community members of the local area feel that this issue needs to be raised with the people responsible within area, namely Torridge District Council and Geoffrey Cox. \n\n\"The aim is that we will all assemble at Torridge District Council car-park (Riverbank) at midday, where we will lobby outside the council buildings, before then moving through the town and along the quay to Geoffrey Cox's offices near the Old Bridge.\" \n\nThe national day of action involved Stand up to Racism, BARAC, Stop the War Coalition, Migrant Rights Network War on Want, Peoples Assembly Against Austerity, Movement Against Xenophobia, Unite Against Fascism, Love Music Hate Racism and Black Out London. \n  Related picture galleries    Most recent picture galleries", "source": "North Devon Journal"}
