It shows the Tories have regained the lead at 32 per cent support. The Liberals have 29 per cent support and the NDP is now down at 27 per cent. \n \nDavid Coletto with Abacus Data says the NDP has lost a ton of traction in Quebec, which is supposed to be an orange stronghold. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re down 17 points. They still have a lead, but it\u2019s a small six-point lead over the Liberals. As a result, we\u2019ve seen both the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois increase in Quebec.\u201d \n \nMore than 3,800 people took part in the survey, which also shows positive views for NDP leader Thomas Mulcair are dropping. \n \n\u201cHis overwhelming advantage in that province has declined. I think that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re seeing people move away from the NDP in their overall voting intention,\u201d says Coletto. \n \nThis poll isn\u2019t a one-off; the national drop in support for the NDP has also been shown in a survey by Nanos Research.", "source": "660 News"}
