I\u2019ve really seen a lot of improvement from Ryan Tannehill. I think he\u2019s ready to take that next step as an NFL quarterback and to me that was the missing ingredient for the\u00a0team. Now the question is can they stay healthy? And if they can\u2019t you\u2019re probably looking at a 7-9 team.\u201d \n \nFollow WQAM on Twitter | Facebook \n   \nBe sure to check out our\u00a0 FinsOn4 Live Dolphins Blog \u00a0 where we will\u00a0be posting season-long coverage, updates, photos,\u00a0video, commentary and more throughout\u00a0the entire 2015 season. \n \nWatch Miami take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this Thursday at 7 p.m. on CBS4, your official Dolphins station!\u00a0", "source": "CBS Miami"}
