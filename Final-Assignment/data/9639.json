This time we were there for two things: meeting a new race,\u00a0the Dwarfs (note the F - these are not Tolkien's Dwarves) and actually playing a battle for ourselves. Specifically a\u00a0'Quest Battle'\u00a0called The Ambush of Thundering Falls, which kicks off with a short narrative cutscene. \n\nThe Dwarfs' aim, at the campaign level, is to right ancient wrongs. \u201cThey have their own unique mission system where, if you do something to piss them off, it will launch a grudge mission,\u201d says Jim Whitston, Warhammer's Lead Level Designer. \u201cThey have to resolve all their grudges before they achieve their victory conditions.\u201d The Dwarfs are also unlikely to expand their campaign territory like traditional Total War games\u2014they\u2019re more concerned with regaining their lost holds from the Orcs & Goblins, who in their own turn want to conquer more Dwarf holds, and to raid the human Empire for loot. \n\nWe\u2019ve already seen one of the Empire\u2019s late game Quests, the Battle of Blackfire Pass, where the Emperor Karl Franz must fend off a horde of high level Orcs. Thundering Falls features the Dwarfs fighting against Orcs & Goblins. \u201cAt its core, it\u2019s still a Total War sandbox game, so these are just quests that you access via the Legendary Lords skills tree,\u201d says Whitston. \u201cThat unlocks a sequence of missions, which culminates in one of these quest battles.\u201d \n\nThese Quest battles are unique to each race, and tied into particular heroes. They\u2019re a way of introducing narrative into the Total War engine. \u201cIt lets us do some storytelling,\u201d says Whitston. \u201cPlayers that are familiar with Warhammer, there will be a lot of stuff in there that chimes with their knowledge. Players that are new to it, it\u2019s an insight into thousands of years of lore\u2026 Wherever possible we\u2019re keen to get, not just the history of the game, but a flavour of what it\u2019s like to play the tabletop game.\u201d \n\n\n\nThis battle appears to be a quest for the Dwarf High King, Thorgrim Grudgebearer. Thorgrim\u2019s an unusual character in Warhammer. Most legendary heroes, like the Vampire Count Mannfred Von Carstein or Karl Franz, are highly mobile and can be mounted on a variety of steeds. Others, like the Dwarf Slayer King Ungrim Ironfist (who\u2019s also in this game), fight only on foot. But Thorgrim is only available mounted on a throne, carried by elite Dwarfs, like a grumpier, shorter Vitalstatistix. He\u2019s horribly slow and tough, and best in melee, which makes him a target for enemy monsters and artillery. \n\nHe also reads constantly from his Great Book of Grudges, a litany of all the wrongs the Dwarfs have suffered over the centuries, which inspires nearby troops. He carries a runic axe, handed down by the god Grimnir himself. Even the chair he\u2019s sat on is indestructible, supposedly made by the god Grugni. \n\nOr at least this is all meant to be the case. Thundering Falls is actually part of the prelude for the Dwarf campaign, which means we\u2019ve got the unlevelled king here. \u201cA lot of that content we\u2019re featuring in the (heroes\u2019) skills trees\u2014you\u2019ll unlock it as you go down different branches,\u201d says Whitston. And there\u2019s no sign of Thorgrim\u2019s magic Axe of Grimnir, like there was no sign of The Hammer of Sigmar on Karl Franz, so we suspect it\u2019s the end reward to his quest chain. He does however have a health potion, which he would have acquired through a mission or victory in battle. \n\nThundering Falls introduces a totally new setting to Total War\u2014underground battles. Sadly, that doesn't mean that they differ particularly from surface battles, save that they've got walls and a roof. There's no low ceiling to deter fliers, no battling like tunnel rats in The Deep Roads, no spelunking. It\u2019s just a normal battle in a different locale, although it does mark the first time a Total War map has deviated from being square. The Dwarfen Underway is a long road, relatively narrow compared to typical Total War battlefields, which will influence positioning and formations.\u00a0Certain units like Dwarf Miners and certain hero abilities also\u00a0get bonuses in underground battles. \n\n\n\nThe difference tunnels make is larger on the campaign map. Here armies that use the underground travel network can bypass blockages\u2014going under armies and cities. However, they can still be intercepted by the armies en route and they have to come up for air at the end of their move. Obviously\u00a0the Dwarfs have their underground network,\u00a0as do the Skaven, the burrowing, plotting ratmen of the Warhammer world. Sieges against Dwarf settlements will take place in this underground setting. \n\nElements like the Underway show how Total War has been married to Warhammer. Including these tunnel networks is pure Warhammer\u2014but making it so armies have to surface like broken submarines, presumably in the name of balance, is completely Total War. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not replicating Warhammer,\u201d says Al Bickham, CA\u2019s Studio Communications Manager. \u201cwe\u2019re putting the ideals and the paraphernalia of the tabletop game into the system we use.\u201d \nDwarfs, to arms! \nThe battle starts with us looking down on the Dwarf lines\u00a0whilst Thorgrim gives a speech. It\u2019s much better than the one we got from Karl Franz, with the High King channeling a vengeful Lancastrian grandfather nicely, and using lots of Dwarfish like \u2018Grobi\u2019 and \u2018Dwabi.\u2019 At the King\u2019s side is a Thane, one of the game heroes who act as an independent characters on the campaign map like Total War's traditional Agents, but can join up with armies for battles. \n\nThe Dwarf playstyle is unlike the more-balanced Empire, given how slow dwarfs move. It\u2019s all about defense, with a huge range of cannons, volleyguns, flame cannons, handgunners, quarrellers (crossbow-dwarfs), and Irondrakes (flamer dwarfs). There are also a few infantry regiments of hardy warriors, two troops of double-handed axe wielding Longbeards and a regiment of naked Trollslayers (who have the charming ability description \u201cfast...for a dwarf\u201d). Their role is\u00a0to fend off the enemy from getting to grips with the artillery. We\u2019re also told to expect gyrocopter reinforcements partway through the battle; these flying machines are the nearest the Dwarfs have to cavalry. \n\nWhat\u2019s notably missing here is any sort of wizard. Dwarfs don\u2019t have wizards, but they do have Runesmiths:\u00a0ancient, tough-as-stone anti-wizards, who engrave magic runes on weapons and armour. We\u2019re told that they\u2019re one of the other hero units for Dwarfs, alongside the war-machine augmenting Master Engineers. Also absent are the elite attack-oriented hammerers and defense-oriented ironbreakers, the miners, the rangers, the ludicrous Gyrobomber, and a few of the more boring Dwarf war machines like the bolt-thrower and stone-thrower. \n\n\n\nOnce we\u2019ve arranged our units on top of an ancient Dwarfish slag heap, we start the battle. The main Orc & Goblin army starts trundling slowly towards us, whilst enemy units pour out from reinforcement points at side passages along the Underway. It immediately has a scissors-rock-paper feel about it again. The artillery and handgunners deal with most threats, but fast units like Goblin spider riders need to be finished off by the infantry. \n\nOnce we\u2019ve cleared the left and right ambushes, we get a second attack from behind by Trolls and a single Giant. The trollslayers,\u00a0who are scared of nothing and specialise in killing big monsters,\u00a0are the logical choice to take them down, even if they\u2019ll get wiped out in the process. \n\nMeanwhile, my frontline is holding against the Goblin\u2019s ineffectual assaults, both ranged and melee, but their Doom Diver catapults are doing some nasty damage to our close packed units. Luckily, the gyrocopters have just arrived, which are perfectly suited to rapid artillery destruction, even if they\u2019re a bit micro-heavy\u2014and you\u2019d never use them against other flying creatures. Each gyrocopter is equipped with two bombs which are dropped straight below them\u00a0with a click.\u00a0We send them off to deal with them, having them drop bombs over the massed goblin hordes as they fly by. \n\nStill, we\u2019ve only fended off the enemy and now the main army\u2019s upon us, complete with a Legendary goblin shaman riding a wolf, who\u2019s a nightmare to pin down despite the godrays that highlight all in-battle characters (\u201cif he wasn\u2019t an annoying little shit, he wouldn\u2019t be a goblin,\u201d says Whitston), and an Arachnarok Spider. These house-sized spiders mostly can't be hurt by non-Elite units because of their thick chitin. Only units with the armour-penetrating ability like Thorgrim, the Thane and the Longbeards have a good chance of taking this monster down, so I throw them into the fray. The Thane has a nice charge ability to cause extra damage, as well as a magic item that debuffs the Spider. \n\nWith my best squads tied up against a single unit, the rest of the army is in trouble. Orc Big Un boarboys overrun the left flank, with a few surviving trolls muddling through into our rear, dribbling trollslayers. I send the gyrocopters in for support, but goblin archers make short work of them. I lose convincingly\u2014three times, actually. (We were playing on hard difficulty, before you doubt our Dwarfishness.) \n\n\n\nThe dwarfs are a nice addition to the Total War universe. The sheer amount of artillery they can field means that they you\u2019d have to be insane to assault them directly,\u00a0but their slow speed of movement makes it hard for them to deal with changing battlefield conditions. Their campaign mechanics mean that they\u2019re natural allies with the Empire, and natural enemies to Orcs and Skaven. \n\nIn the final game, they\u2019ll join the Orcs & Goblins, Empire and the so-far unrevealed Vampire Counts. After that, as Creative Assembly\u2019s PR manager confirms, \u201cit\u2019s basically two very, very large standalone expansions which will all bolt together to form the whole world, and there\u2019ll be free DLC and DLC drops in-between.\u201d That\u2019s several years of Warhammer Total War right there\u2014we\u2019ll have to see how the prospect of three games goes down with the public. It definitely dwarfs any other game.
