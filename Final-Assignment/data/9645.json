So what did he think? \n \n\"I saw a rough cut and I felt like I was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others, not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right,\" he said, according to Deadline . \n \nWozniak is also a character in \"Steve Jobs,\" which comes out on October 9. He is played by Seth Rogen. The actor had some kind words for Wozniak, telling Variety over the weekend that he is \"immensely lovable,\" \"sweet, compassionate, caring,\" and \"the kind of guy you want to give a hug to.\"", "source": "NBCNews.com"}
