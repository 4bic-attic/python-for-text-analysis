Could I keep going until the next one in 2019? Well if I was still playing by then I'd be worried. \n \n\"I'd be asking myself, 'Where the hell are all the young wingers?' \n \n\"I'd be over the moon if I was still around this team by 2019, but I hope to God there is someone coming along to take my place. \n \n\"We've got the likes of Damien Hoyland, Rory Hughes and Dougie Fife coming through, so there are plenty of boys about. \n \n\"But I won't retire. Someone will retire me, but it won't be my decision.\" \n \nLamont has been to the last two World Cups but, while the tournament is the pinnacle for many, his memories are only filled with regret. \n \nIn 2007 the Scots looked set for a semi-final slot until Argentina robbed them of the chance. \n \nThe Pumas then roared louder again four years later as Andy Robinson's side failed to even make it out of their group. \n \nThe Scots are now gearing up for crucial clashes with Japan, America, South Africa and Samoa in Pool B, and Lamont wants his team to learn from the mistakes of the past. \n \nHe said: \"Both my previous World Cup experiences were a bit of a disappointment, if I'm being frankly honest. \n \n\"I loved going and it was great to be part of it. But in 2007 we blew the chance to make a semi-final, which would have been incredible. \n \n\"We should have beat Argentina in the quarters. We played all the rugby but didn't see out the win. That's why it was such a pain in the bum. \n \n\"Then last time around we didn't even make it out the group, which was disgraceful. \n \n\"The alarm bells were ringing in the first two games against Romania and Georgia when we struggled against both. We then had the Argentina game all but wrapped up and a 30-second lapse of concentration cost us the game. \n \n\"That left us having to beat a tough England side by 14 points, which was a big ask at any time, never mind in a World Cup. \n \n\"So I'm acutely aware of the fact that every pool game we play has got to be top notch. \n \n\"We can't just focus on South Africa in the third game as the important one. We're not that good. We're good, but just look at the defeat to Tonga in Aberdeen a couple of years ago. That could happen again if we don't go in with the right attitude.\"", "source": "London Evening Standard"}
