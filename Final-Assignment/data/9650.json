Although we have access to peaches year-round, I refuse to buy them at any other time of the year. It just seems wrong somehow; a peach in the middle of a snowy winter?? This grilled peach salad is often the very first dish I make once I get my hands on these beauties. I\u2019ve made this one for you before , but this time I added a basil vinaigrette to up the flavor ante even more. \n\nThe presentation for this grilled peach salad is a bit different this time around, too. I love making a big presentation with salads \u2013 they\u2019re so easy to arrange in fun, different ways \u2013 and this time I kept things really simple. No stacking or layering , just a plain white oval plate with the ingredients laid out so you can see their gorgeous grill marks \u2013 makes me drool just looking at these photos! I keep all of the ingredients on hand throughout the summer so I can make this grilled peach salad as often as I like. \n\n\n\nThe basil vinaigrette also gets made often around here in the summertime as I always have more basil than I can use . I usually double the batch and pour it over either this grilled peach salad or even just over some quick grilled vegetables for lunch or a healthy snack. Sometimes I\u2019ll just break out my grill pan if I\u2019m making it just for me; just because it\u2019s summer doesn\u2019t mean the grill pan has to wait! Of course, the smoky flavor you get from the grill can\u2019t be duplicated, but my grill pan does the job in a pinch. \n\n\n\nThe basil vinaigrette does need a bit of sweetness to balance the acidity; I use just 1/2 teaspoon of\u00a0 zero-calorie \u00a0 Truvia\u00ae Natural Sweetener \u00a0which adds just the right amount of sweetness for my tastes. I love that just a little goes a long way and that tiny bit makes a world of difference in the flavor of the vinaigrette. Be sure to use fresh lemon juice, too; it just won\u2019t be the same without fresh ingredients. You\u2019ll want to keep it on hand to toss with just about anything you throw on the barbecue! \n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\nPrint  Yum Grilled Peach Salad with Basil Vinaigrette \n \n\nThis recipe serves about 1-2 people. I'll make the entire recipe for myself for lunch or a light dinner. \n\nIngredients \nFor Basil Vinaigrette 1 garlic clove Juice from 1 large lemon 1/4 cup good-quality extra-virgin olive oil 5-6 basil leaves 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar 1/2 teaspoon Truvia (or 1 teaspoon sugar) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or to taste) 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper For the salad 1 heirloom tomato, thickly sliced 1 summer peach, thickly sliced 1 thin slice of a red onion 1 ear of summer corn 1/4 c high-quality feta cheese, crumbled drizzle of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil kosher salt (use very lightly; the feta is already salty) & freshly ground black pepper, coarse grind {both to taste} \nInstructions \nPlace all ingredients for vinaigrette into a high-powered blender. Blend until very smooth and set aside. Grill corn, peaches and onion slice over high heat until charred on both sides (peaches should be grilled but still fairly firm).
