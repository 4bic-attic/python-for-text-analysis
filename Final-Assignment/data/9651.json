Yes. Yes it is. #byebyewristband\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nAmong the eccentric activities on offer is a fake wedding ceremony hosted in an inflatable chapel, which couples pay \u00a345 to take part in. \n\nSimeon, the church's appointed choirboy, said: \"There comes a time in your life when you feel you need to share your love in a giant rubber church. \n\n\"We dress people up in whatever they want to wear, get the congregation in, get the DJ playing and everyone goes nuts.\" \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.", "source": "Daventry Today"}
