He is much too important for our team. \n \n\"I don't think he shall play against PSV. It is a minor injury and I believe he shall play against Southampton (on Sunday).\" \n \nVan Gaal must decide whether to stick with Marouane Fellaini, who started up front against Liverpool, or bring goal-scoring debutant Anthony Martial into the starting line-up. \n \nAnother alternative is 19-year-old striker James Wilson, who has been named in the travelling party for the game at the Philips Stadion. \n \nDavid de Gea has been included in the squad after he was brought in from the cold for the win over Liverpool. \n \nBrazilian midfielder Andreas Pereira, who signed for United from PSV four years ago, has overcome his injury troubles and is included in the squad.\u00a0 \n\nPhil Jones is still absent as he continues his recovery from thrombosis.", "source": "Mid Day"}
