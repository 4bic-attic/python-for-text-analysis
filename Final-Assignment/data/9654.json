There are two remaining Fed policy meetings scheduled this year, in late October and mid-December. \n \n\"Overall, the dollar is strengthening,\" said Vassili Serebriakov of BNP Paribas. \"The market is reevaluating its position on the Fed.\" The euro was under pressure on expectations the European Central Bank could be preparing additional bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, to boost the flagging 19-nation eurozone. \n \nThe single currency traded at US$1.1195, down from US$1.1299 Friday. \n \nKathy Lien of BK Asset Management said all eyes will be on ECB President Mario Draghi's testimony to the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday. \n \n\"If the head of the European Central Bank confirms that they could boost the quantitative easing program, EUR/USD could test 1.10,\" she said. \n \nAFP", "source": "Business Times Singapore"}
