It's really a Montreal film, so I'm really happy I'm here to represent Canada and Montreal,\" Giroux said at a press conference in Montreal on Friday afternoon.\u00a0 \n \n\"It was a film made with a small budget\u00a0and kind of a challenge in every term,\" he added. \n \nIn the past six years, Canada has had four films make it as best foreign-language film finalists:\u00a0 \n Incendies , directed by Denis Villeneuve.  In Darkness , directed by Agnieszka Holland (a co-production).  Monsieur Lazhar , directed by Philippe Falardeau.  Rebelle , directed by Kim Nguyen.  \nLast year's submission \u2013 Xavier Dolan's Mommy \u2013 failed make it to the final list of nominees. Previous Canadian Oscar finalists included Deepa\u00a0Mehta's Water and Denys\u00a0Arcand's films The Decline of the American Empire ,\u00a0 Jesus of Montreal and The Barbarian Invasions \u2013 which ultimately won in 2004. \n \n\"When you\u00a0look at all the films that [have]\u00a0represented\u00a0Canada\u2026 it's incredible. Those directors are,\u00a0how do I say,\u00a0inspired\u00a0\u2026To be next to them is an honour,\" Giroux added. \n \nThe foreign-language film race is already heating up, with most\u00a0countries confirming their selections over the past week as the U.S. film academy's Oct. 1 deadline approaches. \n \nOther notable submissions that have earned international kudos already include France's pick Mustang , Hungary's choice Son of Saul , China's Wolf Totem and The Assassin , Taiwan's contender. \n \nThe 88th Academy Awards will take place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Calif.,\u00a0on Feb. 28.", "source": "CBC"}
