I forget about your smile and the butterflies you gave me. I forget about the late night phone calls and playing video games together. I forget about the plans for the future we made. I forget about the girl I used to be, the girl who would have followed you to hell and back. I forget that I had a love for you that rivaled\u00a0fairy tales.\n\nThe other night I heard your voice. At least, I thought I did. It wasn't you, it was just another guy at the bar, but in that moment\u00a0I remembered. No matter how long it's been, there are still times when I think of you and suddenly it gets harder to breathe. But you know what? In that moment of remembrance, I forgot something else.\n\nI forgot that you threw me away, I forgot about the days I spent lying in bed feeling broken and betrayed. I forgot about the lies I told for you and the lies I told myself. I forgot about the years I spent stuck reliving the same tragedy over and over again.\n\nIt wasn't until I was under the harsh florescent lights of a gas station that I remembered. And with that remembrance I found a small piece of clarity and\u00a0acceptance. I don't love you anymore. You, and all the love\u00a0I had for you is\u00a0becoming something I can forget.\n\nAnd sometimes, sometimes I forget to be sad that it's gone.", "source": "The Life & Thoughts of a Former College Chick"}
