I think we will probably get there a bit earlier. \r\n\r Ian Cox \r \r\n\r \nCox said: \u201cWe said two years ago we thought in five years we could have a title challenging unit. I think we will probably get there a bit earlier. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to step up and win consistently against the top teams, but I see no reason why in another year or two we couldn\u2019t be genuine title contenders, maybe even next year. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \n\u201cI can see Bexhill in the next five years being there or thereabouts and two or three extra wins we would\u2019ve been in the mix at the end of this season. I think we\u2019re maybe a 10-15% improvement in all areas away from that.\u201d \n\nLast weekend\u2019s final day win away to relegated Eastbourne was Bexhill\u2019s 10th league victory of the campaign - a fine achievement for a young team which should only get better in time. \n\n\u201cThe beauty of this year is we\u2019ve had no superstars; it\u2019s been a real team performance,\u201d continued Cox. \u201cSome of these boys really will kick on. Somebody will have a bang season with the bat and that will make a massive difference. \n\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve improved to the degree where we\u2019re expecting to go out and win against those bottom half teams, and we\u2019re doing that. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cThere\u2019s a big jump up to those clubs that have got a bit more pulling power. We\u2019ve got to try and bridge that gap now and I think we will. I think the future of the first team looks very promising.\u201d \n\nCox says it\u2019s unlikely that overseas player Dean Crawford will return from Australia for a third season in 2016, but the club has already had two or three emails from people keen to fly over and play. \n\nWhether Ashar Zaidi will be back next year is likely to depend on if he\u2019s offered a new contract by Sussex. If not, he may well go back to the Manchester area. \n\nCox himself will be stepping aside after three years in the role, during which he\u2019s seen Bexhill win promotion from Division Two before finishing sixth and fourth in the Premier League. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it, but the time\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve matured and progressed massively as cricketers. They can do it, they\u2019ve proved they can do it and they need to understand it\u2019s down to them to motivate themselves. Most of the game\u2019s played up top and I think they\u2019re just starting to get to grips with that.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live. \n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on. \n\n1 Make this website your homepage \n\n2 Like our Facebook page at facebook.com/pages/Sport-Sussex \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n3 Follow us on Twitter @SportSussex \n\n4 Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).
