I\u2019m sure it does to most parents of teenagers who come to my clinic. And I am sure these parents have heard retorts such as, \u201cOnly old people lose their hearing,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just music, so it\u2019s safe,\u201d or \u201cI heard you, so I can hear just fine!\u201d Wrong on all counts. Today, more than ever, young people are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss because of repeated exposure to loud sounds from personal listening devices like iPods or MP3 players inserted into the ears. When I see teenagers in the Otolaryngology Clinic at Texas Children\u2019s, they are surprised to find out that when they turn the volume up to the max of 150 decibels on their MP3 player, they may as well be standing on a runway of an airport as planes fly by. Being young, they may not take the danger of noise-induced hearing loss seriously. But they should. When I tell parents that up to 16 percent of young adults suffer from hearing loss directly due to listening to loud music, they begin to pay a bit more attention. When I tell them hearing loss can result in reduced school performance and affect their grade point average and where they go to college, they pay even more attention. And by the time I mention noise-induced hearing loss can result in wearing hearing aids, they are usually \u201call ears.\u201d Excuse the pun! Many teenagers are not even aware they suffer from hearing loss. But, moms usually can tell. If you suspect your teen or child has a hearing loss, seek a hearing evaluation by an audiologist at our Hearing Center, Audiology Department at Texas Children\u2019s.\u00a0 If your child has been diagnosed with a hearing loss, schedule an appointment with an otolaryngologist, a physician who treats conditions of the ear, nose or throat, to help with elucidating the diagnosis and for treatment options for hearing loss or other ear-related conditions.\u00a0Call our clinic at 832-822-3250 or Texas Children\u2019s West Campus location at 832-227-1420 for more information.", "source": "Texas Children's Blog"}
