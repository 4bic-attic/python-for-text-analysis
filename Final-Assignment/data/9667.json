Picture:   \nAnother area of Rottnest is to be opened up to private developers, with interest being sought in the creation of new \u201cglamping\u201d \u2014 or up-market camping \u2014 accommodation near the island\u2019s favourite swimming spot. \n\nDetails of the plans are in expressions-of-interest documents to be released to the market today. \n\nIt seeks \u201cquality holiday accommodation\u201d on about 16,000sqm of land behind the dunes at Pinky Beach, a small bay next to The Basin. \n\nIt is understood the accommodation would need to be of \u201clow-impact lightweight construction\u201d and offer a \u201chigh-quality outdoor accommodation experience\u201d. \n\nToday\u2019s release comes after the State Government sought last month for a developer to build a new marina \u2014 and adjacent holiday units \u2014 at the army jetty in Thomson Bay. \n\nThe Rottnest Island Authority has also recently confirmed it is in negotiations with two groups for a five-star hotel on the controversial Mt Herschel site, on the northern side of the island. The glamping area will be between the existing camping area and the beaches at The Basin and Pinky Beach. \n\nDevelopers will also have the option of backfilling and landscaping a nearby former waste settlement pond. \n\nThe site of Rottnest\u2019s proposed glamping area near The Basin.
