JOHN'S, N.L. - Supporters of a hearing-impaired student who says he wasn't accommodated by Memorial University of Newfoundland say an apology and promised review are not enough.\n\nThird-year student William Sears is pursuing a human rights complaint after a history professor refused to wear an assistive hearing device due to religious beliefs.\n\nThe FM transmitter is intended to help Sears hear class instruction.\n\nThe students' union is planning a rally at the St. John's campus Wednesday and is urging participants to express their \"outrage.\"\n\nLeah Robertson, the union's director of advocacy, says the university mishandled the case and that highlights bigger problems.\n\nShe says the school must do a better job of ensuring students with special needs have full access to education.\n\nMUN president Gary Kachanoski says arrangements should have been made for the student before he arrived in class earlier this month.\n\nContent Provided By Canadian Press.", "source": "CJAD 800"}
