This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. \n \nIn nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nGhana\u2019s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. \n \nTax income \n \nTax revenue amounted to GH\u00a211,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH\u00a210,516.3 million. \n \nIn nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. \n \nGDP estimates for first half of 2015 \n \nTotal expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH\u00a218,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH\u00a218,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). \n \nThe outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. \n \nThe cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH\u00a21. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). \n \nThe NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH\u00a24,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nForeign Financing of the budget was GH\u00a21,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH\u00a2206.1 million. \n \nThus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year.", "source": "Spy Ghana"}
