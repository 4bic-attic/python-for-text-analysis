I have a suggestion that will speed the game up without more rule changes. \n\nReduce the game time to 60 minutes (30 minute halves) and reduce the interchange to six only. It will test the recovery rate of our big men and allow our more brilliant players to display all the skills that they have, instead of having 120kg giants being fresh all the time with all of the interchanges. \n\nAnd finally the men in control, I think that they are as confused as the rugby league fan, because the NRL have made such a simple game so complicated with these different interpretations of all the rules. \n\nThey are not game to make a decision because of these changes. The NRL will not increase the numbers of support for our game until you get the video ref and on field officials making less mistakes with their decision making. \n\nThis is nothing new, every League fan wants changes regarding this issue, but it is slow in coming. \n\nJack Lewis, Berserker Real Estate Real Estate Real Estate", "source": "Daily News"}
