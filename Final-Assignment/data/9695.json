As end-users of drone technology, Realtors\u00ae want clear regulation that permits the commercial application of UASs in a way that is affordable to users and safe for their communities, both on the ground and in the air.\u201d NAR has been working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration and others to advance a responsible approach to commercial drone use. To that end, NAR joined the \u201cKnow Before you Fly\u201d campaign earlier this year and is a part of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration\u2019s \u201cMultistakeholder Process: Unmanned Aircraft Systems,\u201d a working group on privacy as it relates to the use of drones. In his testimony, NAR President Chris Polychron applauded the House Judiciary Subcommittee for its attention to this issue. \u201cRealtors\u00ae have shown a consistent interest in the safe, responsible use of drones in the business of real estate, and I appreciate Chairman Darrell Issa and Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler for giving us the opportunity to share that perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to a continued partnership with the committee as our work on this important issue moves forward.\u201d Although wide-scale commercial use of drones is currently prohibited, the FAA has worked to streamline a waiver process for individuals and businesses interested in using drones. So far, the FAA has issued over 1,300 such waivers. A significant percentage of those waivers have gone to users in the real estate business. The National Association of Realtors\u00ae, \u201cThe Voice for Real Estate,\u201d is America\u2019s largest trade association, representing over 1.1 million members involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries.
