Porsche shares fell by as much as 24%.\u00a0Volkswagen stopped sales of the models in question and almost 500,000 vehicles have been recalled. The company may face up to \u20ac18 billion in fines. \n \nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to Volkswagen on September 18.\u00a0The company admitted to fitting the US diesel engines with software that only turns on the car\u2019s pollution controls when undergoing official emissions testing. The cars in question would pollute 10-40 times the legal limits during normal driving, emitting high levels of nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog and ozone build up. \n \nThe EPA said four cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from 2009-2015 have a sophisticated software algorithm that is able to tell when the car is being tested for emissions and can then turn on the emissions controls. The type of software that circumvents EPA emissions standards is defined as a \u2018defeat device\u2019 by the Clean Air Act. \u201cUsing a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,\u201d said Cynthia Giles of the EPA. \n \nAccording to the New York Times , automotive technology experts say that disengaging the pollution controls on a diesel car can result in increased acceleration and torque. \n \nThe issue was first raised when the International Council on Clean Transportation conducted real-world emissions tests and compared them to lab results.\u00a0Volkswagen chairman, Dr. Martin Winterkorn , said he was sorry for breaking the public\u2019s trust and that they would do, \u201ceverything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused.\u201d \n \nEarlier this month, Volkswagen was named the most sustainable automaker in the world in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The review looks at corporate performance, social sustainability and ecological sustainability. Volkswagen received full marks for climate strategy. \n \nThe European Commission has said it is taking this seriously and is in contact with U.S. \n \nVolkswagen is the world\u2019s largest automotive company and also owns Porsche and Lamborghini, but it has struggled to gain market share in the US. \n         Share", "source": "Business Plus Online"}
