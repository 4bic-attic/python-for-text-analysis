An underdog Vinci shattered Serena's hopes of completing a calendar grand slam with a 2-6, 6- 4, 6-4 win over the American at Flushing Meadows.       \"I don't want to talk about how disappointing it is for me,\" Serena snapped at reporters in her post-match press conference. \"If you have any other questions, I'm open for that,\" she added.        The world number one, who had been hoping to secure the first calendar grand slam since Steffi Graff in 1988, denied that the pressure of pursing the landmark had affected her game.         \"No. I've told you guys I don't feel pressure. I never felt pressure ... I've never felt that pressure to win here, I've said that from the beginning,\" the 21-time Grand Slam champion was quoted as saying by News.com.au.      Serena, who also saw her 33-match winning streak at majors end with the defeat, then called an end to her own press conference after hailing her 'Serena Slam'- holding all four grand slam singles trophies simultaneously.
