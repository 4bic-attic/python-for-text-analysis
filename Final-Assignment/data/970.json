The city of Dayton has requested that Maple Grove pass a resolution supporting the need and the application. \n\nStaff said, \u201cWith the number of high profile transportation projects underway the city of Maple Grove is fortunate to complete some of our highest priorities. One of our remaining projects, the extension of Hwy. 610, still seeks funding and could benefit from TED funds in the future. The Brockton Lane interchange does not appear to be in competition at this time.\u201d \n\nThere are plans for the extension of a sanitary sewer interceptor by the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services in the northwest corner of Maple Grove. This interceptor would serve the northern portion of Corcoran and the southern parts of Rogers and Dayton. \n\nThe Brockton Lane interchange would also provide a freeway access. \n\nOMNI BREWERY PATIO  \n\nAlso during the meeting, the council heard a request from OMNI Brewing Company to amend its current liquor license to include an outdoor patio area at its location at 9462 Deerwood Lane N. \n\nCity code states that an application for a proposed enlargement, alteration or extension of any premises previously licensed shall be provided to the city at least 60 days prior to the enlargement, alternation or extension taking place. \n\nSteve Hayes of OMNI Brewing said, \u201cWe thought of the idea of having a patio could wait until next year. As we near our opening day, we have been overwhelmed by the response we have received from the community and realize this \u2018wait until next year\u2019 approach isn\u2019t ideal.\u201d \n\nOMNI has food trucks scheduled to be on site every Friday and Saturday through the end of October. Hayes said a patio would help with crowd control as the interior space of OMNI would be unable to handle the excepted patrons. \n\nThe patio area would be contained by a fence. There would be signage in the patio area stating that alcohol containers are to remain in the patio area. The patio would have additional tables, seating, bathroom facilities and trash containers. \n\nThe council approved an amendment to OMNI Brewing Company to extend their current on-sale brewer\u2019s taproom/Sunday sale and brewer off sale intoxicating- small brewer license to include alcohol service for an outdoor patio. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST  \n\nThe council also recognized the winners in the annual Maple Grove Moments Photography Contest. \n\nYouth Recognition category winners each received $50.
