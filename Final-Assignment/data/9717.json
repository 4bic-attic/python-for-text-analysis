Not to mention the burden of security when it comes to remembering umpteen passwords or sharing login credentials,\u201d explained Terry Smithson, President of EduTone. \u201cWith the Global Grid for Learning, everyone has their own single username and password and a single point of access. It works on any device. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re at school, at home or somewhere in between \u2013 or what type of operating system you have.\u201d \n\nCentral to the Global Grid for Learning experience is a single sign-on Passport that provides a customizable and easy-to-use foldering and bookmarking environment from which to access all of a school or district\u2019s web-based resources \u2013 open educational resources, paid subscription services, state-provided resources and user-generated content. Schools and districts can easily upload their users into the Global Grid for Learning platform via CVS file or sync user data via Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, Office 365 or their existing LMS or SIS to setup and maintain permissions for web-based content and services with less effort. The Global Grid for Learning in turn allows schools and districts to more widely support 1:1, BYOD and mobile interoperability so that technology doesn\u2019t get in the way of learning. \n\n\u201cOffering the Global Grid for Learning to Pennsylvania schools supports our ongoing commitment to innovative technology solutions that enable cost savings and efficiency,\u201d said Vince Humes, Director of Innovative Technology Solutions for IU5. \u201c The Global Grid for Learning frees up people, time and money for schools and districts. Educators and students not only have easier access to web-based resources but schools and districts can scale more easily with less hardware, software, support requests and integrations.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Global Grid for Learning not only helps with the content and services schools have today,\u201d added Smithson, \u201cbut makes understanding the usage of web-based services that a district or school subscribes to more transparent. For school and district leadership trying to watch budgets closely, this is a great advantage when it comes to managing renewals and determining return on investment. Additionally, via the Marketplace, school and district administrators can more effectively pilot district-wide, school-wide and multi-school subscriptions to web-based services and subscribe to and set up these services more easily.\u201d \n\nEduTone is actively seeking business partnerships with existing networks to promote and distribute the Global Grid for Learning and customized regional Grids for Learning to schools both in the U.S. and around the world.
