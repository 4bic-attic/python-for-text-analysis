The error triggered a mandatory suspension of the new pot taxes. \n \nLawmakers decided to waive the taxes only for a single day, though voters will have to return to polls in November to authorize the state to keep some $50 million in pot taxes collected in 2014. \n \nConfused? So were many shoppers Wednesday \u2013 but they loaded up on lower-cost weed anyway. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just going to buy a little more than I normally do and hold onto it,\u201d said 41-year-old Tim Persoff. \n \n(credit: CBS) \n \nSome out-of-state visitors were shocked to see the virtually tax-free sale of weed. (It was still subject to local taxes and Colorado\u2019s basic 2.9 percent sales tax.) \n \n\u201cI saw online there was some kind of loophole on the taxes, so I had to come buy some,\u201d said David Illig of Onawa, Iowa, who was passing through on a drive to California. \n \nColorado tracks marijuana sales but doesn\u2019t make the data public, making it impossible to know if Wednesday set a single-day sales record. Several retailers said the day was akin to a busy holiday weekend. \n \nStill, shoppers and marijuana industry workers lauded the tax holiday as a needed break. \n \nIn a statewide tally made final Tuesday, Colorado reported that it collected much more in marijuana-specific taxes last fiscal year than alcohol-specific taxes. \n \n\u201cThe cannabis community has brought so much money to the state of Colorado, this is only fair,\u201d said Chad Drew, sales manager at Colorado Harvest Co. \n \n\u2013 By Kristen Wyatt, AP Writer \n \n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
