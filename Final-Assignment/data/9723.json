He was greeted by throngs of cheering Catholics. \n \nFrancis told those gathered at the Mass to pay attention to the call to serve and care for those who are the most vulnerable. \n \n A return to prayer for Castro? \n \nCuban President Raul Castro \u2014 an atheist \u2014 was among those in attendance at the Mass. After meeting with Francis at the Vatican in July, Castro said, \u201cIf the Pope continues talking like this, I may return to the church and start praying again.\u201d \n \nCNN\u2019s Patrick Oppmann recently took a look at the pair\u2019s unlikely chemistry and what that could mean for Castro\u2019s faith. \n \nIn addition to having an impact on Castro\u2019s views of the Church, the Pope also played a key role in the thawing of U.S.-Cuba relations. \n \n The Pope\u2019s secret diplomacy \n \nIn fact, the Pope has long been encouraging the U.S. and Cuba to play nice. \n \nIn an exclusive interview, Havana\u2019s Archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Ortega y Alamino, revealed to CNN that when the Pope and U.S. President Barack Obama met at the Vatican for the first time in March 2014, the Pope lobbied Obama to lift sanctions on Cuba. \n \nFrancis pressed leaders to go even further when he landed in Havana on Saturday, calling on the communist nation to \u201copen itself to the world.\u201d \n \nThe Catholic Church was once an integral part of Cuban history, the Pope said, inspiring veterans of its war for independence and \u201csustaining the hope which preserves people\u2019s dignity in the most difficult situations.\u201d \n \nIn his short speech, Francis also invoked Jose Marti, a Cuban hero, to deliver a veiled critique of the Castros, said Andrew Chesnut, a professor of Latin American history at Virginia Commonwealth University. Marti, a George Washington-type figure, died in 1895 during the war for independence \n \nBut not everyone is impressed with the Pope\u2019s efforts to deepen U.S. diplomatic ties with Cuba. \n \n\u201cI just think the Pope is wrong,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Republican presidential candidate said Sunday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe fact is that his infallibility is on religious matters, not on political ones,\u201d said Christie, who is Catholic. \n \n Aboard the papal plane \n \nThe Pope arrived in Cuba on Saturday afternoon, following a lengthy flight from Rome. CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores was on the papal plane with Francis, and had a chance to speak with him there. \n \nThe Pope will be in Cuba until Tuesday. He\u2019ll then head to Washington, New York and Philadelphia. \n \nFor a look at the biggest issues facing the Pope on this trip, take a look at this explainer from CNN Religion Editor Daniel Burke. \n \nAnd to see all of CNN\u2019s coverage of the Pope, visit CNN.com/PopeFrancis, and don\u2019t miss all the posts coming from our teams on the ground. \n \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r \r Pope meets with Fidel Castro in Cuba", "source": "GantDaily.com"}
