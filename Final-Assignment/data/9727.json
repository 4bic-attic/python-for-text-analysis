Hot on the heels of last week\u2019s announcement that the big blue network now has more than 1 billion daily users, the company is now crowing about a user milestone they\u2019ve reached on one of their two big messaging platforms, WhatsApp. Facebook bought WhatsApp about 18 months ago in a $19 billion deal. At the time, the app touted about 450 million monthly users, of whom roughly 315 million used the service every day. Reaching 900 million users means the user base has literally doubled since that purchase. But Facebook clearly had this growth in mind even at the time. Back when news of the acquisition went public, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement, \u201cWhatsApp is on a path to connect 1 billion people,\u201d adding, \u201cThe services that reach that milestone are all incredibly valuable.\u201d It\u2019s an impressive milestone, especially given that the smartphone world is not exactly suffering for a shortage of messaging apps. WhatsApp\u2019s major selling point is that it uses your data instead of \u201ccounting\u201d as SMS texts against your phone plan, but at this point, it\u2019s just one of many competitive apps out there promising the same\u2026 and texting doesn\u2019t cost what it used to, either. WhatsApp, however, is stringently against selling ads inside their platform, even going so far as to quote Fight Club on their home page as part of their explanation why. The current iteration of their privacy policy also has some strong affirmations against selling or sharing their data to third-party advertisers \u2014 a stance that seems somewhat at odds with the standard operating procedure of their parent company. Facebook clearly has a dominant stake in the messaging-app business. WhatsApp may be at the top as it closes in on that magic nine-zero mark, but the second-place contender \u2014 Facebook Messenger \u2014 has also crossed 700 million monthly users.
