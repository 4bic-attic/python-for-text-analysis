Buyers range from people looking for a small add-on home for aging relatives to property owners wanting to join in on the growing Airbnb movement. \n \nLani Johnston, producer of Auburn Home Shows, said that the tiny homes display at the spring home show were such a hit, she had to bring them back \u2013 and spruce the surroundings up with some decorative landscaping to set the tone. \n \n\u201cIt was such a hit and they\u2019re really hot,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe tiny homes are known on the east coast and up north but not here.\u201d \n \nThe fairgrounds was an anthill of activity on Thursday with contractors and exhibitors busily preparing for today\u2019s opening of the three-day home show. About 800 exhibits should spread out over the shaded grounds with pleasant temperatures forecast, Johnston said. \n \nSolar products will be another popular draw as well as bathroom and kitchen remodeling information and products, she added. \n \n\u201cAnd we\u2019re obviously focusing very much on the drought, with landscaping that goes beyond grass,\u201d she said. \n \nJim Gloria of Gloria Landscaping said he can see the future of tiny houses and it is good. His display is next to the five houses on the playing field at the fairgrounds. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s good timing because people need places to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they started being put up, we\u2019ve had people coming by already, every day.\u201d \u00a0", "source": "Auburn Journal"}
