Scott Tamagny.\n\nA witness who wrote down the license plate of the alleged trio's getaway vehicle helped police track the suspects' car to Staten Island, where detective Sgt. Christopher Garris, detective Michael Jennings and officer Sihoon Chung located the vehicle, along with Smith and James and a liquor bottle from the robbery, on Sept. 11.\n\nThe two female suspects were arrested with assistance from the New York Police Department, according to Tamagny.\n\nA day after a warrant was issued for Carmona's arrest, police contacted Carmona via telephone and he surrendered himself at Leonia police headquarters on Sept. 12.\n\nThe three suspects have been charged with robbery, a second-degree crime, and are being held on $100,000 bail with no ten percent option.
