It was instrumental in the development of local travel in the Philippines; suddenly everyone was flying. Would RE/MAX Philippines bring upon the same for the real-estate industry in the Philippines? Real Estate in the Philippines Whether from a friend\u2019s referral or a direct contact, you have been offered a house, a condominium, or any property at least once, formally or otherwise, I suppose. You\u2019ve seen their kiosks and set-up in the malls;\u00a0real estate brokers giving you flyers of their developer\u2019s latest condominiums and community development. Most of these property brokers are from the developers themselves. Their main objective is to sell you their property in the best way they can. And let me clear one thing, there\u2019s nothing bad about that. It\u2019s their job and it\u2019s noble. But sometimes, that property they are selling is not really for you. Your intention might be \u2018for investment\u2018 but the condominium is fit for your residency, or it\u2019s the other way around. My point is that the broker\u2019s desire to make that sale may supersede your best interest. RE/MAX Philippines Team with Franchisees/Brokers RE/MAX Philippines This is where RE/MAX comes in. Ideally as a\u00a0full-service real estate brokerage firm depending on the specific franchise offering, RE/MAX aims to give\u00a0more professional approach to doing real-estate business.
