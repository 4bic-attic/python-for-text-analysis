Seriously, Addiction Proof Your Child is one of 13 books on addiction written by Dr. Peele (who also has a Ph.D., a J.D., and 3 kids, if you doubt his credentials). \u201cBeing preoccupied with telling your children negative things about drugs is the wrong way to go, and it can actually backfire in some cases,\u201d he says. \n\nPeele is an unabashed contrarian on the subject, arguing in his book that the current \u201caddiction is a disease\u201d dogma is wrongheaded, that most kids who use drugs and alcohol don\u2019t become addicted to them, and those who do will often grow out of it. \n\n Peele is an unabashed contrarian on the subject, arguing that the current \u201caddiction is a disease\u201d dogma is wrongheaded.  \n \nThat might sound crazy, but continuing to hope D.A.R.E will protect your kid when it\u2019s proven to not work is actually the definition of crazy. So hear Dr. Peele out \u2014 you might wind up raising a kid with strong willpower who can handle themselves in tricky social situations involving drugs or alcohol. After all, Peele did . \n\nDon\u2019t Focus On Prevention, Focus On Life Skills \n\u201cEncouraging them and allowing them to do constructive things is the best single answer to counteract potentially negative involvements,\u201d Peele says. Take the time you would have spent comparing fried eggs to the brain on crack, and use it to, say, teach them how to throw a knuckleball . \n\nSubstance experimentation is how kids hide from troubles, flirt with the forbidden, or rebel against authority. Addiction requires time spent unproductively, so encouraging your kid to pursue their passions naturally discourages them from pursuing stuff that\u2019s bad for them. That\u2019s just math. \n\nAccept That Your Kid Will Experiment \n\u201cThe odds of your child getting to the age of 21 without drinking or trying marijuana are small,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your plan is, \u2018My child will never use anything,\u2019 that\u2019s no plan.\u201d Your kid doesn\u2019t even have to break the law to get their rocks off \u2014 one in 5 school-age boys at this point is given a prescription to Adderall or a similar amphetamine-like substance, according to Peele. And nearly every kid who\u2019s snapped a bone in half knows the joy of a well-timed painkiller. \n\nWhen ingesting intoxicants is inevitable, learning to do so responsibly is the most important life skill. \u201cThe question becomes how will your child be prepared to deal with such substances, not how can they avoid substances,\u201d Peele says. \n\nRead More \n\nExperience Is The Best Teacher \nThe jury is still out on the effectiveness of giving your kid alcohol early, so Peele won\u2019t recommend or condemn it \u2014 but he allowed his own kids to have wine at civilized family dinners when they were younger because he didn\u2019t want their first experience with booze to involve frat boys and beer bongs. \n\n He didn\u2019t want their first experience with booze to involve frat boys and beer bongs.  \n \nAccording to Peele, experience through independence is what turns kids into confident, competent, and self-respecting adults without addiction problems. He acknowledges that every parent has their own comfort level in this regard, but, \u201cThe more within your value limits and safety limits you can allow a child to try things on, the better prepared that child will be for life.\u201d \n\n[embedded content] \n\nDon\u2019t Panic \nOdds are, a day will come when you find something hidden in your kid\u2019s sock drawer that you wish you hadn\u2019t. If that happens, take a chill pill (even if it means stealing one from your kid\u2019s sock drawer). \u201cMost kids, even if they go too far in that direction, are resilient enough that they will overcome it,\u201d Peele says. \n\nWhat you want to avoid, he says, is a situation in which a kid believes they\u2019ll have to forever grapple with an ongoing addiction when the evidence as he sees it is that, \u201cMost people become more stable as they get older.\u201d \n\nSo, don\u2019t fly off the handle, and don\u2019t jump to conclusions. Focus on steering your kid toward things from which they can derive purpose and enjoyment, and don\u2019t let them feel like a failure when they\u2019re still young \u2014 that\u2019s what standardized testing is for. \n\nMore Stories You\u2019ll Like From Fatherly: \n\n\nHow Some Kids Succeed, Why Others Fail, And Whether Schools Should Be 'Building Character\u2019 \n\n\n5 Things You Should Know About The Law That Might Replace 'No Child Left Behind\u2019 \n\n\nWhy Everything You Think You Know About ADHD May Be Wrong", "source": "Yahoo!
