This marks the second year in a row that the organization\u2019s signature event has been booked to capacity. \n\nA highly regarded lineup has been assembled to underscore the conference\u2019s theme of anticipating future trends while incorporating proven business basics. A pair of keynote speakers anchors the agenda: former Hendrick\u2019s Racing Crew Chief, Ray Evernham and Net Promoter Score (NPS) pioneer and customer satisfaction researcher Fred Reichheld. The knowledge shared by these professionals, combined with the conference\u2019s outstanding mix of general sessions, Conference Plus breakouts, and networking and social opportunities comprise a mix of programs and activities that attendees are finding impossible to resist. \n\n\u201cAs evidenced by our second straight sell out, this year\u2019s theme has struck a chord, because the industry knows it\u2019s more important than ever to get out ahead of \u2018The Next Big Thing\u2019 and adapt accordingly,\u201d stated Fix Auto President and COO Paul Gange. \u201cOur members and franchisees always look forward to coming together alongside our insurance and industry partners, but this year\u2019s focus seems to have created an even greater degree of anticipation. We look forward to participating in what is sure to be a memorable experience and benefit to all who attend.\u201d \n\nTo request an invitation to Fix Auto\u2019s 2016 event, please contact Jonathan Herrera at jherrera@fixauto.com. \n\nAbout Fix Auto: Based in San Diego, California, Fix Auto USA provides a platform which enables independent owner-operated collision repair facilities to achieve success in a consolidating marketplace.
