Neuman from Mad magazine.\n\nI also loved watching him walk in his uniquely primal way, which inspired me to create his alter ego Abbottus Monkus (half man, half ape) for my live Twitter illustrations.\n\nI've also enjoyed drawing him as a hound dog, goat and even a green tree frog - although he probably hated the colour.\n\nThe video was inspired by one of my illustrations for the Herald's Comment pages, where he was drawn as a dinosaur.\n\nOriginally I wanted to parody his stance on the environment and marriage equality, but with yesterday's Liberal leadership spill, we decided to change the ending to include his nemesis.\n\nAs for Malcolm, he's not as comically exciting as Tony, but as they say in politics, anything can happen!\n\nSee a gallery of John Shakespeare's cartoons here and more from Fairfax's cartoonists here. \n\nJohn Shakespeare on Tony Abbott as....\n\n... a green tree frog \n\n...a goat (with the man who has now replaced him as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as a sheep)\n\n...as a hound (with former prime minister Julia Gillard as a fox)\n\n...and as 'Monkus'.", "source": "Sydney Morning Herald"}
