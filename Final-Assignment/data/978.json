Thousands of customers have promised to boycott BrewDog unless the offending video is removed. The video \u2013 called Don\u2019t Make Us Do This \u2013 asks fans of the company to become \u201cinvestors\u201d. In order to \u201cavoid embarrassment\u201d, co-founders James Watt and Martin Dickie then beg viewers not force them into damaging or humiliating experiences. A few examples of said experiences are then given \u2013 such as begging for money on the streets or becoming a trans sex worker. Watt and Dickie are then shown standing in a brothel window in women\u2019s underwear and a wig. Watt and Dickie then say they \u201cneed a bath\u201d. A petition to remove the advert has been issued, stating: \u201cBrewDog beer company claims to be \u2018beer for punks\u2019. They claim to be ethical. \u201cYet in their new crowdsourcing video they mock homeless people, trans women and sex workers.\u201d \u201cThey say, \u2018don\u2019t make us do this\u2019 \u2013 whilst performing as offensive caricatures of people, many of whom already suffer discrimination every day,\u201d the petition adds. \u201cThey are mocking the lives and experiences of people who real punks would be defending and helping.\u201d \u201cWorse, this is a fundraising video \u2013 they\u2019re using these images in an exploitative manner to make money.\u201d One of the petitioners \u2013 Sarah Burns \u2013 said, \u201cNot cool, BrewDog. Not punk, not funny, not ethical, and not cool. \u201cMy husband and I are big fans of your beer but we\u2019ll both be boycotting it until this ad is pulled. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t make us do this'\u201d my f***ing arse. Remember, the rule is punch up, not down.\u201d Last week, it was reported that hundreds of \u201ctransphobic\u201d students walked out of school, after refusing to share a changing room with a fellow pupil because she was trans.
