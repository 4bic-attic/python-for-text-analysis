Because most people have become aware that breathing clean air does matter.\u00a0 \n \nEspecially those who had to breathe wood smoke polluted air from this summer\u2019s wild fires and with the approaching fall and winter season most people are not looking forward being bombarded with smoke emissions from neighbouring fireplaces. \n\r\n\u00a0 \n\r\nPort Coquitlam could be the first municipality on the Lower Mainland to initiate a Bylaw that makes it illegal to pollute neighbourhood air through wood smoke or any other cancer causing smoke. And implementing such law would be a perfect way to come many steps closer to help fulfilling Terry\u2019s Dream to stamp out cancer.\u00a0 \n\r\n\u00a0 \n\r\nBrie Oishi \n\r\nPort Coquitlam", "source": "Castanet.net"}
