When sputter-deposited Sb 2 Te 3 /Bi 2 Te 3 multilayer films were annealed at 400 \u00b0C under a N 2 gas atmosphere, they were transformed into single layers composed of Bi\u2013Sb\u2013Te films. At the same time, they were spontaneously stripped on a large scale from the substrates (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) without chemical etching. The as-fabricated free-standing Bi\u2013Sb\u2013Te films were very flexible, with a thickness of about 400 nm. The findings confirmed that the formation of voids and the strong flow rate of ambient gas play important roles in fabricating free-standing Bi\u2013Sb\u2013Te films during the thermal annealing process. The temperature-dependent crystallization behaviors of each of the Sb 2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Te 3 films were also investigated to understand the mechanism. Moreover, the thermoelectric properties of the free-standing Bi\u2013Sb\u2013Te films were examined with different thicknesses of the films. We believe that this method can contribute to the development of low-dimensional nanostructures that can be useful in various applications such as energy conversion, energy storage and wearable electronics.", "source": "RSC"}
