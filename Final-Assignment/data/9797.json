If it was a school it would be under special measures. \n \n\"It's not fit for practice at the moment. The biggest and best game in the world deserves better - and it's got to do better. There are enough ethical people out there to make sure the job's done properly. \n   Promoted stories   \n\"We need to look at the people, transparency and governance. It needs a whole new broom from top to bottom.\" \n \nBlatter's American lawyer Richard Cullen has insisted \"no mismanagement\" had occurred. \n \nCullen said in a statement: \"Mr Blatter is co-operating and we are confident that when the Swiss authorities have a chance to review the documents and the evidence they will see that the contract was properly prepared and negotiated by the appropriate staff members of FIFA who were routinely responsible for such contracts, and certainly no mismanagement occurred.\" \n \nPlatini said he had clarified matters about the payment with the Swiss authorities after being interviewed as a witness. \n \nThe Frenchman said: \"Regarding the payment that was made to me, I wish to state that this amount relates to work which I carried out under a contract with FIFA and I was pleased to have been able to clarify all matters relating to this with the authorities.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nIn 2005, Blatter signed a contract for World Cup TV rights with the Caribbean Football Union, controlled by Jack Warner. Warner's company later sold the rights on for an \u00a311million profit.", "source": "Haringey Independent"}
