On Wednesday, he said he expected to receive it by the end of the day. \n \nGruden suggested he could wait until game day to announce Washington\u2019s backup. \n \nGriffin lost his starting job to Cousins early last week and has missed Washington's final two preseason games. Gruden had named Griffin this season's starter in February.", "source": "Sportsnet.ca"}
