Through an interpreter, the laughing pope commented,\u00a0\"The tie is the color of hope.\" Boehner replied,\u00a0\"I need a lot of hope today.\" ***** As the Huffington Post website reports on this historic exchange, \u201cThose cameras showed the Ohioan pacing nervously as he waited in his formal office, tugging at his suit buttons and repeatedly adjusting his green tie. \u201cAfter telling Francis how very glad he was the pontiff could come, Boehner sat down with the Pope for their photo op. And explained his tie. \u201cBoehner said he had wanted to wear an older ceremonial blue tie \u2018with the little hands on it,\u2019 but his staff wouldn't let him. \" \u2018My staff insisted I wear the green tie,\u2019 Boehner said. \u201cA member of the pope's entourage said the staff chose well. And through his interpreter, the pontiff himself found a way to elevate the mundane moment a bit. \" \u2018The tie is the color of hope,\u2019 he said. \" \u2018We need a lot of hope today,\u2019 Boehner answered. ***** In a blog post here from 6/13/15, entitled \u201cIt\u2019s easy being the Green One,\u201d I referred to an article called \u201cThe Green Hope,\u201d written by Dr. Terry Watkins, regarding the New Age perversions in Eugene Peterson\u2019s incredibly successful 2002 bible paraphrase (consistently ranked among the top-five bestselling bibles) called \u201cThe Message,\u201d endorsed by such Christian \u201cheavyweights\u201d as Billy Graham, Chuck Swindoll, Rick Warren, Max Lucado, etc., etc. Watkins notes that Romans 15:13 in \u201cThe Message\u201d contains \u201cthe most bizarre statement ever in a mainstream Bible.\u201d The verse reads, \u201cOh! May the God of green hope fill you up with joy, fill you up with peace, so that your believing lives, filled with the life-giving energy of the Holy Spirit, will brim over with hope!\u201d This compares to the King James Bible: \u201cNow the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Watkins writes, \u201cWho is the \u2018God of green hope\u2019? The \u2018green hope\u2019 originated with the hellish, human sacrificing, Druids. The publication Talks on Freemasonry states, \u2018Green was, with the Druids, a symbol of hope and the virtue of hope with a Freemason illustrates the hope of immortality.\u2019 (Kenneth Tuckwood, Talks on Freemasonry). \u201cThe \u2018green hope\u2019 mantra is a popular rallying cry in the new age Mother-Earth environmental movement. In the New Age Movement, \u2018green\u2019 signifies \u2018Oneness with the Earth,\u2019 hence the title of William Anderson\u2019s book, \u2018Green Man: The Archetype of Our Oneness with the Earth.\u2019 \u201d Watkins references page 159 of the \u201cDictionary of Symbolism,\u201d considered the most comprehensive one-volume work on the language of symbols ever published, in which author Hans Biedermann notes:\u00a0 \u201c. . . the devil appears as \u2018the green one\u2019. . .\u201d ***** One of things people love most about the Pope is they believe he has supernatural \u201cconnections\u201d that can directly influence their lives. It comes out of the imagination that says there\u2019s something in all the Catholic hoodleedoo; there\u2019s something in the supernatural that you can\u2019t see except if you come and do it exactly the way they do it. Followers of the icons, rituals, dead saints, etc., etc., try and get something out of the supernatural into their natural life. \u201cThe symbols, the allegories, the imaginations that the world is so full of are designed simply to promote the Lie program,\u201d said Jordan in a recent sermon on man\u2019s religions. \u201cWhat does Satan tell Eve in the Garden? \u2018There\u2019s something that God knows that He doesn\u2019t want you to know that I can tell you, and when you do, you get in contact with the supernatural; you\u2019ll get in contact with something that\u2019s bigger than you are.\u2019 \u201cIn witchcraft, for example, you\u2019re communicating with the spiritual world, trying to get something out of it. Well, Satan has a plan, an enticement to get you involved in that and it\u2019s this hidden stuff. \u201cNow, God makes it all known. In Isaiah 14, when Satan\u2019s original intent is identified for you, his original plan and strategy, there\u2019s a five-point goal he sold to the other angelic host. Satan started at the top echelon and worked his way down. ***** \u201cYou\u2019ve got a worldwide system that\u2019s developing around that curse. An education system, a social system, an economic system, a political system . . . and now we\u2019re \u2018casting off the bands that God\u2019s established.\u2019 \u201cWhen you study marketing, the whole idea is creating a need in someone they didn\u2019t know they have yet. There are hidden meanings in all of merchandising. It\u2019s all done subtly. \u201cWhat did Satan do? He created a need in others for him, but was the need real?! No, he had to trick them. He had to have a \u2018secret\u2019 reason for doing things to entice them in. \u201cWhen Satan comes to attack Eve, she doesn\u2019t even have the basic knowledge of what God told Adam. Now whose fault would that have been? Adam didn\u2019t do his job very well. \u201cIn Verse 4. That\u2019s just a flat-out lie. But she\u2019s not equipped to handle that because her knowledge base isn\u2019t accurate. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s a lie: \u2018for god doth know.\u2019 God knows something you don\u2019t know, Eve, that in the day that th \u201cIn the quote Satan gives to Eve, if you read the words there are 46 words. When you see that phrase \u2018your eyes shall be opened,\u2019 the word \u2018eye\u2019 is the 33rd word in the quote. \u201c \u2018And ye shall be as gods knowing.\u2019 God\u2019s got a secret knowledge out here, Eve, and He\u2019s not telling you about it, but if you\u2019re one of the initiated, you\u2019ll know it. \u201cThirty-three in the Bible is a number associated with illumination. You ever read in the occult about the third eye? You ever seen people going around with a third dot on top of their forehead or a little jewel up there? It\u2019s said to be an \u2018eye of perception.\u2019 This is the ability to see into something and have knowledge that you couldn\u2019t have any other way. It\u2019s secret knowledge that you can only have IF you are in the initiated. \u201cWhere you got to go to be initiated? Satan\u2019s offering it to Eve: \u2018I know something that God doesn\u2019t want you to know and you can\u2019t know unless you become ONE with me.\u2019 \u201cUltimately when the Antichrist and the system that brings him to power is manifested, it\u2019s that MYSTERY (Mystery Babylon the Great). There is a secret purpose; this idea of secret wisdom and hidden understanding, and the gain you can get if you get it, that\u2019s associated with Satan all the way through the Bible. It\u2019s associated with his Lie program. \u201cWhat do you say about a lie? A lie can be 98 percent truth but it\u2019s the two percent that isn\u2019t that kills you. You see, it\u2019s the tares are hidden with the wheat kind of a thing. The Lie program is all this good, good, good, but there\u2019s that secret thing in it. ***** \u201cIsaiah 33:6 is a verse I used to keep posted on my wall: 'And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.\u00a0' If you want the nation to be filled with judgment and righteousness, here it is. \u201cWhen you sit down today and you talk to someone out in the world, you have to start be teaching them the ABCs. Most of you were raised in a culture where everybody knew what the ABCs were. They might not have believed them, but they had a knowledge base in spiritual Bible things that people today don\u2019t have. \u201cIn Hosea 4:6 he told Israel \u2018my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t calculate and make chariots and build buildings. It was knowledge of God. They didn\u2019t have the basic building-block information. \u201cKnowledge is important. Eve didn\u2019t have the knowledge even straight in her thinking, so when Satan came along and offered her this SECRET knowledge, she couldn\u2019t say \u2018NO, I know what the truth is.\u2019 She\u2019s over there dreaming up stuff, leaving stuff out\u2014where\u2019d she get that stuff about \u2018I can\u2019t touch it,\u2019 for example? She made that up in her imagination. \u201cNotice in Deuteronomy 29:29, with God talking to Israel through Moses, everything you need to know to do everything God has for you to do, He revealed to them. ****** \u201cGenesis 5:6 says, \u2018And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\u2019 \u201cThat expression \u2018the imagination of his thoughts,\u2019 you have to understand there are the two sides of the way you think. You have a part of your thinking process that thinks thoughts. It\u2019s the logical side where there\u2019s facts and understanding. \u201cIt\u2019s two plus two equals four. It\u2019s the way you understand things and it\u2019s reason. That\u2019s the realm of your thinking where truth resides, where reality resides, where the facts are \u2018this is the way it is.\u2019 That\u2019s the part of your thinking that\u2019s designed to be in CONTROL. \u201cYou also have an imagination. That\u2019s the creative side of your thinking. That\u2019s the part where you have entrepreneurial kind of ideas. That\u2019s where you have the pictures and you can see yourself doing this or see yourself doing that. You can see something bigger than what reality is. \u201cPoetry and the arts come from there, that kind of thing. Now, that side of your life is where the Lie dwells. Because when you\u2019re thinking something that\u2019s not there, not on the table yet, it can be a good thing, something you can accomplish . . . I often think about people who paint. They put the canvas up there and they see something. A sculptor sees something in a big piece of marble; he just gets rid of all the trash around it. \u201cThe creative side can be good but that\u2019s also the side where the Lie exists. That\u2019s the part of your thinking where the Lie system gets its hook.\u201d ***** \"That word 'vanity' in Romans 8:20 ( 'For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope') means \u2018empty.\u2019 \u00a0 \"When all the substance is gone out of it, you create a vacuum. Satan comes along and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got a plan,\u2019 and it\u2019s sucked right in. People think they\u2019re wise but they\u2019ve become fools. \u201cSatan knows that every time you choose verse 21 (\u2018they glorified him not as God\u2019), they say, \u2018He\u2019s not going to be the one who runs things; I\u2019m going to be the one.\u2019 Now whose philosophy did you just follow? You just bought into Satan\u2019s Lie. You just said your ideas are better than God\u2019s ideas and your \u2018truth\u2019 is better than God\u2019s truth. \u201cThe Lie is you can do it your way: \u2018I\u2019ll run my life.\u2019 You know what that is? That\u2019s an imagination. That\u2019s a vain, worthless, senseless, foolish imagination but you have it anyway. We all do that and if those imaginations aren\u2019t controlled by the truth of God\u2019s Word . . . so Satan works in that program.\"", "source": "Lisa Leland"}
