What problems? \n \nInvestors appear to have put aside worries over a slowdown in the world\u2019s second biggest economy, giving a boost to global markets on Wednesday. \n \nEuropean markets opened with gains of about 2%, but Japan\u2019s Nikkei was the standout performer, adding 7.7% in its best day since the global financial crisis. \n \nThe enthusiasm was infectious in Asia. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 4%, Taiwan\u2019s main index gained 3.6% and India\u2019s Sensex was trading 1.7% higher. \n \nIn China, the Shanghai Composite advanced for a second straight day, gaining 2.3% on signs that Beijing is considering further measures to boost the economy. \n \nThe massive rally in Japan pushed the Nikkei back into positive territory for the year. As the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar, exporters including Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor all gained more than 6%. \n \nFast Retailing, best known as the owner of clothing brands Uniqlo and Theory, advanced 10%. The retailer is by far the largest component of the Nikkei index. \n \nThere was no obvious reason for the index\u2019s dramatic rise. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did propose a mild corporate tax cut on Wednesday, according to Reuters, but investors have expected the move since last year. There were no major economic data releases or policy actions. \n \nThe most likely explanation is that after weeks of volatile trading, investors are optimistic that central banks and governments will soon roll out more stimulus measures in a bid to support growth. \n \nAnd pressure continues to build on the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates this month \u2014 the World Bank\u2019s chief economist Kaushik Basu told the Financial Times the Fed should hold off or risk triggering \u201cpanic and turmoil\u201d in emerging markets. \n \nChina figures prominently in this equation. Analysts are concerned that the country\u2019s growth is slowing more quickly than expected, leading to market jitters around the world. \n \nThe People\u2019s Bank of China has already cut interest rates, and lowered the amount of cash banks are required to keep on hand. The central bank has also allowed the biggest devaluation of the yuan in decades, which should provide a boost to exporters. \n \nBeijing has the ability to roll out even more stimulus, if required. \n \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r \r Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show' lights up late night TV", "source": "GantDaily.com"}
