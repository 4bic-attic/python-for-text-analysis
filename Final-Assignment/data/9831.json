But if you met Shahadah \u2013 a bubbly 17-year-old with large brown eyes, long dark hair, a sparkly smile and a penchant for sending emoji-filled texts \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t know it.\n\nRather than dish out details of her battle with cancer, Shahadah would tell you about the tilapia with baked beans and yellow rice she cooked the night before. Or about the restaurant she planned to open one day. Shahadah would even point out that she already owned an apron and chef\u2019s hat with her name on it.\n\n\u201cI want to actually wear it and cook in it in a restaurant,\u201d she told The News in an interview earlier this summer. \u201cNot just have it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Shahadah died after a fight with cancer that spanned most of her teen years. She is survived by her mother, Darcella James, sisters Raivin James and Krystal Perkins, and best friend Kenshasae Pringle. Her life will be celebrated Friday with a 1 p.m. wake and 2 p.m. funeral at St. Luke\u2019s Mission of Mercy, 325 Walden Ave., Buffalo.\n\nShahadah\u2019s cancer first surfaced in 2012, when a bump on her knee was diagnosed as osteosarcoma. Through a long battle that included knee replacement, chemotherapy and lung surgery, Shahadah beat the disease once, and then again, and even a third time.\n\nBut last March \u2013 six months ago \u2013 the cancer returned. Doctors gave Shahadah a choice: Undergo a high-risk lung surgery that, given her weakened heart, she may not survive. \n\nOr, in her words, \u201cnot get surgery and just wait until the cancer takes over my body.\u201d\n\nFriends say Shahadah was rooted in her honest, almost blunt acceptance of her situation.\n\n\u201cShahadah never let on about the suffering or pain she was going through,\u201d said Emily Marciniak, who was program coordinator for Teens Living with Cancer at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and now works with the American Cancer Society\u2019s Relay for Life program. \u201cEven when she received the news that she didn\u2019t have much time left, she never lost hope, and her spirit didn\u2019t change. She always dreamed and talked about her future.\u201d\n\nWhen Shahadah became too sick to attend school and spent most days in her East Side home, she watched the Food Network and became a devoted fan of Rachael Ray. Last May, through the P.U.N.T. Foundation, she was scheduled to fly to New York City, attend a taping of Ray\u2019s show and meet the TV star. But days before the trip, Shahadah\u2019s doctors determined she was too sick to fly.\n\nInstead, Ray sent flowers, a card and a personalized 30-second video message.\n\n\u201cEveryone says you\u2019re one of my biggest fans,\u201d Ray said. \u201cWow, that is so cool! I just wanted you to know that I am your biggest fan.\u201d\n\nIn June, Shahadah\u2019s dreams of wearing her chef\u2019s hat and apron came true when the P.U.N.T. Foundation arranged for her to cook alongside Chris Machols, executive chef at the Embassy Suites Buffalo, where she also stayed overnight with her family.\n\nAfterward, P.U.N.T.\u2019s executive director Gwen Mysiak texted Shahadah a couple of photos from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Shahadah responded, naming all the people involved in making the wish happen. \u201c(You) let me have a very unforgettable experience.\u201d\n\nShadahah added a red-heart emoji and the words \u201cI love you,\u201d followed by a smiley face with another heart.\n\n\u201cShahadah was one of those kids who expressed her love and gratitude so willingly,\u201d Mysiak said. \u201cShe never let cancer define her and she kept her zest for life and all it had to offer until the very end. She wanted to soak up every second she had.\u201d\n\nemail: toshei@buffnews.com", "source": "Buffalo News"}
