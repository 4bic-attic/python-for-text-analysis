Eastern Sierra Nevada, California. August 7, 2015. \u00a9 Copyright 2015 G Dan Mitchell \u2013 all rights reserved. \n \nAfternoon light and haze, clearing storm clouds, eastern Sierra Nevada \n \nIn early August I was (of course!) once again in the Sierra for several days. This time the main event was to be a short backpacking trip with long-time back-country friends \u2014 a \u201ctaking it easy\u201d trip to a beautiful group of lakes in the Rock Creek drainage. Our plan was to meet on at the trailhead or on the trail, to do the short hike to a central lake, set up a base camp, and relax and explore for a few days. \n \nI decided to head up early, partly to have a bit of time to adapt the elevation, but also to do a bit of photography. (My backpacking partners were more \u201cnormal\u201d people \u2014 not \u201cabnormal\u201d photograph-obsessed folks like me!) Arriving in the Yosemite high country at noon on a Friday in August, I did not spend much time at all trying to find a campsite there, instead heading straight over the crest and down to a less crowded spot. With camp set up, it was time to go make some photographs. Taking advantage of my east side location, I decided to head south a short distance along US 395, where I could find beautiful vistas of high desert terrain rising to the crest of the Sierra Nevada, augmented on this day by dissipating storm clouds and a bit of haze from early season wildfires. \n  \nG Dan Mitchell is a California photographer and visual opportunist.\u00a0His book, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Fall Color: A Photographer\u2019s Guide to Autumn in the Sierra\u201d is available from Heyday Books and Amazon . \n Blog | About | Flickr | Twitter | Facebook |\u00a0 Google+ | 500px.com | LinkedIn | Email \n  \nAll\u00a0media \u00a9 Copyright G Dan Mitchell and others as\u00a0indicated.
