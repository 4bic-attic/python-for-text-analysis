More . \n Nicholas Birrell  \nName: Nicholas Birrell \nAge: 29 \nGender: Male \nState: VIC \nKnown for: LOKE GROUP \n \nNicholas Birrell is what you would call a jack of all trades. Aside from managing the LOKE Group, a business that specialises in technology, marketing, and branding, what makes Nicholas stand out from his contemporaries is that he is also passionate about the healthcare and biotechnology industries. \n \nHe co-founded Wellend Health and Chavah Biotech, which have produced patents that reduce the risk of breast cancer. During his downtime, he is a wine connoisseur, having helped create a boutique wine label called Doghouse Wines. \n \nIn the past 5 years he has built 5 companies across the fields of technology, branding & marketing, healthcare, biotechnology and viticulture. And in that short time, he has collectively raised $3m in private investments, $1m in public grants, and $10m in revenues. \n \nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth-sailing for Nicholas, however. He recounts one stumbling block which he overcame recently: \u201cI have had too many setbacks to count but my biggest was probably when I lost my CTO to his own business. I had to learn all about our technology and get out there on the engineering networking circuit.\u201d \n \nEven more remarkable than this adaptability is Nicholas\u2019 capacity to handle businesses across fields that are so different from each other. When asked why he has chosen these particular industries to put his stamp on, he has this to say: \u201cI am passionate about creating a world in which things that matter are done better. I would like to be in a constant state of growth, with science and technology as my medium and commerce as my delivery mechanism. I am great at turning ideas into commercial and viable realities.\u201d \n \nNow, Anthill is pleased to announce Nicholas Birrell, 2015 30under30 winner. \n  Anthill asks:\u00a0Nicholas Birrell, what\u2019s your super power?  \n\u201cMy super power is the ability to foresee what is around the corner.
