Use a Monster or Robot Here is my Design Team project... I sure do like using these Tim Holtz distress inks! So many color combinations and patterns you can create...lots of fun too! I love the watercolor background with the monster on top. I used Sunset orange, black, and citrus colored skittles. Then I cut this cute girlie monster from Miss Kate Cuttables\u00a0on my Cameo. It is actually from a set of 3 different monsters!
