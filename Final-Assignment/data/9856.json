In order to not appear as if it\u2019s favoring a specific candidate, it invites all of them to speak at its convocation program, which is held twice a week and is mandatory for students that live on campus. This is the same event where Ted Cruz announced his presidential campaign.\n\nSanders is the first Democratic candidate to ever accept the Liberty University\u2019s invitation.\n\nHe began his speech by saying that he understands his views don\u2019t align with the general beliefs held at Liberty. He goes on to say that politicians tend to speak in front of people who do agree with them, but it is also important to engage in a civil discourse with those who have opposing opinions. He says, \"It is important to see where if possible \u2014 and I do believe it\u2019s possible \u2014 where we can find common ground.\"\n\nMost of his speech centered around morality and income inequality, which he spoke about in the context of the Bible.", "source": "Fortune"}
