Additionally I'm not sure whether I should use the A1A-trucks of USA-Trains as a substitute. There are a few differences in appearance between the the 1B (asymmetrical axle distance, about 14' 6\" wheelbase) and the A1A (symmetrical axle distance, app. 15'6\" wheelbase).\nPictures of first assembly will follow", "source": "large-scale diesel models"}
