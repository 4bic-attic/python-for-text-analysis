As part of the National Eye Donation Fortnight, Narayana Nethralaya and its two eye banks: Dr Rajkumar Eye Bank in Rajajinagar and Dr Shankaranand Eye Bank in Electronic City conducted the Drishti Santhe which evolved around the theme \u2018Of the Blind, For the Blind\u2019. \n\nIt included cultural performances, elocution contests, painting competitions, story telling, fancy dress competition and quiz competitions organised for the visually challenged people. They participated with other normal school children across Bengaluru, but also exhibited their skills in hand made artificial flowers, different products and services for persons with vision impairment including braille education kits. \n\n\u201cEvery year during this fortnight, we conduct events and awareness programmes to encourage pledging and to dispel misconceptions. There are hundreds of visually challenged people who wait with a thin ray of hope of them getting sight through a sensible donor,\u201d said\u00a0 Dr. K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman & managing director, Narayana Nethralaya. \n\n\u201cIn 2014, we collected a record 1,372 eyes which is much more than 1/3rd of the total eye collection in the state and have been part of this\u00a0 noble cause since 1982,\u201d he added. \n\nThe National Fortnight on Eye Donation is celebrated nationally. According to the medical history, it is observed that about 20,000 new cases of the eye blindness are added every year. The majority of blind people are young due to injuries, infections, deficiency of vitamin A , malnutrition, congenital or other factors. But their eye sight can be restored through corneal transplantation only. So it has become very necessary to educate the people of the society including both young and old to cover the gap between demand and supply of the cornea. \n\nAccording to 2012 study, one in five blind people globally is from India which is around 1.5 crore people. However the rate of eye donation is only 35,000 eyes which cannot fulfill the need. There is a large gap between the process of demand and supply of the eyes, said Dr. Shetty.", "source": "PharmaBiz"}
