This is hard to read and annoys readers. \n\nYou have issues with a business. Have a bad meal? Feel you were overcharged at the store? New car is a lemon? Contact the business directly with your customer service concerns. \n\nYou included an e-mail address or phone number, pretended to be someone you aren't or offered a comment that makes no sense. \n\nYou accused someone of a crime or assigned guilt or punishment to someone suspected of a crime. \n\nYour comment is in really poor taste.", "source": "Montana Standard"}
