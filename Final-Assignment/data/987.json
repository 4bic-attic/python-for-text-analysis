He aced separate charges of assault, driving with excess breath-alcohol and careless driving. \n \nThe most serious charges arose from an incident that took place on March 23, at the Eyre River crossing in Downs Rd, near Rangiora. \n \nMcDaniel was driving a dark-grey four-wheel-drive Nissan. \n \nA man out walking the family's 10-month-old puppy, with his wife and two children at about 5.45pm, signalled to McDaniel to slow down when he drove out of the river crossing. \n \nMcDaniel then manoeuvred the car with a series of u-turns to try to knock the man down. \n \nThe man tried to avoid the vehicle by jumping over a fence but was struck and then the puppy was hit by the car as it drove away from the scene. \n \nThe man received treatment for cuts to his hands from the fence, cuts and bruises on his head and injuries to his shoulder and ankle. The puppy was put down.\u00a0 \n    \n\u00a0", "source": "The Press NZ"}
