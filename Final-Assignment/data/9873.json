Zodiac signs \u2014 the sole determinant of your kid\u2019s behavioral traits  \nWhen my son\u2019s due date fell in late June, I received many interesting raised-eyebrow looks from folks, who would then state, rather ominously,\u00a0 \u201cHmm \u2026 he may be a Gemini. Interesting.\u201d \n \nI would respond,\u00a0 \u201cWhy?! What?! What\u2019s the deal with Geminis? Tell me \u2014 no really, tell me.\u201d \n \nThey would leave me with a giggle, followed by,\u00a0 \u201cOh, not to worry, Geminis are just \u2018curious\u2019 children.\u201d \n \nI would then ask Google what it all means, and I was met with the following traits laughing at me in bold, \u201cCurious, dramatic, inconsistent, and impatient.\u201d \n \nWell, isn\u2019t that all children? \n \nWhile my own Taurean traits are pretty spot-on (except the stubborn part \u2014 obviously), I had to fight the urge to label my child with particular characteristics before he was even born. \n \nHe ended up being born on the Gemini-Cancer cusp, and the Internet said,  \u201cIf you were born on the Gemini-Cancer cusp, you\u2019re a magical individual! The energies of Gemini and Cancer combine to create truly inspirational human beings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0both lighthearted and fun, but also caring and devoted.\u201d \n \nI decided to believe it \u2014 the Internet never lies. \n 2. Full moon \u2014 why so many women went into labor last night  \nBesides the obvious (that certain people turn into werewolves on the night of a full moon), it is also believed that we humans have heightened brain activity when the moon is exposed in all its glory. \n \nWomen also have more babies during a full moon, supposedly. No, a twin doesn\u2019t suddenly materialize from nowhere, but more women go into labor. It\u2019s like the cervix of all full-term preggos are inspired to open wide when the moon shows its full face. If you\u2019re an on-call labor and delivery nurse on the night of a full moon, sleep in your scrubs. \n 3. Super moon \u2014 the reason your kid is having wild dreams  \n(AKA: a really big full moon that occurs when the moon is making its closest approach to Earth during orbit.) \n \nSuperstition says that a super moon causes a greater chance of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but in my house it mainly means my child won\u2019t go to sleep until midnight because it\u2019s so bright in his room, he has wild dreams, and he will only want to eat green grapes the next day, go figure. \n \nA very real effect of the super moon, in addition to my son\u2019s increase in green grape intake, is that the tides rise \u2014 so there\u2019s that. In addition, it is believed that there is an increase in spiritual energies, creating opportunities for growth and increased perception. \n \nTake away: be prepared for wild enlightening dreams, less sand and more water at the beach, a craving for grapes, and your period will probably start, because why not. \n 4. Blue moon \u2014 a mom\u2019s excuse to go get a massage  \nWith an auspicious twinkle in her eye,\u00a0my mom has often told me I was born on the night of a full moon, in the month of a blue moon. I always ooed and ahhed when she told me this, but had no idea why it mattered. \n \nI\u2019ve now learned that a blue moon is the rare happening when two full moons show up in one month \u2014 at the very beginning and very end. And yes, I know you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow,\u00a0Bailey! Born the night of a full moon in the month of a blue moon?! Wow!\u201d I know \u2014 pretty cool. \n \nMany astrologers view the month of a blue\u00a0moon as an opportunity to contemplate the big \u201cstuff\u201d in life and use it as a gentle reminder to make some changes. I love it. No one is saying magical martians are going to come down and fill your physical and spiritual bank account with celestial gold, but maybe it can serve as a mother\u2019s impetus to take some alone time, write in a journal, or (gasp!) go get a massage. Maybe from one of those magical martians. \n 5. Mercury retrograde \u2014 why your life feels\u00a0suddenly \u201coff\u201d  \nThis is when Mercury appears to be moving backward and everything goes haywire. If you\u2019re reading this while Mercury is in retrograde (hint: you are ), turn on Curious George for the kiddos, and go buy this . \n \n*** \n \nWhile I\u2019m not fully submerged in the waters of all things astrological, I do receive a daily horoscope from a source that tells me more than, \u201cToday,\u00a0a mysterious stranger will come into your life while buying oranges.\u201d I also have my son\u2019s horoscope sent to me.\u00a0Although I don\u2019t view these astrological predictions as gospel (that\u2019s what my favorite online mom blogs are for), I do see them as gentle reminders to be aware of the bigger picture for both my life, and my son\u2019s. \n \nAnd if it tells me I might hit some \u201cchallenging financial times\u201d in the upcoming year,\u00a0I sell all my stocks and cancel my Netflix subscription. Just kidding \u2014 I would never cancel Netflix, it would go against my gospel. \n \nThe post appeared first on Babble .", "source": "Babble"}
