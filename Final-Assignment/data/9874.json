Mike Pence approved a religious objections law. Opponents said the law would sanction discrimination against the LGBT communities, leading lawmakers to make changes. \n\nOesterle was a vocal opponent of the law and says new LGBT protections are crucial for tech firms to recruit talented workers. \n\nOesterle says members of Tech for Equality will be announced in the coming weeks.", "source": "Miami Herald"}
