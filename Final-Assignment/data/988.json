The last time I played for the Warriors, most of us were coming from off-season and that could have contributed to the jittery performance. However, I\u2019m not bitter at all that the coaches have overlooked me because I understand the coach (Callisto Pasuwa) has his plans and the guys called are capable of getting the country the much needed positive result. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be back in the national team and will continue working hard,\u201d said Nakamba. \n \nThe 21-year-old former Njube High School pupil said he would continue training at his base during the Fifa calendar weekend break. \n \nPasuwa named what appears on paper to be a strong side, but his preparations for weekend game against Guinea took off at a snail\u2019s pace as most foreign-based players are stuck at their bases waiting for Zifa to send them air tickets. \n \nMidfielders who will do duty this weekend include the South African-based trio of Willard Katsande, Khama Billiat and Kuda Mahachi. \n \nOf the three, only Mahachi, who was not registered by Mamelodi Sundowns, has not played competitive football in the last four weeks, but has only been training with the Chloorkop side. \n \nMahachi\u2019s stellar performance against South Africa last month in Pietermaritzburg during the Under-23 Caf Championships clash, could be the reason the ginger-haired midfielder was called up. \n \nDanish-based midfielder Quincy Antipas has been ruled out and replaced by Dynamos\u2019 Ronald Chitiyo. \n \nChicken Inn\u2019s captain Danny \u201cDeco\u201d Phiri is the other locally-based midfielder called up for national duty.", "source": "Zimbabwe Chronicle"}
