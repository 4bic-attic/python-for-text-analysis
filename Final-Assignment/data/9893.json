The company says it has more than 1.5 million listings \u2014 homes, apartments, guest rooms, even houseboats and tree houses \u2014 in more than 34,000 cities in 190 countries. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a global phenom,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures who made an early personal investment in Airbnb in 2010. \u201c(It) is going to continue to grow at a substantially higher rate than other businesses.\u201d \n \nUnlike hotels, Airbnb does not own properties and is not responsible for services like housekeeping. \n \nThe research arm of investment bank Piper Jaffray estimated earlier this year that the service would have about 61 million nightly bookings in 2015.\u00a0 \n \nIts growth comes despite Airbnb\u2019s ongoing battle with regulators and lawmakers over who can list properties and how they should be zoned and taxed. \n \nIn its hometown of San Francisco, a proposed law on the November ballot would limit the use of homes as hotels through services such as Airbnb. \n \nSupporters of the law argue that Airbnb exacerbates the city\u2019s brutal housing shortage. \n \nSome travelers prefer to use Airbnb not just for the cheaper price but also options such as renting an entire house, enjoying quiet neighborhoods lacking in hotels and benefiting from their host\u2019s local knowledge. \n \nTravel industry analysts say the growth rate suggests Airbnb\u2019s push in Europe and efforts to win over business travelers are succeeding. \n \n\u2013 Contact us at [email\u00a0protected] \n \nCG \n Download EJI Mobile Apps", "source": "EJ Insights"}
