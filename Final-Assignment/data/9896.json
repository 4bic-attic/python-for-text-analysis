I think all of our moms have told us that,\u201d he in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAll of these candidates are going to have to account for their own words.\u201d \n\nBut Priebus downplayed concerns that the eventual Republican nominee will be hampered by other GOP contenders\u2019 comments from primary season. \n\nHe pointed to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s famous stumbles in which he suggested much of the country is too dependent on government to vote for a Republican and called for undocumented immigrants to remove themselves from the United States. \n\n\u201cIf you go back to 2012, it wasn\u2019t anything another candidate said,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWhether it be the \u201847%\u2019 or whether it be \u2018self-deportation,\u2019 it was the nominee\u2019s words that came back into play. So look, I think at the end of the day, each candidate\u2019s going to be accountable for their own words and their own mouths, and so they should proceed with caution.\u201d \n\nSince Romney\u2019s defeat, national Republicans have identified the party\u2019s rhetoric toward Latinos and on issues important to those voters \u2014 immigration, in particular \u2014 as crucial to the party\u2019s prospects in presidential elections. \n\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump courted controversy this summer with his attacks on undocumented immigrants and his claim that he\u2019d build an impenetrable wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Other candidates, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, joined Trump in questioning the right of birthright citizenship, while the GOP\u2019s second-place contender in recent polls, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, said he\u2019d use drones to patrol the border. \n\nThe interview came as Tapper and CNN prepare to host the second Republican presidential debate Wednesday night from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \n\nPriebus said while Republicans are happy to live in the United States, it\u2019s tough for many to feel the optimism of Reagan\u2019s era today. \n\n\u201cEach era has a different feeling,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAnd I think at this point, a lot of people around the country are concerned about their futures.\u201d", "source": "77 WABC RADIO"}
