(\"HaiKe\" or \"the Company\" or \"the Group\"), the AIM quoted (AIM: HAIK) specialty chemical based in Shandong Province, China, today announces its unaudited consolidated results for the six months ended 30 June 2015. \n\nFinancial highlights \n\n-- Total revenues decreased by 16.2% to CNY385.4 million (H1 2014: CNY460.0 million) -- Gross profit decreased by 11.8% to CNY41.5 million (H1 2014: profit of CNY 47.0 million) -- Profit for the period from continuing operations was CNY95,000 (H1 2014: loss of CNY361,000) despite economic slowdown and increased competition \n\n-- Cash and cash equivalents balance as at 30 June 2015 was CNY43.6 million (31 December 2014: CNY CNY39.4 million) \n\n-- Bank loans decreased significantly by 77.3% to CNY182.4 million at 30 June 2015 (31 December 2014: CNY702.9 million) reflecting an improvement in operating cash; bank loans further reduced post period end to CNY152.4 million as at 31 August 2015 \n\nOperational highlights \n\n-- Despite improvements in product mix and cost control, the collapse of the crude oil price in H1 2015 has depressed the selling prices of downstream derivative products and affected most of HaiKe's specialty chemical products \n\n-- Lower selling prices and increased competition in a highly price-sensitive market has reduced margins, particularly for mid to lower-end specialty chemicals \n\n-- Planned shutdown of the Group's principal production facility for maintenance and upgrade to counteract increased competition \n\nOutlook \n\n-- Continued focus on increasing our sales and marketing campaign and tightening costs further \n\n-- Optimization of product mix in the short-term is under way -- External economic factors have affected revenues and margins for HaiKe's principal products, in particular DiMethyl Carbonate and Isopropyl Alcohol. As previously announced, the Directors believe the Group is at risk of not achieving a profit for the full year 2015 \n\n-- The Board is considering options to counteract recent economic and market developments in order to optimise performance \n\nMr. Xiaohong Yang, Executive Chairman, said: \n\n\"The Group has delivered a modest profit despite facing a number of challenges in the period, many of which are outside our control. The weak crude oil price reduced our selling prices which, in turn, eroded our margins and we faced stiff competition for our mid to lower-end products. During the period, we shut down our major production facility for essential maintenance and upgrade works in order to ensure we retain our competitive advantage against a difficult backdrop. Looking forward, we are focused on increasing our sales and marketing campaigns and tightening costs further, as well as improving our product mix and formulating a sustainable earnings model in the long run. In light of difficult market conditions, the Board is evaluating options to optimise performance and will announce more detailed plans on this in due course. \n\nIndicative exchange rates as at 24 September 2015: GBP(GBP)1: CNY 9.75 \n\nSource:www.oanda.com \n\nFor further information please contact: \n\nGeorge Zeng, Chief Financial HaiKe Chemical Officer Group george@HaiKechemical.com +86 138 2520 2570 Antonio Bossi / Richard Westhouse Securities Johnson +44 (0) 20 7601 6100 Shan Shan Willenbrock / Tom Horsman Cardew Group HaiKe@cardewgroup.com +44 (0) 20 7930 0777 The Interim Results are being sent to shareholders and will be available shortly from the Company's website www.haikechemical.com. CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 1. Review of operating results The price of crude oil fell dramatically in H1 2015 and average price was approximately $59.4 per barrel, 45.4% lower than that one year previously. The resultant negative impact on the selling prices of derivative products, including most of HaiKe's specialty chemical products, in turn led to margin erosion, particularly for mid to lower-end products. \n\nIn H1 2015, the Group sold 63,000 tons of specialty chemicals, representing a volume gain of 5.1% when compared to the same period in the previous year. However, the average realized price for specialty products decreased by 18.9% year-on-year. \n\nSales Volume Average Realised Price ('000 ton) (CNY/ton) 6 months 6 months Change 6 months 6 months Change ended ended y-o-y ended ended y-o-y 30-Jun-15 30-Jun-14 (%) 30-Jun-15 30-Jun-14 (%) DiMethyl Carbonate 23 21 +8.3% 3,872 5,155 -24.9% Propylene glycol 19 17 +6.9% 8,705 9,207 -5.4% Isopropyl alcohol 19 20 -2.3% 5,726 8,251 -30.6% Diisopropyl ether 2 1 +39.5% 11,319 12,372 -8.5% ----------- ----------- ------- ----------- ----------- ------- Total 63 60 +5.1% 6,119 7,544 -18.9% 2. Financial Analysis Turnover The Group's sales turnover decreased by 16.2% to CNY385.4 million for the first half of 2015 (H1 2014: CNY460.0 million) as a result of a reduction in selling prices and trading activity. Trading revenues from HaiKe Trading decreased to CNY21.7 million in the period (H1 2014: CNY29.1 million). \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross profit was CNY41.5 million for H1 2015, down 11.8% compared with the same period in 2014 (H1 2014: CNY47.0 million). The fall in gross profit was mainly attributable to the reduction in selling prices despite a gain in sales volume. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nSelling and distribution expenses increased by 5.4% to CNY17.5 million in H1 2015 (H1 2014: CNY16.6 million) as we continued with aggressive sales and marketing efforts to counteract sluggish market conditions. General and administrative expenses increased to CNY20.0 million (H1 2014: CNY13.9 million) which was mainly attributable to an increase in labour cost as a result of an increase in domestic inflation. \n\nNet Interest Expenses \n\nInterest income increased by 118.4% year-on-year to CNY2.9 million for H1 2015 (H1 2014: CNY1.3 million) due to exchange rate gains. \n\nInterest expenses decreased by 61.8% year-on-year to CNY6.3 million for H1 2015 (H1 2014: CNY16.4million). This was mainly due to a decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding. \n\nProfit Before Taxation \n\nProfit before taxation was CNY666,000 for H1 2015 (H1 2014: CNY1.4 million). \n\nIncome Tax \n\nIncome tax charge was CNY571,000 for H1 2015, as compared to CNY1.8 million for the same period in the previous year. \n\nProfit from Continuing Operations \n\nProfit for the half year was CNY95,000 for H1 2015 (H1 2014: loss of CNY361,000). \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to CNY43.6 million as at 30 June 2015 compared to CNY39.4 million as at 31 December 2014. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the movement in working capital, which was more than enough to offset the reduction of bank loans. \n\nBank Loans \n\nBank loans decreased significantly to CNY182.4 million as at 30 June 2015, as compared to CNY702.9 million as at 31 December 2014. The decrease in bank loans was an encouraging step forward in order to reduce financial risk on the back of a positive move of operating cash flow in H1 2015. \n\nCash Flow from Continuing Operations \n\nCash flow from operating activities was CNY531.9million for the six months ended 30 June 2015, compared to a negative cash flow of CNY562.8 million for the same period in the previous year. This was mainly attributable to improvements in working capital. 3. Outlook The macro economy remains challenging. The collapse in the crude oil price has made conditions difficult for the specialty chemicals industry in China and the domestic economy has had a negative impact on demand. At the industry level we are facing increasing competition, particularly at the mid to lower end of the market, and we believe companies will increasingly have to develop their own niche through technological innovation to deliver growth. \n\nTo ensure we are able to deliver positive earnings, the Company intends to continue to \n\n-- upgrade current production facilities in order to retain its competitive edge -- improve product mix, tighten cost control, and strengthen sales and marketing efforts -- introduce new lines of products and formulate a viable earnings model from technological innovation. \n\nAs previously indicated in a trading statement announcement on 14 September 2015, The Group recorded a loss in July and August 2015 as a result of continuing challenging conditions and a planned shutdown of a production facility which manufactures DMC. The Group recorded a loss of CNY1.3 million and CNY3.0 million for July and August respectively. \n\nHowever, the Group continued to generate cash and the bank loan balance has been further reduced to CNY152.4 million as at 31 August 2015. \n\nXiaohong Yang \n\nExecutive Chairman \n\nConsolidated statement of comprehensive income \n\n(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2015 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\n\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2015 \n\n6 months ended 6 months ended Year ended 30-Jun-15 30-Jun-14 31-Dec-14 Note (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Audited) CNY'000 CNY'000 CNY'000 ------------------- -------------------- ----------- Revenue 385,427 460,042 973,345 Cost of sales (343,960) (413,032) (869,471) ------------------- -------------------- ----------- Gross profit 41,467 47,010 103,874 Other operating income 112 21 263 Administrative expenses (19,978) (13,895) (29,751) Selling and distribution expenses (17,514) (16,610) (39,955) ------------------- -------------------- ----------- Profit from operations 4,087 16,526 34,431 Finance expenses (6,286) (16,447) (38,557) Finance income 2,865 1,312 12,844 ------------------- -------------------- ----------- Profit / (loss) before tax 666 1,391 8,718 Tax expense 4 (571) (1,752) (1,142) (Loss) / Profit for the period from continuing operations 95 (361) 7,576 Loss for the period from discontinuing operations -
