The official OTA (Over the Air) Android 5.0 Lollipop update features several upgrades and bug fixes over the existing operating system version Android 4.4 Kitkat.\n\nFor upgrading to Android 5.0 Lollipop, owners of A6000 and A6000 Plus should navigate to SettingsAbout Phone tab and tap the System Updates option. The update file is huge in size and hence it is suggested that they connect to a Wi-Fi network before updating their device. They should also ensure the battery in their device is sufficiently charged.\n\nBoth A6000 and A600 Plus offer a decent combination of features, multimedia performance and battery efficiency. The Lenovo A6000 and the A6000 Plus are available exclusively through Flipkart.\n\nThe A6000 Plus features processor, display, camera and battery similar to A6000 but packs double the RAM and device storage. The A6000 Plus is now available for Rs 7,499.\n\nAccording to the IDC\u2019s Asia-Pacific Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, Q2, 2015 ( August 2015 release), Lenovo has emerged as the biggest 4G smartphone brand in India with a 29.4% share of the 4G smartphone market. Lenovo is leading the market with its aggressively priced 4G LTE smartphone portfolio, with over a million 4G devices sold during Q2, 2015. Lenovo has sold 1.3 million units of A6000 and A6000 Plus till date.\n\nThe other two Lenovo devices in the budget category, the A7000 and the K3 Note, run on Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box and hence, after the official OTA release for the A6000 and the A6000 Plus, all Lenovo budget smartphones will run on Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system.", "source": "EFYTimes.com"}
