You can read all about what it\u2019s rumored to be able to do at the source link below. \n \nWith XFinity and Amazon working on streaming gaming and dropping other-device requirements to stream (Amazon has it\u2019s own remote,) hopefully Chromecast2 will have some ability to\u00a0interface with controllers other than an Android, iPhone, or computer. \n \nIf Google\u2019s\u00a0history repeats itself again, we can expect to see this device released shortly after the announcement, followed by being rooted,\u00a0that root exploit being patched, another root method\u00a0coming along, then about a year before the features that the Chromecast2 will tout before it comes to everyone, and then it\u2019ll explode. \n \nOr maybe they learned last time. \n \nWhatever the case, it\u2019s all rumors, so this weekend post some rumors of your own for the Chromecast 2, I\u2019ll start: new embedded microphone listens for when you\u2019re trying to figure out what you want for dinner, and based on your Netflix or Google Play Video queue local Pizza or Indian places will \u201caccidentally\u201d\u00a0call you asking if you want delivery. \n \n[ 9to5Google ] \n \nNew Chromecast rumored to be released shortly by Paul E King first appeared on Pocketables .", "source": "Pocketables"}
