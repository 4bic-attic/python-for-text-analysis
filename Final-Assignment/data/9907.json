A $1000 a week drug habit and the need to transport drugs and weapons to fuel it was the breaking point for one Margaret River resident at 20 years-of-age. It all began for Nate when he was encouraged to smoke cannabis by some older friends in high school.\n\nHe was drawn in quickly after seeing their lifestyle which he found appealing.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re an addict, you\u2019re always an addict. You\u2019re just not using.\u201d - Nate \n\nHe began selling cannabis at school to his mates and was told he would earn more money if he dabbled into selling ecstasy and more illicit drugs.\n\nAfter finding out he would earn more money selling further north, he started to travel there twice a week.\n\nIt was then he began to sample what he was selling.\n\nHe was 20 when he realised how severe his addiction had become.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you see how they glamorise it on TV and to an extent, it is the lifestyle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour body says you\u2019ve got to stop.\u201d\n\nSearching for help, he was told before he could enter a rehabilitation program he needed to have the drugs out of his system.\n\nNate couldn\u2019t see any where else to go but to the bush.\n\nHe spent four days there vomiting and hallucinating while the drugs left his body.\n\n\u201cI did it by myself; in hindsight I should have had someone with me,\u201d Nate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never, ever going back to that lifestyle again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 10 years since Nate has detoxed and has tried to be a positive voice in the community.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance I caused a lot of addictions like my own,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Nate, addiction didn\u2019t apply to the drug itself, but rather the emotion it created.\n\n\u201cYou get drawn to that confidence, that incredible feeling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re an addict, you\u2019re always an addict. You\u2019re just not using.\u201d\n\nNate now experiences short term memory problems, issues with his lung capacity and from a social stand point damage his personal life, avoiding group situations where he believes he could be tempted.\n\nHe believes the education of youth is the strongest way forward in defending them from the effects and future of addiction.\n\nSince that moment Nate has been a voice of community encouragement to seek help, nearly 10 years clean.\n\nFrom his own experience, Nate said if students know the long and short term effects of drug consumption and discussed them in an open, honest forum they may think twice before following in his footsteps.\n\nHe said if he had known them at the time, he would never have taken the first steps down that path.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to go away while there are other people out there who can prosper from other people\u2019s misery,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the perception of illicit drug use being prevalent in just low income communities was not the case.\n\nNate said the South West was equally susceptible, if not more because the money was there to access it.\n\n\u201cWhen it starts affecting their families they\u2019ll realise it\u2019s not a poor person\u2019s problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey (youth) wont believe the lengths they\u2019ll go to, to feed their habit on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nMargaret River Senior High School principal Andrew Host said the school implemented drug education into their curriculum as a mandatory class.\n\nHe believes it is a societal issue growing in Western Australia.\n\n\u201cMargaret River wouldn\u2019t be immune to that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Host said the program implemented aspects surrounding the issue of drugs, discussing it with students and giving them the information and skills to make informed decisions.\n\n\u201cIt focuses on harm minimisation across the board,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Augusta Margaret River Shire introduced a strengthening youth plan for 2014-2018.\n\nDo you believe education of youth is the key to drug prevention?
