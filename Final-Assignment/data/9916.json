She was leaving the venue as I was walking along. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t think she believed me. I couldn\u2019t believe it was happening. \n \n\u201cI think she believed me towards the end. She was really, really lovely. \n \n\u201cI was a big fan of Gavin and Stacey and it worked really well with it being a bar as well when I was using alcohol-related products. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s great for me because the venue already holds great Welsh icons\u2019 photographs and other artworks \u2013 so it fits in perfectly! \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s so bold you can spot it from across the street.\u201d", "source": "Wales Online"}
