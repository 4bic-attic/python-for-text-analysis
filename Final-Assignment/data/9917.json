The residents, who are members of the Curtain Call thespian group, did so in A Trip to Remember , a play they wrote, produced and performed to an overflow crowd in their community\u2019s auditorium. \n\nGus the bus driver and a tour bus company hostess named Twinky took this eclectic group on a journey filled with laughter and quirky surprises at every turn, so to speak. \n\nTheir original bus broke down, so a reserve bus \u2013 an old school bus with the universal adaptor of duct tape holding it together \u2013 had to be put into service. This bus had paper fans that served as air conditioning and a radio that worked only when the bus headed north and only when it was going uphill. \n\nThe southern charm of Twinky and the \u201cgo-get-\u2019em\u201d attitude of Gus kept the bus ride going smoothly until the eccentric personalities of passengers such as the Diva, the Forgetful One, the Sleeper, the Complainer, the Man-Crazy One and the Lone Male took center stage. \n\nThe \u201cElegant Dinner\u201d at McDonald\u2019s, a 5-Star Shady Rest Hotel stay, a flat tire and a midnight Grand Canyon arrival did not impress the passengers, but beautiful star gazing and a lucky $140 million Michigan Lottery winning ticket for the entire group turned their complaints into cheers by the end of the journey. \n\nCurtain Call thanked Fox Run\u2019s General Services staff and contractor Mike Risco of Risco, Inc., for their assistance. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/news/local/novi/2015/09/02/fox-run-novi/714796", "source": "Hometown Life"}
