He wins at the time you need it the most, with four of his seven victories for Toronto coming after losses. He dominates virtually every time he steps on the mound. And he takes that ball, and hangs onto it, deep into games, year after year.\n\nPrice, with 208 1/3 innings, has eclipsed 200 innings in five of his six full seasons, making at least 31 starts a year.\n\nThe man will be paid, more than any free-agent starter in baseball this winter, with a payday that surely will surpass $200 million.\n\nIf you\u2019re the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Blue Jays, how can you not be salivating over the thought of having him in your rotation for the next seven years?\n\nConsidering the way he\u2019s dominating the American League, can you just imagine what he\u2019d do in the pitching-friendly National League with no DH and weaker lineups?\n\nPrice wisely won\u2019t divulge any preference for his next home, but considering the way he raves about the Cardinals\u2019 organization and its fan base, and living a five-hour drive away in Nashville, it\u2019s no secret that the Cardinals would have an advantage.\n\nSure, the Cardinals are leading the National League in ERA without him, but with Adam Wainwright on the DL and no real ace to carry them this postseason, they may realize just how badly they could use him in October.\n\nCan you imagine a rotation of Price, Wainwright, Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn and Carlos Martinez in 2016?\n\nOr if you\u2019re the Cubs, how about Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester and Price sitting atop the rotation? Price can also expect significant interest from San Francisco and Boston, where the Giants and Red Sox look to re-tool in modest to significant fashions.\n\nThe greatest thing that happened to all of the free-agent suitors for Price is that he was not traded in July to the Dodgers. If he gone to Los Angeles, he might have easily fallen in love with the place, just as Zack Greinke has done, giving the Dodgers the upper hand.\n\nGreinke will opt out of his contract after the season, but considering how much he enjoys everything but the traffic in Los Angeles, he\u2019s expected to return, only with a fatter bank account.\n\nIf the Dodgers want to go for the kill, they could conceivably have Clayton Kershaw, Greinke and Price all in the same rotation, giving them the most powerful starting trio since the Hall of Fame triumvirate of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in Atlanta.\n\nIf you already have a $307 million payroll, what\u2019s another $30 million salary on the books?\n\nPrice, widely regarded as one of baseball\u2019s ultimate teammates and role models, won\u2019t bother thinking about free agency until November.\n\nFor now, he\u2019s got a division, pennant and World Series to win, and if he keeps pitching like this, will have the world at his feet.\n\nAnd the 2015 Cy Young award in his trophy case.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t just out there pitching for stats or a paycheck, he\u2019s helping carry the Blue Jays\u2019 down the stretch, going 7-1 with a 2.17 ERA in nine starts since his arrival, all in meaningful and impactful games.\n\nIt\u2019s this continuing dominance, and Keuchel\u2019s horrid outing Wednesday night when he gave up nine earned runs and three homers in 4 2/3 innings, with his ERA soaring 15.3% from 2.22 to 2.56, that tips the scales to Price\u2019s favor. Sure, it may be unfair, considering that Keuchel has been brilliant all year, leading the league with 17 victories (to Price\u2019s 16) and innings (211.1 to Price\u2019s 208.1), while pitching at least six innings in every start and yielding two or fewer runs in 18 starts.\n\nYet, this is September, in the middle of playoff races, when everything is magnified.\n\nAnd please, no one else should be in the AL Cy Young conversation.\n\nSonny Gray (13-7, 2.56 ERA) of the Oakland A\u2019s is having a splendid year, but not as strong as Price and Keuchel, who are pitching in pressure-packed games. Chris Archer (12-12, 2.69 ERA) of the Tampa Bay Rays, who has 241 strikeouts, is a top five Cy Young candidate, but also falls short.\n\nPrice is poised to join Kershaw, Greinke and Tim Lincecum as the only active pitchers with multiple Cy Young awards on their resumes.\n\nHe could potentially have a Cy Young award and World Series trophy in six weeks, and by the holidays, could be guaranteed at least $200 million, setting up future generations of his family.\n\nSometimes, nice guys really can finish first.\n\nGALLERY: MLB postseason matchups, as they stand", "source": "USA Today"}
