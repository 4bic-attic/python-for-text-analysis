Our partnership with Common Impact has been fundamental in this effort, and has allowed us to provide our employees with many meaningful experiences that remain with them for years to come.\u201d \n\nFifteen years ago, skills-based volunteering was largely relegated to pro bono activities at law firms. Since then, companies across all industries have realized that donating their talent is one of the strongest ways to make an immediate and tangible impact on the communities in which they operate. Now, more than 50% of companies nationwide have a pro bono program.[1]\u00a0 \n\nCommon Impact points to two key factors in this new wave of corporate service.\u00a0 One, Millennials entering the workforce are demanding an ability to have an impact on their communities as part of their employment package.\u00a0 55% of Millennials are influenced to take a job based on the cause work their potential employer undertakes, and 97% want to use their skills to make an impact.[2]\u00a0 Two, companies are seeing the business value in engaging employees in skills-based service, largely through the talent development, engagement and retention benefits they see from these programs. Earlier this month, Deloitte University Press released an article, Purpose Driven Talent, underscoring the strong connection between skills based volunteering and corporate leadership development by highlighting Fidelity and Common Impact\u2019s program.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cFor us, Common Impact is a powerful tool for talent development; giving junior associates a strong sense of bringing a project from initiation to completion and emerging leaders the opportunities to fully manage delivery of projects that will have immediate benefits for their communities.\u201d Steve Neff, Enterprise Chief Technology Officer, Fidelity\u00a0Investments. \n\nSince its inception, Common Impact has invested more than $13 million through the talents of its corporate partners in local communities across North America, Europe and Asia.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cCommon Impact's model of matching corporate skills with capacity building for nonprofits has been a boon to Boston Partners in Education. Three different talented teams over a ten year period provided critical help to us that exceeded our greatest expectations. The latest website project is critical to our work serving over 3,000 students annually in Boston Public Schools by matching them with trained volunteer academic mentors,\u201d stated Pamela Civins, Executive Director of Boston Partners in Education. \n\nNow, Common Impact and its partners are looking forward to the next generation of skills-based service.\u00a0 \u201cCommon Impact\u2019s first 15 years was dedicated to establishing skills-based volunteering as one of our society\u2019s strongest philanthropic tools.\u00a0 That case is now proven,\" continued Holly.\u00a0 \"Our next 15 years will focus on making skills-based volunteering as accessible and effective as possible to nonprofits and companies of all sizes and sectors.\u00a0 We want to move skills-based volunteering from a new idea to a natural and ongoing resource for our communities.\u00a0 Pro Bono Perspectives is meant to serve as the first and critical step in realizing that vision.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nAbout Common Impact \n\nCommon Impact is a nationally-recognized nonprofit that works to build a society\u00a0in which individuals and businesses invest their unique talents towards a shared purpose: strengthening the local communities in which we live and work.
