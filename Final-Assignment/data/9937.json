ZI and Zaid challenged the validity of the state law in the Federal Court. \u00a0But Justice Raus, writing for a 5-judge panel, said that the constitutional protections for freedom of expression must be read together with provisions declaring Islam as the country's religion and giving states the power to control or restrict\u00a0propagation of any religious doctrine or belief among persons professing the religion of Islam.", "source": "Religion Clause"}
