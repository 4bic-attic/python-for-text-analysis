Her sons\u2019 are Joaquin (7 1/2 years old about to start second grade), Mateo (5 years old and about to start kindergarten) and Elias (2 years old and currently attending preschool). \n \nYou\u2019ll see from the photos, they are constantly moving. \n \n\n \nJessica works full-time as the Director of Community Service at a local hospital. She is also an avid boxer, which she took up about a year and a half ago after a tough divorce. \n \n\n \n\u201cBoxing has been a great way to get out some of the anger and stress of the past year. It\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m completely anonymous (no one\u2019s boss, daughter, girlfriend, etc). I\u2019m doing it just for me. It also helps me stay physically strong because soon these\u00a0boys are\u00a0going to be bigger than me!\u201d \n \nJessica says her evenings are \u201ccomical, chaotic and sweet\u201d but evenings with three boys are tough when she\u2019s totally spent from the rest of the day. \n \n\n \n\u201cI\u2019d love to have more patience with the energy level of my boys. I know they are excited to see each other after the day and want to play, but I\u2019m usually so \u2018done\u2019 at\u00a0the end of the day. I just want them to get some sleep so I can have down time before doing it all over again.\u201d \n \nOn Wednesdays, Jessica leaves work early to go to her boxing gym at 3:15pm. After she\u2019s done, she picks up her oldest son from summer camp.\u00a0Jessica\u2019s mother (who works at the same hospital) picks up her younger two boys from daycare and takes them home. \n \nJessica says the kids are usually starving when they get home so making dinner is first on\u00a0her agenda.\u00a0She has to make something that will get a meal on the table as\u00a0quickly\u00a0as possible and figuring out what to cook is Jessica\u2019s least favorite part of the day. \n \n\n \n\u201cMy middle child, Mateo, is incredibly picky. There\u2019s a limited number of things I can serve that won\u2019t result in\u00a0tears at the table. We are\u00a0working on expanding his palate, but there are nights I just don\u2019t want to deal with a meltdown, so I go the path of least resistance. Scrambled eggs is one thing everyone will eat without a fight.\u201d \n \n\n \nThe boys usually play and roughhouse while Jessica\u00a0cooks\u00a0dinner. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSome of my favorite shots of Jessica\u2019s family are of them doing the \u201cSuperman Prayer\u201d bevfore dinner which is their version of saying grace. \n \n\n \n\n \n\u201cI was a camp counselor for several summers and we had all kinds of creative prayers. The Superman Prayer was one of them. I find physical things keep the boys\u2019 attention more\u00a0than having them close their eyes and be still.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRight after dinner, at about 7pm, they all head upstairs for bed. The early start to bedtime routine seems to be because it takes a considerable amount of time and energy to corral three boys into their respective bedrooms. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe boys brush their teeth and put on their PJs. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThen they\u00a0read books together as a family, which is Jessica\u2019s favorite part of the evening. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAfter books, Jessica lets the kids watch a few videos on YouTube, which she says has \u201can amazingly calming effect on them.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTheir favorites vary from old Bob Ross videos (\u201cHe\u2019s the guy who would paint a picture in half an hour on PBS\u201d) to science experiments (\u201cLately it\u2019s been all about SciShow Kids\u2014it\u2019s a great channel!\u201d). \n \nJessica says her boys \u201cjust soak up knowledge.\u201d \n \nElias, the youngest, goes to bed first. \n \n\n \n\u201cIt can be a challenge to get everyone where they need to be but Elias is not a problem at all. He\u2019s in his own room and all you have to do is turn the light out and shut the door and he\u2019s good.\u201d \n \n\n \n\u201cThe older two take a bit longer.\u201d \n \n\n \n\n \nJessica takes the older two boys into their shared room where she lets them read\u00a0a few more books and watch a few more videos. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nJessica\u2019s ex-husband is not currently\u00a0involved with the kids\u00a0so I asked Jessica about the challenges of\u00a0taking care of three boys on her own. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s more challenging to give everyone the individual attention they need/deserve. My youngest tends to get the short end of the stick because he goes to bed first and is the easiest to put to sleep. But this means he doesn\u2019t really get to spend a long time with me in the evenings.\u201d \n \n\n \nShe says positive things have\u00a0come\u00a0from being a single mom as well. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve bonded a lot\u00a0over\u00a0the last year and I feel like they help each other now too, which is nice to see.\u201d \n \n\n \nI asked Jessica if she had any advice for other single moms of boys. \n \n\u201cDo not get\u00a0attached to anything in your home. It will get destroyed at some point.\u201d \n \n\n \nOnce the\u00a0boys have\u00a0settled, Jessica turns on a lullaby channel on Pandora and lies in bed with one of them (the boys alternate nights) as they go to sleep. \n \n\n \nThey all usually listen to music until at least one of the boys\u00a0falls asleep and Jessica feels it\u2019s safe to exit. \n \n\u201cIt\u00a0can take 15-45 minutes depending on how tired they are. Mateo, my middle child, usually stays up later and generally ends up sleeping in my bed at some point during the night.\u201d \n \n\n \nIf Jessica is lucky, she\u2019ll leave their room at about 8:30pm and head downstairs. \n \n\n \nShe gets things cleaned up and ready for the next day and then either heads up to bed, calls her new boyfriend Doug (who is also an old boyfriend from before she was married) or falls asleep watching TV on the couch. \n \n\u201cI probably fall asleep on the couch at least 75% of the time. It\u2019s like my brain wants to believe I can make it through a whole episode of something but then my body gives up.\u201d \n \n\n \nI asked Jessica what her reaction was to seeing the photos of her evening. \n \n\u201cI was really surprised! It makes our time look a lot more fun than it seems to be when I\u2019m in the middle of everything.\u201d \n \nShe was particularly happy to see the goofy and fun expressions on her boys. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m so happy to see the boys so full of joy. Makes me feel like I\u2019m doing a good job as a mom if they can be that happy after everything that has happened. As chaotic as our evening is, if everyone is fed, semi-clean, and smiling, it\u2019s a WIN.\u201d \n \nJessica thanked me for the experience and said she had been wanting to do something special with the boys since the divorce. \n \n\u201cTheir dad is no longer in the picture so we\u2019ve really bonded over this past year.\u00a0I love having something special just for us\u00a0to remember this time in our lives in a positive way, reminding them of what we do have, instead of what we don\u2019t.\u201d \n \nJessica would still use \u201cchaotic, comical and sweet\u201d to describe her evenings but also added \u201cresilient\u201d to the mix. \n \n\u201cMy boys are amazing and just seeing them smile is such a gift. This experience makes me feel like I\u2019m doing ok and I can handle this on my own.\u201d \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \nThis post is part of the \u201c Wednesday\u00a0Evenings \u201d series sponsored by\u00a0 Allstate .
