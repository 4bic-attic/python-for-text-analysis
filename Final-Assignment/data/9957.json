The issue is a\u00a0much bigger hassle this time than simply canceling a valid preorder\u00a0\u2013 which seems to be their usual mistake to make nowadays \u2013\u00a0instead they are charging\u00a0customers up to seven times for a single\u00a0copy of a game \u2013 that\u2019s\u00a0\u00a3328.93 for a single copy of Super Mario Maker. \n \nA quick glance at Twitter shows the follow\u2026 \n \nHmm got 5 emails from GAME about my order of Super Mario Maker, according to sites this means I might have got charged 5 times. lol awesome. \n \n\u2014 Jason Darby (@JasonDarby) September 7, 2015 \n \n\n \n@eurogamer GAME have charged me 4x for Super Mario Maker, anyone else with this problem? \n \n\u2014 Ragonkai (@Ragonkai) September 7, 2015 \n \n\n \nAny reason why you've charged me 4 times for my Mario Maker Limited Edition bundle?! @GAMEdigital \n \n\u2014 \u00ab\u266a.Dana \u00bb (@mycactusandme) September 7, 2015 \n \n\n \n@GAMEHelps hi, I believe I am being charged 3 times for my order of Super Mario Maker, even though the quantity is only for 1 \n \n\u2014 Jamie (@HaYl064) September 7, 2015 \n \n\n \nOthers on Twitter are panicking, and accusing GAME of \u201c stealing \u201d their money. Obviously this is not the case, and the company will have to rectify their error and refund customers. However, that has not stopped some individual\u00a0accounts to go\u00a0overdrawn. This can be a tad more serious\u00a0than a temporary charge appearing, as even when GAME rectify the error, some banks can still go on to fine customers for letting their accounts fall into that state. \n \nFor example,\u00a0 Barclays cite the following fines will be issued for an overdrawn account. \u201c We refuse a payment from your account because there is not enough money in your account.

Said issues will be resolved within 24 hours. Apologies once again and thank you for your patience. \u201d \n \nGame will go on to try and\u00a0sell more games over the course of 2015. What will happen then? Nobody Knows !", "source": "DarkZero"}
