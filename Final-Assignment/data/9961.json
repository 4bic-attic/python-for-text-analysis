At least one of them was armed with a gun. \n   \nThe incident, which took place just after 12:20 p.m. at a Scotiabank near Islington Ave. and Napa Valley Dr., prompted local schools to go into a hold-and-secure as police scoured the area for the suspects. The hold-and-secure has since been lifted for both York Region District School Board and York Catholic District School Board schools in the region. \n   \nNo injuries were reported in the robbery. \n   \nOfficers are still actively searching the area. \n   \nPolice are urging members of the public to call 911 with any information and not to approach the suspects, who may still be armed. \n   \nMore Crime news on Thestar.com", "source": "Toronto Star Online"}
