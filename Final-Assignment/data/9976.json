Elkin believes it was the result of seven years of unmanaged growth and was double the sheep\u2019s body weight. \n \n#Canberra 's very woolly sheep sets world record for the heaviest fleece according to @rspcaact  http://t.co/vGeOfo7PJ3  pic.twitter.com/nHOw7Lxr4f \n\u2014 ABC News Canberra (@abcnewsCanberra) September 3, 2015  \nThe previous recordholder was Big Ben from New Zealand whose fleece came in at 29kg. \n \n\"We certainly didn\u2019t have the world record as a priority when we sheared Chris,\" RSPCA ACT chief executive Tammy Ven Dange said. \n \n\"But we appreciate the recognition. We can only hope that record is never broken again because it would be unlikely that the animal would live to tell the story.\" \n \nChris\u2019 fleece was donated to a museum and he now lives happily at a hobby farm in New South Wales. \n \nAnd this is what he looks like now. \n \nFor those needing your Chris video fix! He's feeling much better. #CHRIStheSHEEP  #Chris  @rspcaact  #Canberra  #CBR  pic.twitter.com/56ZAJAAJOm \n\u2014 Tammy Ven Dange (@tvendange) September 9, 2015  \nBit of a change, alright. \n \nHT: breakingnews.ie \n\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.
