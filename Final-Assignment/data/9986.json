Not so at a Costco in California last weekend. \n\nA 78-year-old shopper said he was punched in the face by another customer after complaining to the man about taking too many Nutella waffles. \n\nThe unidentified shopper said he was reaching for a waffle at a sample table at the Costco in Burbank when another man swooped in and took all of the remaining samples off the table, according to Burbank police. The shopper grumbled about this, and that\u2019s when police say Derrick Gharabighi, 24, hit the older man. \n\nThe man went to the hospital with a cut and swelling on the left side of his face, said CNN affiliate KTLA. \n\nGharabighi was charged with felony elder abuse and personal infliction of great bodily injury against a person over 70 years of age. He was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. His next court date is next month \n\nHe\u2019s also facing a backlash on his Instagram page, KTLA reported, with people, outraged by his alleged actions, slamming him. \n\n\u201cDid you seriously punch an old man in the face?\u201d asks one commenter, while another tries to give Gharabighi some advice: \u201cLay off the nutella waffles dude.\u201d", "source": "KFRU-AM"}
