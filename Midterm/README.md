# Midterm exam

For the midterm, we will have an exam that tests your knowledge of the Python
programming language. This folder contains sample exams from previous years.
Note that these **may not be representative for the midterm you will have.**

At the moment there is only one sample exam. As the course develops over the year,
this collection will grow.

Last year, our students said the exam was a bit too easy for them. We want to
emphasize that **this exam isn't meant to be difficult.** It's meant as a check
to assure that your knowledge of the language is sufficient to tackle the final
assignment.

Having that said, this year's midterm will cover more theory and will be a little
more in-depth. We will discuss everything you need to know for the exam in class.
