# Notebooks

Good to see you in this folder! This is where you will actually learn how to program.
Our course makes use of Jupyter Notebooks, which provide an environment where you can
practice python and make notes about your work, all in your browser.

There are two ways to run a Jupyter Notebook, but you do need to have the notebook
files on your computer. If you haven't done so already, please use `git clone git@github.com:evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis.git`
or download the course as a [zipped folder](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/archive/master.zip).

The first way to run our notebooks is to use the Launcher application that comes
with anaconda. Search for the 'Jupyter notebook' application. (In older versions,
this might be called 'iPython Notebook'.) Start it, and navigate to the notebook
folder. Click one of the notebooks to run it.

The second way to run the notebooks is to go to this folder using the command line,
and then type 'jupyter notebook'. Click one of the notebooks to run it. If you don't
know how to use the command line, read [this](../NLP-topics/commandline.md).
