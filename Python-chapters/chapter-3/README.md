# Chapter 3 -- Batteries included

Python is sometimes described as a 'batteries-included' language. What people mean
by this is that the language comes with a rich collection of modules that you can
use to solve everyday tasks. There's no need to write any specialized code to do
common tasks: others have probably solved the task for you and wrote an efficient
implementation. This chapter is devoted to the many modules that come with Python.

Much of what we'll cover below is also in [the Python library reference](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/index.html).
Below is a list of sections in the library reference we think are most important
for our purpose of analyzing text.

The first four are full sections that cover the same material as chapters 1 and 2.
You may want to read these first, but you can also skip them and move to the built-ins.
(They're great reference material, though!)

* **1.** [Introduction](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/intro.html)
* **2.** [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html)
* **3.** [Built-in Constants](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/constants.html)
* **4.** [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html)

We will focus on these sections:

* **6.1** [string](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/string.html)
* **6.2.** [re](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/re.html)
* **8.1.** [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html)
* **8.3.** [collections](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/collections.html)
* **9.2.** [math](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/math.html)
* **9.6.** [random](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html)
* **10.1.** [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html)
* **10.2.** [functools](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html)
* **11.2.** [os.path](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/os.path.html)
* **11.7.** [glob](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/glob.html)
* **12.1.** [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/pickle.html)
* **13.2.** [gzip](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/gzip.html)
* **14.1.** [csv](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html)
* **19.2.** [json](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/json.html)
* **26.3** [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/doctest.html)
