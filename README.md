# Python for text analysis

This is a practical course in Python, geared towards those who want to get some hands-on experience working with language data.
That means this is not a classical programming course, and so we will not cover things like Object-Oriented Programming in detail.
Our number one goal is for you to become an independent programmer, who is able to properly manage their code. 
No knowledge of programming is required or presupposed.

This course is a work-in-progress. The first full draft should be finished by September 2016 (at the start of the academic year).
