# Syllabus Python for text analysis

Welcome to the course **Python for text analysis**. During this course, you will learn how to work with the programming language Python, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of text. From week 44 (starting October 31st 2016) until week 5 (starting January 30th 2017), there will be two lectures a week.


## Course materials
All course materials can be found at: https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis.

## Grading policy
You will be graded on:
* **[35%] assignments**: starting from week 45, you will be asked to hand in an assignment before Tuesday 15:00pm. Submission is done through Blackboard. There are three possible grades for an assignment: **not OK (5)**, **OK (7)**, and **good (9)**. Submission after the deadline results in one point deduction of your grade. In addition, we do not guarantee feedback if your submission is after the deadline. You have to hand in all assignments in order to be able to get a passing grade for the course. The weight for each assignment is as follows:
  * **[4%] assignment 1**
  * **[4%] assignment 2**
  * **[9%] assignment 3**
  * **[9%] assignment 4**
  * **[9%] assignment 5**
* **[20%] exam**: on the 15th of December, there will be an exam on paper, of which the goal is to test your understanding of Python and its standard library.
* **[45%] final assignments**: the final part of the course consists of a final assignment, for which you will work on your own code project. As part of the final assignment, we ask you to present your work. You will not receive a grade for this presentation, but it is compulsory.

## Attendance policy
You are expected to attempt to attend all lectures. You are allowed to miss two lectures at most. After more than two absences, you are no longer able to obtain credits for the course.  

## Plagarism
Basically, please don't cheat. Let us know if you have worked together with someone or if you used code from [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
